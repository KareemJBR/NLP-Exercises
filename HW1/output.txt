Comedians not crime preoccupy New York voters  From LEONARD DOYLE in New York 
IN A LITTER of sleeping bags on the floor of the Gethsemane Church in East Berlin Irene Schwidurski who had not taken any solid food for four days was trying to explain her reasons to a Western journalist with the help of a pocket dictionary  She was she explained absolutely opposed to Gewalt power 
No he objected surely she meant violence she was committed to non-violence  An appeal to the dictionary supplied both meanings 
And suddenly the dispute seemed unimportant in East Germany might is violence  That is the large reason why she is there with about 25 other people waiting quietly to one side of the altar in the church which has become the place in the city where freedom most nearly is 
The proximate cause is more simple  The hunger strike was started on 4 October by a woman called Angela Kunze who is she says a physiotherapist part-time circus clown and student of theology With three jobs together I can work 
That was before the running street-battles of the weekend when a demonstration around the church was broken up by a police riot which lasted five hours  Irene Schwidurski missed all those since for many years she has refused to observe the major public holidays of the GDR 1 May and 7 October the date the state was founded 
In line with this principle she ignored the Gorbachev visit and went to the cinema to watch a film that had been banned for 20 years since it deals with the Russian invasion of 1945  When she emerged Rosa Luxemburg Platz was full of police with lorries and water-cannon who cordoned off the broad cobbled street that runs out of the town centre to the church 
The underground was still working and brought her near the church where she could see the crowd and the candles outside  The young policemen in the cordon were polite she said but an older officer told her to get off home in obscene terms 
She pushed through the cordon anyway and stayed in church until 3am through all the worst of the police violence  It was then that she read Angela Kunze 's manifesto written in blue on a long ribbon of paper above her head where she rests against the wall I am fasting to cleanse myself of fear and hopelessness hate and violence impatience and the lust for novelty 
I am fasting because I see no other way to express my protest against the ways in which our politicians brazenly keep up appearances and celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the state as their victory  I am fasting because unlike our state media I am worried about the great number of people who have left our country 
I am fasting to live in solidarity with all who suffer and are persecuted because they have committed themselves to social justice  I am fasting in the hope that others will take part for an hour or for days and that we will show our personal commitment to this country by limiting our material needs 
This is high-minded and perhaps romantic but so is the opposition so are the large things that they want like freedom and justice  It is worth noting that there are few narrow political aims involved and that repeated reference is made to our country East Germany 
This is not a movement for reunification  Nor is it exactly a movement for westernisation 
There is a strong streak of greenery both as a policy and as a political style  The side walls of the church are covered in documents 
There are blurred photographs of the weekend fighting since totalitarianism needs power over history these too are subversive  There are various manifestos many of the hunger strikers have put up their own alongside Angela Kunze 's 
One woman 's reasons include the memory of a friend murdered while trying to cross the frontier  All these look to Western eyes childish as well as amateurish 
The paper is coarse and absorbent little is even typewritten the predominant style is Blue Peter make-your-own-revolution large lettering and primary colours  The most professional is a leaflet expressing solidarity from Poland 
Above on a page torn from an exercise book is a handwritten question Where was our solidarity with Poland under martial law  But coming in from the shabby streets outside which smell of coal and cement dust and Wartburg exhausts the effect is of life and excitement 
One of the New Forum posters shows a well-drawn man addressing a largely faceless crowd one of whom is holding up a placard that reads Keep it short  The slogan on top is Stop the monologue 
Not the least power of a totalitarian state is the power to bore the people out of their right minds  In this sense the unpredictability of all that happens in the church is a necessary precondition of freedom 
The services at six in the evening seem unstructured  They are certainly unpredictable 
There was mime and a resolutely modern organ piece one evening between announcements and prayers  Hardly anyone in the packed congregations of about 1,500 people seemed to know either the hymns or the prayers 
Bishop Forck of Berlin-Brandenburg gave an account of his negotiations with the Mayor of Berlin at the beginning of the week  They had spoken for an hour and 45 minutes and one of the bishop 's assistants is setting up a programme of regular meetings between the local party and the opposition 
There is still an abyss or several to be crossed but the bishop was applauded with vast intensity as he told how he had demanded the release of the 150 people reckoned to have been arrested during the street fighting and had been told that complaints of police brutality would be investigated if the names of the victims were submitted in writing to the authorities  Pastor Hans Simon preached on the unlikely text that the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath 
Yet as he developed this the government emerged as the Pharisees weighing down the people with unjust laws and the right claimed by Jesus to satisfy his disciples ' hunger became the right of East Germans to satisfy their hunger for truth  Again he was interrupted repeatedly with applause but this was a crowd which does not cheer 
They only clap with extraordinary vigour  All through the service and all day and night people come and go moving intently along the walls listening and reading everything 
Some stop to talk to the hunger strikers  Irene Schwidurski said They come and tell us their stories of the weekend or they come because of what they saw of it on Western TV 
And they come because they want to be rid of their fear it gives them a completely new feeling of life to overcome their fear and come here  Outside the police are no longer present in uniformed strength 
There is still a great deal of fear about  This is a city where people move away in a marked manner when you open a notebook and turn their faces from a camera 
Only the plain-clothes thugs of the security police who can easily be told by their well-fed oafishness their training shoes and anoraks go out of their way to move close in and stare down at anyone writing  The church steps are lined with candles burning all the time so that now they rise from a layer of wax four inches high 
The plain-clothes goons lounge in the lamplight below and above them children work patiently through the evenings tending this rampart of candles against the wind  THE LATEST joke in Tokyo is that the leader of the Socialist Party Takako Doi slipped on a pachinko ball 
She is nursing a chipped elbow and an image that has been dented by allegations of party members taking kickbacks from the barons of pachinko a form of pinball which is a national passion  Ms Doi is an avowed addict of what might be described as watching hundreds of tiny steel balls clatter through a maze of pins on a vertical board 
Pachinko is a Â£3.8bn-a-year industry which has a Svengali-like hold over a quarter of the adult population  Some admit they like it because the noise of hundreds of machines helps numb the mind after a hard day at work 
It numbed the mind of one woman so much recently that she left her baby to suffocate inside her car while hoping to hit the jackpot a bucketful of balls which can be exchanged for jars of coffee or pairs of tights  It also has connections with the Yakuza Japan 's equivalent of the Mafia 
Most of the country 's 15,000 parlours are run by Japan 's Korean minority who have been denied the right to Japanese citizenship  As with all good scandals it is a complicated story 
Chapter One begins with allegations printed in one of the more respectable weekly magazines that do their best to ruin the reputation of everyone in the public eye  It alleged the industry had paid off several Socialist MPs to block legislation in parliament that would have laid pachinko parlours more open to the scrutiny of the tax authorities 
With Ms Doi 's passion for pachinko and the industry 's reputation for large-scale tax evasion both public knowledge who could have asked for more  A federation of recreation industry unions compiled a list of more than 100 MPs from ruling and opposition parties who allegedly received huge sums of money from pachinko barons for the past five years 
Chapter Two seemed even better  Newspaper journalists came up with the information that the pachinko barons had been just as liberal with their cash as the Recruit corporation had been with political donations and cheap shares not long before 
As in the Recruit scandal the only party to be left out were the Communists and the lion 's share of the money went to the the ruling Liberal Democrat Party  The Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama ordered all cabinet members yesterday to search campaign fund records for any contributions from an industry notorious for tax evasion and links with organised crime 
So far at least two cabinet members have confirmed acceptance of campaign contributions from the pachinko industry  The next chapter saw the Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu being questioned in parliament about the Â£2,000 he is alleged to have received 
It was not for nothing that he was chosen as Mr Squeaky Clean after the sexual and financial aberrations of his two predecessors  The most exciting admissions the opposition could squeeze out of him were Yes I have played pachinko and Yes in some respects I like it 
The Liberal Democrats are such past masters at riding out scandals that they are remaining calm simply instructing all cabinet members to report within a week whether they have received any donations from the pachinko industry  The Socialists though are not taking it lying down 
They have issued an eight-page statement which exonerates their members and puts the knife into all other parties  It 's an anti-Socialist plot said the party 's secretary-general Tsuruo Yamaguchi threatening to take the magazine to court 
He admitted the party and individual MPs received a total of nearly Â£38,000 but insisted it was all legal and there had never been any attempt to favour the pachinko industry in parliament  He went on to allege that the Liberal Democrats had received 15 times as much in donations but refrained from naming names 
That will no doubt be done by the press clearly bored at not having had a good scandal to get its teeth into for all of two months  A soldier in Tiananmen Square shoos away a teacher and her class from the Monument to the People 's Heroes before a ceremony marking the foundation of a Communist youth group 
THE INDIAN government tried yesterday to deflect attention from the Bofors corruption scandal by linking one of the fiercest opposition critics of Rajiv Gandhi the Prime Minister with shady financial dealing  This coincided with newspaper reports purporting to detail the financial arrangements by which millions of dollars were siphoned from the Bofors howitzer contract and allegedly paid to senior Indian officials 
The revelations which are seriously embarrassing Mr Gandhi 's Congress I Party were accompanied by documents apparently leaked to the Indian press by Swedish sources  They provided more circumstantial evidence that despite official denials in Stockholm and New Delhi big bribes were paid to companies controlled by Indian agents 
But the reports still fell short of conclusively identifying the ultimate recipients of the money  Faced with the prospect of a stream of disclosures as the general election approaches Mr Gandhi 's advisers have apparently concluded that their best defence is also to attack the opposition with the corruption stick 
The leader of the Janata Dal party VP Singh has found himself and his family under scrutiny in recent weeks over highly suspect allegations that his son controlled a secret bank-account in the Caribbean island of St Kitts  The allegations that Mr Singh a former Congress I finance minister had stashed millions of dollars in a numbered St Kitts account were made in August in the Arab Times of Kuwait not previously known for its scoops about India 
It said the account was controlled by Mr Singh 's son Ajeya a New York-based accountant  To many the report smacked of an attempted smear by Congress I 's dirty-tricks department 
Ajeya Singh returned to India and tried to refute the allegations pointing out numerous flaws in the report and offered his passport as evidence that he had not been in St Kitts when he was supposed to have signed documents opening the account with the now-defunct bank the First Trust Corporation  He also said he had never been to St Kitts 
Despite this VP Singh 's enemies kept the issue alive with the help of George Maclean a former managing director of First Trust  Mr Maclean who had fled St Kitts leaving a pile of debts surfaced in Canada claiming that the account had existed 
When challenged by Mr Singh Mr Maclean obliged the Janata Dal leader 's enemies by suggesting that Ajeya Singh was a liar  Mr Maclean 's reliability as a bank manager can be judged from his admission that he was not very good at mathematics hence the mistakes in calculating interest on Mr Singh 's alleged account 
It has been reported from St Kitts that several of Mr Maclean 's former co-directors are wanted on drugs charges  Although the affair stinks of a set-up the government has been able to manipulate the publicity to deflect some of the heat from the Bofors affair 
Allegations of Swedish corruption have been countered with suggestions of Caribbean fraud  Ajeya Singh who voluntarily provided documentation of his personal finances is under official investigation 
At this early stage of the Indian election campaign the debate is not over who is most suited to run the country but which politician is the least bent  ONLY three weeks into his term South Africa 's President FW de Klerk took what may turn out to be a milestone decision and announced the unconditional release of all but one of the black activists jailed more than 20 years ago in the Rivonia treason trial 
Even more extraordinary was the fact that Nelson Mandela the sixth and most eminent member of the group appeared to have negotiated the terms of the release of his colleagues who are expected to be freed this weekend  Although Pretoria said the release of Mr Mandela himself was not on the agenda that decision appears to be his own 
Mr Mandela is thought to want trusted lieutenants such as Walter Sisulu to ensure everything is in place before he leaves jail to reassume the reins of the ANC leadership  Mr de Klerk 's announcement is being seen as recognition finally that the South African government will have to deal with the black majority through the leadership of the ANC if civil war is not to wipe the republic off the face of Africa 
Mr de Klerk 's statement was also interpreted as a favour to Margaret Thatcher who is facing increased pressure for sanctions against South Africa at the Commonwealth summit next week  He failed however to get the rapturous reception he may have expected from his chief apologist on the international scene 
Rumours that Britain would ask for anti-apartheid sanctions to be relaxed were quashed although the Prime Minister offered some encouragement by calling the release a major step in the right direction  Hungary appeared to take a step in the right direction when its rulers voted to transmute the old Hungarian Socialist Workers ' Party into a new reformist-led Socialist Party and in effect divorced the party from the state 
No one was quite sure whether this was a good idea however as some of the old party 's members refused to recognise the new party though they hedged their bets by saying they might consider applying for membership  The new party published a list of past mistakes including the Communist Party 's forcible suppression of the opposition in 1948 and a list of proposed remedies headed by the creation of a multi-party system 
But while their leaders considered these lofty goals the party 's bureaucrats had more immediate problems on their hands the prospect of unemployment  Now that the party can no longer call on state finances it will have to streamline its bureaucracy and has already decided to hand back to the nation all superfluous assets including the party 's holiday homes hotels and its headquarters 
The East German leadership at last showed some reaction to the enormous vote of no confidence expressed by its citizens over the past weeks  The Politburo issued a statement regretting for the first time the mass exodus to the West 
It even admitted that there were problems a slight euphemism given the tens of thousands of people who had attended mass protests up and down the country and hinted that the government might be to blame  Although the move was hailed as sensational at first sight the vagueness of the language used to promise travel opportunities and media that are close to life failed to convince observers that the leadership had significantly softened its attitude 
Few expect change while Erich Honecker remains leader  Meanwhile China East Germany 's biggest ally had to step up patrols along its border with Hong Kong after creating to some extent its own refugee problem 
In a fit of pique Peking suspended an agreement with Hong Kong to take back Chinese economic refugees who cross into the colony illegally  The dispute was triggered by Hong Kong 's decision to allow a top Chinese swimmer Yang Yang who had sought political asylum to travel to the United States 
China had demanded that he be returned home  The residents of the Soviet town of Voronezh experienced a rather more exotic kind of refugee 
According to Tass no less the town was terrorised by visitors from outer space small-headed hominoids about 12ft tall who landed their flying saucer in the local park and then went walkabout  Tass quoted eminent local scientists as confirming the incident 
Perhaps even the outer galaxy has its own Erich Honecker  IT WAS one of those days which news editors will remember on their death-beds 
A wafer-thin election victory returned the British Labour Party to power after 13 years  China exploded its first nuclear device 
And exactly a quarter of a century ago today Nikita Khrushchev fell  As glasnost has its way and Khrushchev 's rehabilitation proceeds apace the occasion has not gone unnoticed 
And there is plenty of food for thought  For one thing the memoirs of several surviving actors in the drama have appeared with compelling new details of the intrigue 
Far more pertinently the parallels with what is happening now scream at anyone with the slightest sense of history  Khrushchev 's was the first and only involuntary departure of an established Kremlin leader 
But the problems and discontent of today far outstrip the grumblings heard in 1964  Could history repeat itself 
The superficial similarities might make a lesser man than Mikhail Gorbachev tremble  Take for example an article this week in the Ogonyok magazine by Alexei Adzhubey 
A former editor of Izvestia who was at the Central Committee plenum of 1964 which accepted the resignation of his father-in-law on the grounds of age and health Mr Adzhubey is perfectly placed to recall the stifling atmosphere in the Politburo court at the time  Then as now he says basic goods suddenly disappeared from the shops 
This artificial deficit vanished almost as soon as Khrushchev had departed  He writes that while the state plan of the day was coming apart at the seams Khrushchev was toying with radical reform that would reshape the Stalinist economy and pondering sweeping changes in the constitution of 1936 
Shades indeed of Mr Gorbachev today  It was all too much for Khrushchev 's colleagues notably Leonid Brezhnev unequivocally identified as organizer of the coup and Mikhail Suslov in charge of ideology in those years but also Yuri Andropov a Central Committee secretary in 1964 who 18 years later would succeed Brezhnev as the Soviet leader 
Gennady Voronov another Politburo member of 1964 says that the plot was in progress for a year although he was not in the know  But a few days before Khrushchev was summoned back to Moscow from the Black Sea for his political execution Mr Voronov received an unexpected invitation to go hunting with Brezhnev 
Andropov was there too and on the drive back to Moscow we talked about what was going to happen  Andropov produced a list of names with crosses against them and I understood I was practically the last Presidium member who had not been sworn in 
Andropov added that if Khrushchev resisted he would produce documents showing the latter 's signature on the warrants of many arrested during the 1935-37 purges  In the event the appointed victim went tearfully but quietly 
Two months ago Pyotr Shelest the former Ukrainian party leader who was also in the Presidium gave Moscow News a moving if possibly self-serving account of the moments after Khrushchev had been informed of his fate  It was the worst ordeal of my life 
Nikita Sergeyevich asked to be allowed to say a few words to the Central Committee plenum that would be held immediately afterwards  Brezhnev and Suslov said no 
Nikita Sergeyevich started to cry tears rolled down his cheeks  If it is so then I get what I deserve 
Write a resignation application for me and I 'll sign it  it was hard to look at him 
Even now I see Khrushchev 's face in tears  I 'll remember it at my death hour 
So could something similar happen now  The short answer almost certainly is no 
For one thing the Politburo reshuffle last month has strengthened him  The instigators of a palace coup would have to take into account Mr Gorbachev 's other role as the elected president of the Supreme Soviet a parliament becoming more influential by the week 
The risk would be at least constitutional conflict at worst the civil war to which Mr Gorbachev himself has referred however dismissively in recent months  Ordinary citizens moreover now dare speak out while the party 's standing is the lowest in 70 years 
Any plotters would have to mount little short of a full-scale coup involving probably the army and certainly the KGB  Finally at 58 Mr Gorbachev is still at the height of his powers 
Read Mr Adzhubey and you sense a Khrushchev who at 70 knew that his end was near  Mr Gorbachev you feel is only starting 
EAST GERMANY 'S leaders yesterday released most of the demonstrators arrested last Saturday and let a whiff of glasnost into the state-controlled press as part of their new conciliatory approach  In Bonn meanwhile the government announced that East Germany had agreed to let 600 of its refugees in Bonn 's embassy in Warsaw go to the West 
East Germany had agreed to give them papers allowing them to go to the country of their choice and they were expected to leave Poland in the very near future  People could hardly believe their eyes when they opened their newspapers yesterday morning alongside the ritual party propaganda there was genuine criticism and complaints 
The Communist youth paper Junge Welt printed a complaint by show-business personalities that colleagues had been arrested harassed or forbidden to appear for defying orders not to read out an appeal for reforms during their performances  A writer in the Berliner Zeitung said the authorities ' failure to respond to complaints had created a feeling of insecurity 
Even the official television news broadcast comments by a building worker that people need a little more freedom and the shops should have a little more in them  This sudden glasnost unthinkable a week ago was evidently the result of the Politburo statement on Wednesday calling for discussion of the country 's problems and for media that were close to life 
However party guidelines circulating in East Berlin forbade any attacks on the socialist state or the leading role of the Communist Party  They also made it clear that the party fears that New Forum and other opposition groups could turn into mass movements 
New Forum tried to take the Politburo up on its offer to talk and again demanded legal status so that it would not constantly be accused of subversion  Erich Honecker the party leader spoke about the country 's problems for the first time in an address to party leaders but simply echoed the Politburo statement 
He flatly rejected talks with the opposition saying We do n't need suggestions for the improvement of socialism that are really intended to cause its demise  It is not known how many of the people arrested in last Saturday 's protests on the night of East Germany 's 40th anniversary have been freed 
About 150 are estimated to be still in jail  The announcement yesterday said 11 people mostly with criminal records were being held on charges of arson looting and violence 
Wolfgang Vogel the lawyer who negotiated deals for East Germans who took refuge in West German missions in the East bloc had earlier appealed to the government to free the demonstrators and hundreds of people jailed for trying to escape through Poland Czechoslovakia and Hungary  It was indefensible to keep the latter in jail while thousands of others who had succeeded in escaping had been allowed out to the West he said 
PRAGUE Czechoslovakia has deported 400 East Germans who entered the country illegally over the past week to try to reach the West Reuter reports  The official Svobodnoe Slovo newspaper said 50 more East Germans were taking refuge in the West German embassy in Prague 
Their departure will be subject to bilateral negotiations between the GDR and West Germany it said  ALFRED MIODOWICZ the ex-Politburo member and Communist OPZZ trade union leader yesterday stood in the rain with 150 protesters outside the Sejm parliament in Warsaw 
His complaints against the economic policies of the new Solidarity-led government are much the same as those of Lech Walesa the Solidarity union leader  He talked of a tragic situation Mr Walesa more outspokenly of mounting popular anger and the danger of civil war 
At issue yesterday the Sejm deputies prudently decided to adjourn their debate until Monday as the first spoonful of the bitter economic medicine announced this week to restore a market economy in the swiftest possible way  In an attack on inflation heading for 1,000 per cent by year-end he government proposes to limit automatic wage indexation 
The formula involves 100 per cent indexation falling to 80 per cent minus increases already awarded  This means trying to claw back the pay rises extracted by workers since deregulation of food prices on 1 August butter has since then gone up 1,000 per cent meat by 700 per cent 
If we were to go for full indexation said Jacek Kuron the Labour Minister there would be a mountain of money on the market leading to enormous price increases with all the dangers that implies especially for the poor  Wage increases he said had often exceeded price increases 
Standing up for pensioners has rarely been popular except among pensioners  The OPZZ presented a petition to the Sejm demanding equal indexation for all 
It was backed by a group of mothers whom OPZZ leaders described as tearful  The small Democratic Party Solidarity 's coalition has already said it will not vote for the indexation plan 
What is peculiarly difficult for Solidarity is that as a trade union its power base is identical with that of the OPZZ namely the museums of Socialist gigantism from the Nowa Huta steelworks to the shipyards on the Baltic  According to finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz architect of the new economic plan between 10 and 20 per cent of the 7m-strong Polish workforce stand to lose their jobs through cutting inefficient industries as well as reducing the army and police 
PRAGUE An influential Czechoslovak economist whose criticisms of the country 's stagnation have achieved cult status returned from the Soviet Union to find his department dissolved and himself under threat of dismissal writes Edward Lucas  Milos Zeman in an article in the popular monthly Technicky Magazin directly attacked the country 's hardline Communist rulers for their refusal to accept change saying that their leadership had turned Czechoslovakia into a backward country 
He amplified his views in a broadcast on state television  Because his article appeared in an official magazine it could be legally photocopied and circulated and this with foreign radio broadcasts has made his critique even more widely known 
Mr Zeman a former member of the Communist Party said yesterday that he regarded the current leadership as anti-socialist counter-revolutionary and right-wing  Mr Zeman expects to become unemployed soon as a result of the sudden unexplained decision to close his forecasting department in the economics institute where he works but he denies that he is a martyr in the reformist cause 
The benefit is higher than the cost he said  My paper is known by practically all the adult population in Czechoslovakia 
Mr Zeman was sharply attacked in the official news media in the days following the publication of his views which he followed up with an article in the most important samizdat newspaper Lidove Noviny  In another move to silence criticism police on Thursday detained the paper 's editor Rudolf Zeman

The singer herself has made a fortune out of the insatiable popular curiosity to watch her perform leggy tall and unfailingly feminine with the controversial husk in her voice  Until 6 six years ago she was a man 
Since then after a series of well-publicised operations to the consternation of her fans among the fundamentalists she has been a woman Turkey 's first and most famous transsexual  Several times in the past there have been attempts to murder her 
Jagged bottles hurled at her in the dusk of an Istanbul night club injured but did not kill her  Early yesterday morning a 27-year-old Muslim radical tried again 
She had just started her act in the southern city of Adana when Haci Tepe a member of the Grey Wolves an extremist right-wing paramilitary group demanded she sing an old nationalist song  She refused and so he shot her 
Doctors say she may survive We were very surprised at the strength of her body after all the well you know what I mean said one  The gunman now in police custody is repentant 
He maintains he did not want to shoot her but that he was angry with her and was also agitated by a huge bar bill and as well as by being put in a particularly smokey corner of the night club  She ca n't die said the nightclub owner miserably 
She stands for so much  You see she is so Turkish

IN CADIZ a province of fighting bulls sherry vineyards and cork forests a strange electoral clash is shaping up between a man with the biggest mouth in Spanish politics and the Prime Minister 's wife  The mouth belongs to Pedro Pacheco the brash mayor of Jerez and a leader of the regional Andalucian Party which is challenging the ruling Socialists on their own territory 
His foe is Carmen Romero wife of the Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and perceived by most Spaniards as far more forthright and honest than her husband  The Socialists are so rattled by the prospect of losing at least three of the seven Cadiz parliamentary seats to Mr Pacheco that they coaxed Dona Carmen into leaving the Moncloa palace and joining the fray 
Mr Pacheco 's speciality is the crude insult  He has attacked the Spanish justice system as a crude farce and has insulted the pampered pop-star son of one of the wealthy sherry families which was accustomed to destroying any politician it pleased in Jerez 
Lately Mr Pacheco has gone further  He suggested the acid-tongued Deputy Premier Alfonso Guerra does humiliating and unprintable things with other men 
Half a century ago Mr Guerra a fellow Andalucian would have fought a duel over this remark but he is happy come the 29 October elections to crush Mr Pacheco 's party into the ash-white earth of Jerez  Apart from the insults and setting up a Formula I race-circuit in Jerez Mr Pacheco 's record of social change is unremarkable 
But many of the Andalucian farm workers who voted for the Socialists in 1982 and 1986 are turning to Mr Pacheco 's party to voice their discontent  Unemployment has risen in Cadiz province above 30 per cent nearly twice the national average 
Worse still the Socialists who campaigned to end amigismo in which the local mayor and his cronies hand out jobs and contracts to friends and families have embraced this custom with gusto  In Alcala de los Gazules a white village in the cork forests of Cadiz Manolo Jimenez an unemployed mason said You need a Socialist Party card to get work 
It also helps if you play good football  Our mayor is crazy about football 
We do n't have any factories or co-ops here in Alcala but we 've got a marvellous football field  It cost millions 
The mayor also gives jobs to people from other villages if they 're good football players  I 'm no good at football and I have n't had a steady job since last March he said glumly 
He belongs to the General Workers ' Union UGT which has quarrelled with the Socialist Party  Mrs Gonzalez wearing proletarian earrings made of screws and miniature spanners arrived in Alcala de los Gazules on Tuesday afternoon the second stop on the campaign 
Her speeches were so dull and rambling that her nervous advisers tried to stop newsmen from recording them  According to one columnist Carmen Rigalt her inexperience does not matter Carmen is the smile of the regime 
Not only is she pretty she has a reputation for being more of a Socialist than her husband and far more level-headed than he about the trappings of prime ministerial power  Spaniards respect her for keeping her schoolteacher 's job for as long as possible 
She refuses to be ornamental and will not go with her husband on state trips that do not interest her  She was also instrumental in nudging him into giving 25 per cent of the positions in the Socialist Party to women 
Mrs Gonzalez has also tried to mend the fratricidal split between her husband and Nicolas Redondo leader of the UGT union of which she is still a member  Women admire her 
At Alcala 's adult education centre one toothless old woman in slippers sang her a flamenco lament about a lovely but strong-headed girl from the next village who was stabbed seven times by her jealous husband  Did she have Mr Gonzalez in mind 
TAIF Saudi Arabia Lebanese members of parliament clutched at the threads of a peace plan yesterday after a brief period when agreement to end 14 years of civil war seemed within their grasp  But conflicting demands by Muslim and Christian deputies confounded an apparent breakthrough the previous day 
Sixty-two MPs equally divided between Christians and Muslims have been in this Saudi resort for the past two weeks examining a National Reconciliation Charter drafted by Arab League mediators as the basis for a permanent peace  It answers Muslim demands for more political power and offers the Christians promises that Syrian troops will pull out of western Lebanon within two years of the reforms taking place 
But although the deputies said they clinched an agreement on the charter on Thursday morning it began to collapse when Lebanese leaders including the Christian army commander Michel Aoun and the Druze leader Walid Jumblatt criticised it  More than 820 people have died in and around Beirut in battles between General Aoun 's forces and Syrian and Syrian-backed Muslim militias since mid-March after the general 's declaration of a war of liberation against the occupying Syrians 
An Arab League-sponsored ceasefire has been in force since 23 September  Muslim deputies here said they were optimistic that a working group of senior deputies could agree on the reforms which give the Muslims equal representation in parliament and transfer executive powers from the Christian president to a cabinet led by a Sunni Muslim prime minister 
THE HEADING is innocuous enough Executive Session 3 Reports of Special Committees presented by Joe Clarke the Foreign Minister of Canada with Kenneth Kaunda President of Zambia in the chair and Bob Hawke Prime Minister of Australia to speak  So reads the order of business for the Commonwealth Heads of Government at their meeting in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday 
But despite its bland style it hides a time bomb for Britain for the reports are on southern Africa  British officials say they believe this conference will not be obsessed with South Africa as previous meetings have been 
The election of FW de Klerk as president is a sign of progress they say and the imminent release of Walter Sisulu and the apparent movement towards negotiations are signs of a new atmosphere  Britain wants to encourage movement not to stifle it and any talk of sanctions would be bound to have a bad effect 
Yet even the British acknowledge that there are individuals and countries wedded to sanctions and according to Commonwealth officials Britain may well again find itself in a minority of one when the subject is debated  Many Commonwealth leaders believe the movement in South Africa is the result of pressure already applied and that only by turning the screw can the world be sure that there will be no turning back 
African leaders who recognise that it may be difficult to impose any further sanctions believe they have found the way forward  They want to see financial pressure applied to ensure South Africa can not roll over its debt or raise new capital 
Britain argues this would result in an impoverished country prey to all the economic ills which have beset other African states  Whatever the discussion 's outcome Margaret Thatcher will not yield so that the Commonwealth may again be forced to take decisions from which Britain will dissent 
Attending her seventh meeting of this odd club the British Prime Minister is unlikely to shrink from going it alone  Britain is looking for something new from this conference 
The environment the battle against drugs and measures to combat terrorism will be high on the agenda if the British have their way  Yet even here there are minefields for the report of a group of Commonwealth experts is likely to be the basis for the discussion on the environment and its main recommendation is that the developed countries should foot the bill for the under-developed to adopt environment-friendly means of production 
SIX OF the long-term political prisoners whose release the government announced this week including Walter Sisulu the former ANC secretary were flown up from Cape Town to Johannesburg under guard yesterday morning and transferred to Diepkloof prison in Soweto according to the South African Press Association  They were expected finally to be freed either late last night or more likely this weekend 
Amid much rumour and mystery the consequence of a complete news black-out by the authorities on the circumstances of the pending releases it was not possible to obtain independent confirmation of the report  The authorities showed less reticence in dealing with a group of black youths who gathered outside the Sisulu home in Soweto yesterday evening to sing and dance in celebration of the ANC leader 's imminent freedom 
Two lorries crammed with riot policemen arrived and fired tear-gas canisters rapidly dispersing the small crowd which included news photographers  A seven-year-old child was reportedly hit by one of the canisters and taken injured in the leg to hospital 
The incident appeared likely to diminish the chances of the prisoners being freed last night  Piling on the confusion Ramish Vassen a Cape Town lawyer representing three of the prisoners said he went yesterday to Pollsmoor prison where they have been kept in recent years to deliver a suit for one of his clients Elias Motosaledi 
He did not see any of the prisoners but was led to believe they were still inside  One of the prison warders he said had asked him if he knew when the men were to be released 
Reporters spent the day scurrying around in far from dignified fashion but not even the foreign television networks with the vast logistical operations they run were able to establish any sightings or obtain any hard information  Why the authorities were being so apparently perverse it was possible only to speculate 
One line of thought was that the government wished to dampen as far as possible the spirits of anti-apartheid demonstrators who are planning marches all over the country today in celebration of the releases which have been proclaimed a great victory for the people  One happy participant in the march planned in Johannesburg will be Mr Sisulu 's wife Albertina who in the one thankfully concrete news development of the day had her restriction orders lifted by the police yesterday morning 
She had been restricted on account of her political activities as co-president of the United Democratic Front UDF from leaving her house at night from taking part in public meetings and from making public statements of any kind  This is wonderful Mrs Sisulu said 
The whole time since I heard that Walter would be released unconditionally I have been wondering how things will work with him being allowed out at night and to talk to whoever he wishes and me sitting at home in the evenings gagged  Mrs Sisulu had a short meeting at her home yesterday with Winnie Mandela who said afterwards that her husband Nelson Mandela would not be freed this year 
He would refuse to be released into a South Africa where the ANC is banned she said  He would also not leave jail into the state of emergency 
THE African National Congress has warned against false optimism over South Africa created by the new presidency of FW de Klerk and his decision to release key political prisoners  Thabo Mbeki the ANC foreign affairs spokesman said in London yesterday FW de Klerk has decided to shift the defensive line on which PW Botha stood 
He is shifting the defensive line without changing the central objective  Mr Mbeki said the importance of recent victories should be recognised but Mr de Klerk had no choice but to make concessions 
FW de Klerk and the National Party went to the electorate on an apartheid platform which was very clearly and consistently stated  He said Mr de Klerk wanted to produce a race federation and co-opt the ANC and Nelson Mandela to legitimise it 
Reiterating the ANC 's willingness to negotiate with the South African government he said the time was not right for the ANC to abandon violence The struggle inside South Africa and outside South Africa must continue  Mr Mbeki was speaking at a meeting of the South Africa Coalition a broad grouping of British organisations trying to change British policy over South Africa 
In this country you are faced with a stubborn and self-assured lady who sees it as one of her tasks to protect the regime Mr Mbeki said  PRESIDENT George Bush as much as admitted yesterday that he is in a political bind over the abortion issue 
As a pro-abortion mood sweeps the country he may have to modify his stance  Gains made this week by abortion-rights groups in the Florida legislature in governors ' races in New Jersey and Virginia and in the House of Representatives have weighted the balance markedly toward the pro-abortion forces 
The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would provide abortion funds for poor women who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest funding which Mr Bush is against  But the measure seems likely to pass Congress 
If Mr Bush vetoes the measure he risks losing abortion-rights voters who supported him for other reasons and if he changes his firm anti-abortion stance he runs the potentially greater risk of losing his hard-core right-wing support  At a press conference yesterday he was asked whether he is willing to negotiate or accept a compromise on the House measure 
He admitted he wanted to see if there was room for flexible language in the bill which may be able to avoid a veto on my part  The Democratic leadership in Congress has pushed him hard on the issue 
The House Speaker Tom Foley and the Senate majority leader George Mitchell have urged him to reconsider his stance even though they concede they do not have the votes to override a veto  In a joint statement they said Mr Bush holds it in his power to deny the right of choice to the poorest most vulnerable American women 
THE Justice Department admitted yesterday that it had granted the FBI authority to override international law in order to seize fugitives from US justice living abroad without first obtaining the consent of the country where they were sheltering  Responding to a report in the Los Angeles Times yesterday Justice Department officials confirmed that the policy had been in place since 21 June 
It could have important implications for American efforts to arrest drug dealers terrorists and the Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega for prosecution in the US  Within the administration the new line is reportedly known as the President 's snatch policy 
A legal opinion requested by the Attorney-General Richard Thornburgh effected the change in June but it had been kept secret since then  According to the Los Angeles Times the opinion is entitled Authority of the FBI to override customary or other international law in the course of extra-territorial law-enforcement activities 
Justice Department officials declined to discuss the precise content of the opinion or the rationale behind it  A former Justice Department prosecutor Lawrence Barcella said that the policy risked offending otherwise friendly countries which might even bring kidnapping charges against the FBI 
The snatch policy overturns a Carter administration edict to which it is diametrically opposed  When the FBI then proposed to kidnap a fugitive US financier Robert Vesco from the Bahamas the Justice Department produced a legal opinion blocking the plan 
The opinion stated US agents have no law-enforcement authority in another nation unless it is the product of that nation 's consent in the current international climate this country can ill afford an operation that would permit others to argue that the United States does not respect international law  Since 1984 the Justice Department has had authority to prosecute terrorists who attack Americans abroad but the FBI has had to request permission from the host countries to return them to the US 
Only one terrorist Fawaz Yunis has been arrested under the 1984 law and the FBI lured him into international waters to make the arrest  There was speculation yesterday that the new policy was tailored for the Noriega case 
The ruling would appear to permit the FBI to go into Panama and kidnap General Noriega but when reporters asked President Bush yesterday morning if that was the case he said I 'm embarrassed to say I do n't know what the answer is  JONAS SAVIMBI the Unita leader was pressed yesterday to abide by the letter and spirit of the agreement reached in June with the Angolan government which should have ended fighting in that country writes John Bulloch 
John Major the Foreign Secretary said the withdrawal of the Cubans from Angola and the Namibian settlement were an opportunity to end the fighting  The Blackpool meeting was the first between Mr Savimbi and a British minister underlining the importance Britain attaches to persuading Mr Savimbi to return to the conference table 
The Unita leader indicated that he was ready to do so and suggested a meeting in Libreville within the next month  Mr Savimbi is meeting President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire in Paris on Monday and yesterday the Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem hurried there to put his side of the argument to the Zairean mediator 
Officials say it is because the two sides have different versions of what was decided at the previous negotiations that the ceasefire has broken down  Angola wants Mr Savimbi to go into voluntary exile while elections are held perhaps to return later but his supporters say there was no such agreement 
It seemed yesterday that the conflicting ideas would be sorted out by President Mobutu and that a political settlement was in sight  One indication of that was that at the request of the British both sides agreed to stop the radio propaganda campaigns they have been waging against each other 
THE 24 HOURS preceding President George Bush 's stop in New York last night on behalf of Rudolph Giuliani the Republican candidate for mayor were among the bloodiest the city has seen  For Mr Giuliani however for whom crime is a main campaign theme the night in which 11 people were killed did little to boost his chances of winning next month 's election 
As he has been discovering the issues which excite New Yorkers are not rising levels of crime poverty and the deteriorating quality of life  Yesterday 's newspapers were consumed not with Mr Bush 's campaign stop for Mr Giuliani but with the position of David Dinkins the Democratic candidate on security for the state of Israel and Woody Allen 's defence of the comedian Jackie Mason 
Mr Allen said Mr Mason was joking when he called Mr Dinkins a fancy schvartze with a moustache and that Jews would only vote for him out of guilt  Yesterday 's newspaper columns on the election were devoted to Mr Dinkins ' promises to defend Jewish interests in the same way that Mayor Ed Koch did for the past 12 years 
In a front-page headline the New York Post proclaimed Woody Allen Backs Jackie Mason  Mr Allen was tactless enough to offer his opinion while standing beside Mr Dinkins 
The coverage given to Mr Allen 's remarks must have been particularly galling to Mr Giuliani 's backers in the Republican party who have been unable to make crime an issue in the race  Last year Mr Bush came from 17 points behind at the polls when a skilful advertising campaign persuaded voters that Michael Dukakis the Liberal governor of Massachusetts was soft on crime 
More people than ever are leaving New York before they get killed raped or mugged  There were 1,019 murders in the first seven months of 1989 1 per cent below the same period last year which eventually reached a record 1,896 
Still the Giuliani campaign theme of crime crack and corruption is apparently failing to ignite voter interest  Mr Bush described Mr Giuliani as America 's greatest crime fighter and the evidence of the anarchy on the streets was on the television news for all to see 
On Wednesday night a 52-year-old Baptist minister was shot dead by robbers in the vestibule of his Bedford Stuyvesant church  Six blocks away a 52-year-old doorman who tried to protect himself with an ice pick was killed by a teenager with an automatic handgun 
In Times Square an off-duty law enforcement officer felt a knife against his throat as he went to catch a train home at 11.15pm  The mugger who probably thought he was accosting a tourist said do n't move 
The agent pulled out a gun and shot him dead  Mr Giuliani has been unable to focus voters ' attention on the fact that Mr Dinkins once went several years without paying his taxes or that he is a product of a corrupt Democratic machine 
Mr Dinkins has stayed in the headlines by pandering to Jewish sensibilities and by removing from his campaign a volunteer who once read an antisemitic poem on the radio and praised it  SPECIAL EVENTS

LAST WORDS  Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm 
Ralph Waldo Emerson  Those old Andy Hardy movies always seemed to have a scene where a bunch of American teenagers would be sitting around in an old barn or something wondering where to stage their amateur dramatics 
Suddenly one would leap onto a bale of hay and exclaim I know kids why do n't we do the show right here  There would be a couple of quick scenes of frenzied activity and then they would cut to a grand finale of Mickey Rooney & Co singing and dancing their way across a barn miraculously transformed into a splendid stage 
This is the kind of dreamy Hollywood fantasy I like to float in when I 'm lying flat on my back under some dirty platform desperately trying to tack a loose wire or stubborn piece of baize into position or standing in a wet field trying to work out exactly how the VIPs will swim through the mud from the helicopter to the marquee  No event just happens it 's got to be created 
Whether it is a school fÃªte or a huge rally a successful event is the result of clear objectives imagination planning an overall view and attention to countless details  This part of the book will give you an expert and simple guide to planning and staging such events 
It 's based on my experience of presenting thousands of them in close to a hundred countries around the world under a wide variety of conditions  I shall be talking mainly about conferences because they are the most common 
There are more than 200,000 a year in the United Kingdom alone  You can go into any reasonable size hotel some days and find two or three events on simultaneously 
It is increasingly likely that anyone who takes an active role in any organisation will at some point find themselves involved in setting up a special event  Most of the principles and practicalities we shall be discussing for conferences apply to other events too but where there are special considerations and differences for say rallies or exhibitions I will mention them 
The key elements are imagination planning foresight thoroughness and a never-ending willingness to go that extra mile in dealing with people and details  These are as essential when you 're planning a company training seminar with twenty-five people as they are when you 're organising an 8,000 delegate fifty-nation ten-day congress 
First of all you must have clear goals a picture in your mind of how you see the end result and a plan to monitor your progress and results  It 's no good going to work on the details unless you have this vision 
It would be like taking London 's M25 or Washington 's beltway in the hope of getting somewhere all you would do is go round and round in circles  You have to know where you 're going if you are to plan the best way of getting there 
Before you start ask yourself what are our objectives what message are we trying to get across which people do we want to reach what emotions should they feel what responses are we looking for what do we want them to take from this event in person or through the media and press  A conference may for instance be held to communicate policy as the Conservative Party 's is or to decide policy as in Labour 's case 
You may wish to inform a specialist group of people or give them a reward or an incentive  An exhibition may be aimed at creating new marketing ideas or providing an arena for marketing 
A rally may be aimed at exciting motivating or converting people and so on  Only when you know what you want to achieve can you plan how you are going to achieve it 
The goal dictates the form  The goal dictates the form 
It was frustrating at the Brighton Conservative Party Conference in 1988 to find entrepreneurs selling Union Jacks on the afternoon of Mrs Thatcher 's address  It was the wrong occasion the amateur just likes flags and razzamatazz but the professional creates the atmosphere to suit the occasion 
This was a mid-term party conference not a general election rally  In America they ask What do we want to achieve and then How do we achieve it 
In England we say What shall we do and then I wonder if it will achieve anything  No wonder we win so few gold medals or cups 
In America the political conventions are designed to enthuse the participants and television viewers to go out and campaign for their candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency  Because that is the aim razzamatazz music flags balloons streamers and placards are appropriate means to help achieve it 
I remember during the Republican National Convention in Dallas in 1984 walking through the floor as the renomination of President Reagan was being acclaimed  Thousands of flags were waving helium balloons were going up and air balloons were coming down two separate bands at both ends of the huge auditorium were playing different songs and everyone was cheering and screaming their heads off 
I was walking quietly by one group of people when a delightful black girl saw me passing and in the nicest way possible flung her arms around my neck and said Is n't America wonderful  The magic had certainly worked for her 
In 1985 there was a double objective for a rally I did with Ernie Guy for the American Bar Association in the Royal Albert Hall  Although it was a major political speech by the Prime Minister it was quite appropriate to have a military band and flags and a bit of excitement 
The Americans expected it and so it prepared them to sit down quietly and listen to speech  On the other hand most of the political and commercial conferences that I do are either for presentation on television of important policies or for discussion and debate on serious issues 
In such cases too many frills and too much frivolity would be all wrong  The professional plans the presentation to suit the message and achieve the objective not to put on a good show 
Once you have a clear idea of what you have to do the next thing is to work out how you pay for it  There 's something of the chicken and egg situation in this 
It 's hard to decide what you can do if you do n't know how much money you can get and it 's hard to decide what something will cost if you have n't a clear idea of what you want to do  Sort this out at your first planning meeting and much will depend on the particular circumstances of your organisation 
It may have unlimited funds or it may have very tight ones most fall somewhere in between so you have to think creatively about raising the additional finance to do the job properly  There are several things to remember about finance 
One is that the bigger the event up to about 3,000 people the more it costs proportionally  It is not simply a question of multiplying numbers 
For instance you may find that a conference for seventy people in a smallish London hotel will work out at Â£30 a head per day  But if you 're doing something for 7,000 the costs will be more per person per day 
That 's because large events involve extra considerations you never dreamed of when doing a small conference  If you 're hiring Earls Court for example most people in the audience probably would not even be able to see the speakers let alone hear them 
So you 're talking about setting up giant screens and elaborate video and sound systems  Another important point is that the less time you have in which to do something the more it costs because you start to run into things like overtime and special delivery payments rush jobs and so on 
In 1979 we held the United Kingdom 's first showbiz-style election rally for Mrs Thatcher and it was a great success  A few days later Lord Thorneycroft the Party Chairman and Alastair now Lord McAlpine came to me and asked if we could stage another for the European Elections three weeks later 
We had spent nine months working on the first one  When I had got my breath back I said Yes we can but it will cost three times as much and the Party will have to be responsible for getting people to come to it 
The most difficult part of any conference is getting the right number of the right people to attend  We set to work and produced the rally and it was terrific 
It showed you can achieve something at short notice provided you 're prepared to drop everything and cover the cost  Petula Clark sang and political agents wept with emotion 
Such occasions however have to be very special  No-one can operate like that consistently nor should it be necessary 
For any event involving more than two hundred people a year 's planning is just about enough for any event involving fewer people six months is the absolute minimum  Work out your initial budget for every possible item of expenditure and then pad it 
Be as precise and as far-seeing as possible  Many people spend money chronologically rather than strategically with the result that they run out before they 've done everything 
A little foresight might have shown them that spending less on early hospitality and a bit more on the venue would have saved them time money and trouble overall  Similarly it 's no good discovering that you are going to need an autocue and a slide projector when there 's no money left to buy or hire them or that your guest speaker will only fly first class when you 've allocated Â£200 in your budget for his travel costs because someone vaguely remembered that Â£200 was the Apex fare 
When you 're inviting speakers discover what their real needs are going to be  It 's not unknown for an American to want to show a dozen video tapes each of which may cost Â£50 to transfer to the British system 
Plan your expenditure for each stage  For instance site recces 
I make it a rule to go at least three times  Allow for such visits and the travel and accommodation costs they entail 
If you 're borrowing money for the event be it Â£200 or Â£20,000 include the interest payments as part of your expenditure budget  Insure against everything from salmonella poisoning to a speaker 's non-appearance and keep finances for a particular event separate from the company or organisation 's general finances 
Once you 've drawn up this highly detailed and incredibly efficient list pad it  Pad every section by ten per cent at least 
The smaller the overall budget the more you pad to give yourself room for manoeuvre  I 'd recommend padding a budget of under Â£1,000 by at least fifty per cent 
And after you 've done all the item padding allow another fifteen per cent for contingencies  The odds are that you will have to dip into it but if you do n't and you come in under budget everyone else will be enormously impressed by your professionalism 
Many events will in fact generate an income to offset some of the expense perhaps a registration fee a commercial exhibition or sales of souvenirs  The point is to be specific about income and to plan it to meet your maximum budget 
It always strikes me as odd that we are incredibly specific in our lives about the small things ordering a sandwich for instance we order type of bread filling relish seasonings and extras  But when it comes to big things like religion politics and money we all too often just vaguely hope that we 'll get by 
Do n't muddle through when you 're planning an event  Do n't say Oh if we have a wine and cheese party it 'll bring something in when you need to be sure of raising Â£300 
Nor is it any good hoping you 'll raise all the money at the conference itself if three-quarters of the bills have to be paid beforehand  You have to make things happen not let them get mentioned discussed and then forgotten 
Who actually does what will depend on the nature of your organisation whether for instance it is part of a professional set-up drawing on different departments resources and personnel within a company or whether it is purely voluntary or a mixture of both  In any conference or special event there are certain essentials 
You must have a co-ordinator who liaises between the different people takes the overall view is good at detail and is ultimately the person with whom the buck stops  Find a secretary and some key workers depending on your needs 
You should also have a treasurer or accountant to supervise the spending of the money and a finance chairman to raise it  These two functions ought to be separate 
The accountant can not be worrying about money coming in  He needs to have time and freedom to concentrate on proper spending 
For bigger events you may also need someone to look after travel and accommodation the programme publicity and most important a person responsible for getting the right people to enrol always the most difficult single task  These are a few suggestions 
Your event will have its own needs and the composition of the committee may be suggested accordingly  Committee 
Now there 's a word to chill the blood  If Moses had been a committee the Children of Israel would still be in Egypt 
But you need a body that can get together at various stages to liaise and swap ideas but whose members can function in their independent tasks  I have included here a planning chart for small conferences which has served as a basis for hundreds of other charts I 've used over the years 
You can adapt it for your own taste but keep the pointers in mind  Once you 've had your initial meeting drawn up your central strategy and agreed your budget individuals should be allowed to get on with their jobs with a reasonable amount of flexibility 
Do n't put yourself in a situation where the treasurer has to come back to the committee to argue over every last penny  To take a simple illustration 
If it 's been agreed that the treasurer spends Â£300 on publicity with Â£100 each for posters leaflets and newspaper advertisements he should be allowed the latitude to spend Â£150 on newspaper ads and Â£150 on leaflets if the publicity chairman thinks it necessary and perhaps nothing on posters  Do n't schedule too many meetings 
The trouble is organisers love 'em  One of my bigger irritations is when I have an enormously tight schedule taking me all over the country and I get calls sometimes on my mobile phone when I 'm stuck in the middle of a field somewhere insisting that it 's vitally important I attend a meeting that has just been scheduled for three o'clock that afternoon in London which could easily have been planned at least two weeks earlier 
When you 're drawing up the timetable right at the beginning there is no reason why you can not fix your planning meeting dates and stick pretty closely to them  There are rare occasions when emergency meetings are necessary but such crises are nearly always avoidable if people are working well and the schedule has been properly organised 
I had to hold some emergency meetings once during the preparations for Billy Graham 's Euro 70 Crusade at Dortmund in 1970  Billy was suddenly taken quite ill and all our closed circuit television centres around Europe had to be briefed quickly and in person 
I scheduled airport meetings in fourteen of the thirty-six centres and travelled to seven on each of two days  The first day it was Kristiansand Oslo Copenhagen Hamburg Amsterdam London and Brussels 
Late at night I drove to Germany and the next day met committees in Frankfurt Paris Geneva Zegreb Graz Munich and Vienna  Most of the trip was on scheduled flights all exactly on time 
Of course you do need to monitor people once they have been given their tasks  You ca n't just go away and hope everything will fall into place 
I was once involved in setting up ten Crusades simultaneously in Australia and New Zealand for Billy Graham  They were about 3,500 miles apart and I was visiting each one at least once a month for a year 
That meant I was travelling a route that stretched from Darwin in northern Australia to Invercargill in southern New Zealand  At one team meeting Billy asked me if all the travelling and the time and money it took were really necessary 
I told him it was and he said fine  Nearly two years later he told me that in each of those ten Crusades people on the committees had said that although everyone had agreed on certain tasks to be done they only actually got cracking on them a couple of days before I was due back 
That kind of effort is worthwhile because it motivates and energises workers  There is no substitute for personal contact in this work 
If you are an event co-ordinator giving your personal direction passing on your commitment and gut-level conviction is vital  If an organiser does not co-ordinate and monitor and know exactly what 's going on at each stage then ultimately he has only himself to blame if something goes wrong 
You can never plan too much never work out too many details or anticipate too many worst cases  It helps you understand other people 's tasks avoid problems and keep in mind that crucial overview I spoke of earlier 
Perhaps this is the point at which to mention an event 's atmosphere its charisma its personality if you like  It 's a hard thing to talk about and difficult to define but it is that essence that makes an event special different from the rest even from similar occasions in other years 
Sometimes it happens spontaneously  At other times you have to create it perhaps by one imaginative stroke perhaps by hundreds of tiny details programme decoration colour scheme logos motifs slogans guests music menus and so on 
FIRST NIGHT Planning the huge Billy Graham Crusades of the sixties and seventies meant starting from scratch and moving into a city or country six to eighteen months ahead  The first night was always a little tense and emotional as we saw hundreds come forward at the end of the service to commit their lives to Christ 
I would usually be at the foot of the platform stairs as Billy went on at the start  Behind him was the vice-president of the organisation Walter Smyth 
All of us in the team knew that we were totally dependent on the Lord for any success but it was still reassuring at each crusade when Walter would murmur to me as he surveyed the huge first night crowds Well Harvey that 's your job safe till the next one  At the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton in 1988 we had a little fun on the last day just before the Prime Minister 's speech 
The audience was sitting waiting about forty-five minutes before the start  I asked our organist Douglas Reeves to switch to the rhythmic sing-along songs 
People began to clap and wave flags  I turned our closed circuit cameras onto the flag-wavers and they appeared on the huge screens above the stage 
As the audience saw themselves on screen they began to perform for the cameras and within minutes the whole audience was cheering singing and even dancing in the aisles  In two minutes we had created the excitement fun and audience involvement that set the atmosphere for the afternoon 
When the Prime Minister came to speak we had quietened it down so that they were ready to listen  Object achieved 
If you agree on the details and choose a theme you can then weave them into your planning at every stage  When you are compiling a flow-chart work backwards 
For example you want to produce some leaflets about an event that is happening on July 21  You need time for the leaflets to be effective maybe three weeks 
You allow a week to ten days to distribute them so they have to be ready on June 15  Allowing for running and folding time proof correction author 's corrections design and scripting it soon becomes clear that by early-May you must be sitting down to plan the details of those leaflets no later 
It would be useless to start compiling the leaflets at the beginning of July but that 's what often happens  This is just one example 
Apply the same countdown procedure to other elements and over-estimate how long things will take rather than under-estimate  That way you can only be pleasantly surprised occasionally 
A flow chart compared with a calendar will also tell you if your event clashes with a race meeting in the area on that day or another big event that might clog the roads take the public attention and jeopardise the success of yours  As new ideas come up during preparations the chart will help you assess their potential within the overall strategy 
You should also work into it check lists for each month with every detail you can think of and have an arrangement for assessing the event after it has happened  This is important if you are to learn whether you have achieved your objectives and what should have been handled differently 
The Billy Graham Crusades for example include planning for the following-up of converts through local churches as part of their very early advance meetings  The flow chart is not supposed to be rigid or to be adhered to at all costs more a source of guidance and reference and a way of keeping check on the different activities that go on simultaneously as you move towards that special day 
People are always niggling me and teasing me for doing too much work going into too many details for even the smallest conference  But these same people always say That ran like clockwork Harvey or What a great do that was it looked terrific and so on 
They just do n't make the connection  Some people say you get tired and jaded with something if you plan too much or for too long 
Wrong  Not with good strategic planning 
Good planning gives you thinking time the chance to anticipate problems and find ways of avoiding those stresses and crises that arise because you have n't enough time to deal with the unexpected  There are very few problems that can not be overcome 
The main reason they are not overcome is lack of time to discover the mistake and put it right  It 's a principle that applies to even the most straightforward things like travel 
It takes me half an hour to get from my home in North London to Heathrow Airport via the M25  That 's on a good day 
On a day of heavy traffic it could take an hour  I always leave a minimum of one and a half hours so that if I have a blow-out or breakdown or some other unforeseen emergency I still have time to take care of it and catch the plane 
The result of this strategy is that I 've never missed a plane in twenty-eight years of international travel except once  That was in Frankfurt when a meeting over which I had no control went on just too long and I had no chance of making my flight 
I caught the next one and as we arrived at Geneva we were told the flight before the one I should have been on had been blown up by a terrorist bomb  It was one of the first attacks and everyone on board had been killed 
Much of the travelling I have done has been advancing the vital part of effective event planning  It can be a long and weary job especially if you 've got more than one location but there is no way to plan a conference exhibition rally or any other special event without proper advancing 
Colleagues in politics and commerce still belittle my commitment to advance work  Surely you do n't have to go there again they say or Do you really need to take your assistant there before the start 
Yes yes and yes again  There is simply no substitute for knowing your venue and how to get there thoroughly 
There is no other way of anticipating the potential and the problems or getting to know the local people you will need to solve them  At one venue we were having two conferences three months apart 
Because the first one was quite small I did not give it the full advance treatment that I usually do  I lived to regret it 
We had crowd-flow blockages insufficient refreshment facilities no VIP entrance no security check until people were in the main auditorium and no way to get backstage except by walking right through the main meeting up the stairs onto the stage and out through the back with everybody watching  It caused us a lot of extra work major changes and more travel to get it right for the second larger meeting 
FROM THE LONGMAN REGISTER OF NEW WORDS advance man noun someone who makes arrangements for visits and appearances by an eminent person and goes in advance to ensure that they proceed smoothly  Officially Mr Thomas is director of presentations for the Conservative party unofficially he is the Prime Minister 's personal advance man as the current phrase goes 
This is the year of the advance man  And when people say advance man they usually mean Harvey Thomas 
Daily Telegraph 4 June 1987 * A word of US origin  Thorough advancing is the heartfelt belief of a man who has worked in ninety-seven different countries 
And travelled all the way round the world thirteen times  The military rightly say Time spent on reconnaissance is never wasted 
On my first visit to a venue I take photographs get hold of the plans make extensive notes and there will still be a hundred things I 'll miss  Like the fact that the plugs are the wrong size or the electrical system is completely inadequate or in the case of the Brighton Centre in 1988 that there are many different ceiling heights in the exhibition area 
If you do n't see and feel each event venue for yourself you will not get the maximum potential out of it  I would like to see the advance man or woman used to much greater effect in this country 
The Americans do it better  He should be brought in at the earliest stages to advise on venues which would save time money and frustration 
He should be the link between the professionals at head office and the local knowledge of the on-the-spot workers  He should have a say in how the guest speakers use their time at the event should they meet the press or the mayor where can they go for a bit of peace and quiet even reassurance and so on 
The advance man will even be the person best qualified from having sussed the location to advise on menus rehearsals and many other crucial details  In so many areas the advance man who may or may not be the same as the event organiser has the on-the-spot knowledge which headquarters staff or the committee can never have and it 's a mistake not to get the maximum use from it 
The advance man knows the way to get VIPs in and out of the hall and how to manage their entrances and exits to the best effect  He also knows if a particular route will need clearing of cables furniture and other obstacles 
Ignorance of and unwillingness to accept the need for a good advance man causes more problems in event presentation than anything else  Another of his tasks might be the gathering of voluntarily offered resources at the venue whether it 's free baize for the tables at a church fÃªte free mineral water or food from a local business or the offer of cars to transport guests 
The good advance man develops through experience the wisdom of knowing when to try something and when not  He has a sixth sense to recognise the genuine from the phoney 
I was the advance man for Mrs Thatcher in the 1987 General Election  When I arrived ten minutes before her at one stop advance means a few minutes ahead as well as two months I found that two ladies in wheelchairs had positioned themselves at the foot of the stairs and were pleading with everyone to let them stay and shake hands with Mrs Thatcher 
Officials were trying to move them but after a word with our security people we allowed them to stay  It was a photo-opportunity for everyone but only because they genuinely wanted to be there and to have their picture taken 
That is the kind of occasion on which the advance man has to think fast make a decision and manage it through  Something that he has to accept however is that there will be many too many occasions when great chunks of research or preparation are never used 
You can spend an enormous amount of time checking out the possibilities for a particular audio-visual presentation only to find the organiser or speaker changes his mind  It 's an occupational hazard 
In the Billy Graham team we had a saying But that was yesterday  In the political world it 's often But that was an hour ago

As the cow said to the Maine farmer Thank you for a warm hand on a cold morning  John F. Kennedy Speech in Los Angeles 1960 
The overview of the situation comes first  When I was working in Australia I went swimming with some missionary friends near Darwin 
We drove for miles through dense jungle and eventually came to a big pool which was maybe 150 metres square and 30 metres deep  I was a bit dubious at first but I was hot and sticky and the water looked tempting 
My friends and their little daughter went splashing blithely in so I threw caution to the winds and followed  We had a nice swim for half an hour or so 
As I climbed out I felt something tickling my toes  I looked down and saw a giant freshwater prawn almost a foot long 
For someone used to the tiny creatures we get in England it was something of a shock and I said as much as I leapt into the air  Oh that 's nothing they said 
This pool is filled with freshwater crocodiles and water pythons but they do n't bother us so we did n't tell you  I said If you 'd told me that while I was in the pool you 'd have seen another miracle walking on the water 
When you understand the whole picture your attitude towards it changes radically  I had n't come to any grief by not having a comprehensive view of that crocodile pool ignorance really was bliss that day but when it comes to organizing a major event failure to see the overall picture from the start can blight the whole business 
It is certainly crucial when it comes to choosing your venue  We 'll be talking about the important practical details you have to grapple with when making your selection but the first and last point is always the overall view of the project and objectives 
Why are we doing all this  What do we want to achieve 
If you lose sight of that all the attention to detail in the world is not a great deal of use  In Chapter Four I set Out some of the reasons why conferences and other big events are held 
I want to mention one here  It 's often Overlooked but it is probably the single most beneficial part having a good time 
Now I 'm not talking about a loud wild time or a side-splitting back-slapping drunken knees-up  I mean what the Bible calls the fellowshipping of yourselves together 
People want to enjoy the company of like-minded fellows  They like to renew old acquaintances make new friends see an interesting place in good company recharge their batteries 
They want to be interested and happy  But conference organisers and participants often feel guilty about this aspect 
They are nagged by the feeling that it 's wrong to mix pleasure with business  Business should be pleasure and politics should be fun 
That 's realistic not frivolous  Nothing makes an impact in communication like enthusiastic personal contact 
That 's why we have conferences and rallies and congresses and debates and shows and exhibitions  Because they bring people together 
Otherwise we might as well all stay at home and stare at computer terminals  Mark you if the atmosphere at the venue is good you can expand the outreach of your message a thousand times by television broadcast or closed circuit television relays to other venues 
Look at the Last Night of the Proms from the Albert Hall the whole country joins in  And the Wimbledon Final too 
And if the nation is in need of a quiet sleep we can all tune into cricket  So when you 're picking the venue remember that atmosphere will play a big part in your success 
It will influence the reaction to the presentation and memories of it  Some halls not only have no personality but no potential for creating any 
You learn to recognise them through experience it 's often an indefinable something that 's lacking  More specifically it may be the acoustics or the positioning of the seats or the stage or it may be the coldness of cement walls or the seediness of crumbling old ones 
The Bournemouth International Centre is an example of a place that lacks personality  The staff are great but like many venues around the world it was built for the architect 's vision not for practical multi-purpose use into the twenty-first century 
The stage is tucked away like a box in the wall  There 's no space over the top of it to fly anything 
An audience can only sit at the front of the stage and the hall stretches back for miles  There 's nothing around the sides of the stage except cold brick walls and if you put anything there you cut down the already poor sight lines even more 
If they had accepted good professional presentation advice they could have saved thousands had a marvellous multi-purpose centre proper crowd flow and huge potential for the next decade  I wonder why the right people are so rarely asked to help until it 's too late 
Having said all that there is usually something you can do to redeem a place  The Bournemouth International Centre is not really extensive or flexible enough for a modern Conservative Party Conference 
However because the management were helpful and co-operative we were able to make a few adjustments  We drained the swimming pool and turned the surrounds into a huge light warm press area 
We converted the kitchen into a production centre and extended the stage by three metres to make the sight lines passable and give us reasonable presentational potential  DISTRACTED Avoid venues with distracting views outside the windows or pull the curtains 
I once had a half-day seminar in a conference room on the top floor of Chicago 's O'Hare Hilton overlooking the O'Hare Airport runways which crossed each other  By the end of the afternoon I was a nervous wreck 
Chicago had the busiest airport in the world  Every few seconds a plane would take off as another approached the cross runway with a third coming in behind the take-off plane to land 
How they made it safely I will never know  I never did find out what the seminar was about 
It is always easier to create in a cavern than concoct in a corner  If you have height and space you can do anything 
Mrs Thatcher held her first rally for the European Elections at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham Hall 6  It is a great barn of a place which seats 5,000 but which that day was due to hold 2,500 
So we had to shrink the hall  We put up 6m muffle boards two-thirds of the way back erected a four-row tiered seating block in front of them and built a 24m by 11m stage at the front 
We flew huge flags and posters one metre in from the side walls reaching to some two metres above the ground  A big backdrop to the stage with light concentrated on it did the rest 
We even had space for a refreshment area behind the muffle boards at the back of the hall  A powerful organ added the final touches with lively and popular European music 
The fact that Hall 6 is a bare cavern with iron girders did n't matter at all by the time we had finished  We had created a colourful well-lit attractive atmospheric setting out of virtually nothing 
For a bigger event it is always better to go for an empty room that allows you scope to do your own thing rather than a place which has limiting fixed features  That 's why for instance it 's easier to produce a big conference at the Brighton Conference Centre where there is almost austere simplicity than it is in Blackpool 's charming but inflexible Winter Gardens 
The atmosphere we create is different but not better or worse in either Brighton or Blackpool  One of the best major centres I have worked or seen is the International Congress Centre in Berlin which has two auditoria with a stage in the middle 
This arrangement is so flexible it can be used for anything from tennis to Holiday on Ice to huge international congresses and exhibitions  Your venue provides the actual meeting room or hall and all your ancillary needs food exhibitions office space etc 
Let me for a moment concentrate on the meeting room alone  Although you can shrink a hall by various techniques it is not ideal 
What you want is a location that is always comfortably filled  This is the rule for bigger conferences two hundred people or more because these are more the show conferences 
If you are going to reach people through the media never have many empty seats  It looks bad 
Have the place filled and a few people standing  This needs careful organising 
On the last afternoon are many people leaving  Then move some chairs out and spread the others 
Before you confirm a venue plan your strategy for seat occupation in the main hall  At the CBI Initiative 1992 Press Launch in October 1988 we used the Methven Room at Centre Point in London 
There were 220 chairs  The CBI team estimated a total attendance of 120 they were exactly right 
A hundred chairs disappeared the rows became a little more spacious aisles were one seat wider space was left for photographers and the press conference was packed creating the vital success atmosphere to set the tone to launch an important strategic project  When you choose your meeting room the size has to be such that there always appears to be more interest in the event than the organisers anticipated 
This generates atmosphere and publicity if you are looking for it  I learned this principle in the first big event I was involved in Billy Graham 's Crusade at Maine Road Stadium in Manchester in 1961 
For nearly thirty years that crusade has been regarded as one of his least successful whereas a later British Crusade at Earls Court in London in 1966 has always been seen as a triumph  An average of 35,000 people a night attended Maine Road only 22,000 a night attended Earls Court a third less 
But Earls Court only holds 20,000 and Maine Road football stadium had a capacity of 50,000 so people looking at the crowds at Manchester always saw one empty or thinly populated stand  Earls Court on the other hand was so packed we had to use overflow rooms 
Moral perceived success is what goes into the history books not actual success  The size of the venue therefore is one of your first considerations and it might be helpful here to divide conferences into two types Open and Closed 
These divisions influence all considerations in choosing your venue accessibility flexibility and presentational potential facilities crowd flow and that indefinable something charisma  A closed conference is for purely private discussion which neither wants nor needs publicity 
The other kind the open conference or public event does  You want the world to see what 's going on and must therefore attract the press and even radio and television 
Getting the right size of meeting place is always a priority  You have to ensure that everyone is comfortable that there is space between rows at the front and down the aisles 
Over-crowding distracts as much as empty seats  Plan room to breathe and have space you can move into even if it 's only a corridor where you have coffee that gives your audience and the room a break 
There are far too many places advertising conference facilities that offer nothing more than rooms of different sizes  Stay away from them 
However small your event is do n't hold it in a hotel or other venue that does not provide good crowd flow catering service easy-to-reach toilets and any other facilities you need  There are enough good venues around starve the poor ones of your business 
It is achieving your objective that matters not We always go to the Knot and Muddle  Flexibility and presentational potential are important too 
Is the management of your venue adaptable enough to cope with changes in your programme or its timing  This might be the tiniest thing but if it is wrongly handled it will inconvenience everyone and leave an uneasy or even bad memory 
Suppose you 've scheduled your meetings till 12.30 but you get through the morning 's business more quickly than you expected  Are the hotel or centre staff going to throw up their arms in horror if you want an earlier lunch so that you can press on with the afternoon session 
Before you commit to a venue go there yourself and find out what exactly it will provide and what the extras will be  Can they offer you any exclusive services or facilities 
For instance are the soft drinks in the conference sessions free do you pay for meals actually eaten or expected numbers are the hotel 's public address system and audio-visual facilities adequate and available without charge do they provide electricity and power for extra lighting free  Most conference venues fall down on the little matters of personal caring 
There are n't enough biscuits you can have tea and coffee in the morning but only tea in the afternoon no-one knows where the switches are or how the equipment works and so on  The impression you get is that no individual is taking care of your particular conference 
This attitude reflects badly on the conference service industry and demonstrates that it has still not fully come to terms with the need for quality and a caring approach in its business  The head of a training department for a big bank in the City of London recently asked me if I could help find him suitable conference locations 
We checked out hundreds of hotels but only found thirty-five or forty that met the basic-facilities criteria  He wanted to set up seventy-five gatherings a year 
The CBI Initiative 1992 held ten seminars for 150 people each in thirteen centres all over the country  The venues were hard to find 
The Americans plan things better  European conference venues suffer from chronic diseases small doors narrow stairs no lifts at all or tiny lifts added to the building as an afterthought poor electrics low ceilings miles away kitchens staff curfews meaningless rules and no ramps 
Avoid Mr Jobsworth  The man who says when you need a door opened to save a long walk It 's more than my jobsworth mate 
FIRST-CLASS HOTELS For a really good example of a venue I must point to Washington DC and either the Sheraton/Shoreham hotels individually or as a combination or the Washington Hilton  The Hilton 's ballroom is a classic model of flexible facilities 
It holds between 3,000 and 4,000 altogether but it can also be divided up by electronically controlled walls to give one area of half its size and two quarter areas  The soundproofing between its three sections is excellent and helped enormously by the fact that the PA system drops sound down from the ceiling rather than pushing it out from the front 
You can have three choirs singing their heads off in the separate sections without any of them disturbing the other  The Sheraton and Omni Shoreham hotels can cope with 5,000 delegates comfortably 
Forty syndicate rooms with full technical and catering services can accommodate forty to 200 people at a banquet and more if theatre-style seating is used  Crowd flow in these three locations is so good that non-conference guests can stay there during even the largest event without inconvenience 
Hotels that do offer good professional facilities with personal service and attention to detail are sadly still few and far between  There is huge unexplored potential in this field 
Conferences and other such events are not going to go away  The presentational aspect involves all kinds of different considerations which I shall come to presently but what they boil down to is this what can you do to make it easier for the communicator to communicate and the audience to receive the required message with minimum distraction 
No distraction is always the priority but more so at a large event  At small conferences people tend to be in the mood to concentrate 
At larger ones you have to work harder to grab and hold their attention  On the other hand some problems show up more markedly at smaller gatherings 
For example if you have sudden feedback with a microphone which produces a dreadful screech 5,000 people will just laugh  It 's more likely to throw everyone off course if it happens in a little room with a small audience 
With bigger groups the atmosphere takes over and helps combat the hitches  Smaller gatherings are more personal and the mess-ups actually stand out more and are more likely to happen 
Similarly in smaller conferences shabbiness and tattiness of surroundings stick out more everyone is closer to them  Perhaps the most noticeable factors here are cleanliness and light 
You do n't want grotty curtains draughts windows that wo n't close or open properly obvious holes in the carpet or old air-conditioning that is too noisy  Check out the seating arrangements platform or stage if there is one and its relation to the main entrance 
Speakers are handicapped when the main entrance doors are behind them and every time they open the audience 's eyes swivel in that direction and attention is gone  Also check audio-visual aids the PA system ceiling heights flooring size of access doors and sight lines 
Unless you have a very small conference of less than a hundred people avoid low ceilings it 's like being in a crowded rail commuter carriage and everyone feels oppressed and claustrophobic  I 've worked in a number of centres where the fire alarm has been set off by the heat from our lights 
In one place a television red head 800 watt light set off the sprinkler system with hysterical results  You 'd better know the theory and the practice of the venue 's fire regulations 
Some centres require all seats to be linked together in others you have more layout leeway  A good venue should have high and wide goods access doors at least 3.5m high 
Sets for exhibitions and conferences these days can be large complicated and costly  It 's no use having a fantastic set if you ca n't get it into the building 
Attempts to squeeze in through too small openings inevitably result in Laurel and Hardy-style disasters try taking a 3m panel into the Barbican in London  For any serious exhibition or conference you need commercial goods lifts 
Flow for the building materials should have no sharp corners narrow passages or stairs  Look for ramps wide passages and large loading doors 
If you can drive an articulated truck to the main floor from the street outside you know you 're in business  That 's a good point at the Bournemouth International Centre 
Be specific in checking out a venue 's own audio-visual equipment  If you know your speaker wants an overhead projector make sure they 've got one that works 
If you 're going to use slides see that the room can be darkened easily and check your sightlines  Visibility is a key factor in any event whether it 's seeing who 's opening the church fÃªte or watching a celebrity sing 
Look at how the stage is positioned and its depth or whether there are pillars or any other view-blockers  Sightlines can be a good reason for choosing a clear open hall where you can build your own platform or stage 
The principle applies even with very small conferences  A constant bane of the conference organiser is arriving at a venue to load and unload a dozen mini computers audio-visual equipment tape recorders packets of paper and the like six or eight times onto trolleys carrying them up or down steps grazing elbows squeezing into lifts or staggering miles under their weight all before arriving at the place where they have to be set up 
Not to mention the bumps and bruises on the centre 's staff going the opposite way in a hurry  Make life as easy as possible for yourself by picking a venue with good access for sets and materials 
When it comes to flooring I never fail to be amazed at the lack of consultation with the professionals when a new centre is being planned  One of the many frequent hazards in this business be it syndicate rooms or stadia is the floor surface 
The Germans do this better than most Frankfurt airport has a synthetic studded floor which is now widely imitated  It 's quiet safe and looks good 
The Americans go for the slippery when wet floors and it 's amazing how often floors can get wet  If you 're faced with a slippery floor problem it is inexpensive these days to get exhibition contractors to supply some cheap carpeting and you may want to investigate this option 
It can be money well spent making the place smarter and safer  A good presenter can create an atmosphere in an empty room or hall 
The problems usually lie not with emptiness which can be filled but with the fixed building created by a designer who thought he was being terribly clever but whose design has hindered events ever since  If you find yourself offered a standard layout of chairs do n't be afraid to try something different 
Changing things gives you the initiative  At one TV training session I swapped the whole room around putting the audience on the stage and doing the presentation from the floor 
They saw better and I had more space to work in but no-one had thought of it before  Good sight lines are more important than evenness of chair layout 
Most organisers set them rigidly in straight rows without checking whether some other design might give everyone a better view and provide more working and movement space  Now then crowd flow 
Movement of people  It 's important in small conferences where there are limited numbers moving slowly but for bigger events it 's absolutely crucial 
The answer is to make the crowd flow through not in and back out again  When people are moving in all directions meeting dead ends and trying to push back to the start it 's not only chaotic it 's downright dangerous 
It can also be a security headache  Think of a conference as an aircraft it needs air flowing over its wings to give it lift 
So you need more than just enough space in corridors past exhibition stands into and out of the main forum to the toilets and refreshment facilities more than theory or the fire inspector demands  Think in terms of ease more than possibility of movement for the number of people you anticipate 
When in doubt leave more space rather than less  In conferences our movement problems have for the most part been caused by a political insistence on cramming more chairs more people into inadequate space including the stage 
For some reason my clients nearly always ask Where can we put more people  Rarely What is the right way of achieving our objectives 
What would the best venue be  Work out ways of splitting the incoming crowd and directing them where you want them to go 
That alone would have avoided the Hillsborough football crowd disaster in 1989  Make plenty of clear highly visible signs maps even if the venue is large enough to warrant it 
Put firm barriers where you do n't want people to go and have enough stewards and security men to help  Find people who will do the job well do n't pick them just because they are there 
If you do muddle up the crowd-flow arrangements Over-stretch the facilities or pick an unsuitable venue in the first place you cause enormous distractions from the event and the message  The participants feel flustered uncomfortable annoyed and unlikely to want to come again next time 
There are certainly no more rats in the Isle of Man than anywhere else  It seems though that they handle them better 
On a recent visit we learned of a rat run from nests down to the stream through hedges across the road all well established  A new building project however wrecked a portion Of the run 
The rats in a panic on the first night hit the barricade and swarmed everywhere including some spots where they were definitely not welcome  Any similarity to people is entirely co-incidental 
I 've left the question of accessibility of the venue until last not because it 's less important but because it 's one of the most important considerations and impinges on one of the most difficult tasks any event organiser has to face getting the right number of the right people to come to it  Bottoms on seats 
Effective marketing the programme offered the speakers appearing the styles of presentation all these elements contribute to pulling in the public and the theme of bottoms on seats will appear again as I deal with them  But it 's something you must think about right from the start when you 're choosing your venue 
Unless you want to hire coaches and bus people in not unknown you must pick a place people will be able to get to fairly easily  Accessibility is not so important with the small closed conferences because the participants are usually either highly motivated in the first place because of specialist interest or commitment or their employers require them to go or at least agree that they should 
So they can come with time off work and probably on an expense account even to a far-flung location  With the larger events however the net has to be cast wider and an individual 's decision on whether to attend will undoubtedly be influenced by the convenience factor 
Amateur organisers inevitably pick a venue for the wrong reasons  It 's the turn of a particular hotel or city or they choose it because they have a vague idea that it might be rather nice to go to Torquay next year or even worst of all because We 've always had it there' 
When the motives are wrong the venue is nearly always far less than the best  A good organiser is totally objective even downright hard-hearted in choosing venue style speakers and programme 
Look at the people you 're trying to reach  What money will they have to spend on a trip 
How far will they have to travel  Will the event be worth it to them 
You can hardly expect people to make a journey of six hours round trip for an afternoon 's event unless it is very special  How near is your proposed venue to airports if it involves international visitors and the road and rail links 
It might be great to have something in Torquay if you 're hoping to draw visitors from the southwest but not if you 're trying to pull a big public audience from Tyneside  Do n't eliminate somewhere because it sounds ridiculous or out of the question 
In these days of competitive air fares many overseas locations can be as cost effective as being in the UK  In setting up big rallies in Berlin 's Olympic Stadium in 1981 we had two committee members in London my wife Marlies and me two in Berlin and two in the United States living in Virginia Beach and Los Angeles 
We found that it was cheaper for the four Europeans to travel to America than for the two Americans to come to London or Berlin  So once each month from June 1980 until June 1981 Marlies and I rushed out to Heathrow Airport early Friday afternoon flew to North America Toronto Washington DC Los Angeles Virginia Beach etc and worked in committee through Saturday 
Sunday morning we preached at different churches and flew back to London over Sunday night to bounce cheerily into the office on Monday morning  Amazingly we saved thousands of pounds that way 
Also remember that accessibility considerations apply to the media if you want to attract them  They not only have to be able to get there but they have to be able to get their words and pictures out 
This does not mean just-enough telecommunications on site it may also mean the nearness to a micro-wave or satellite TV link or surface links to a major town  For quiet study conferences remote old-fashioned ill-equipped venues in places like Scarborough and Buxton might be great 
But please not for twentieth century media conferences  Finally go to the place yourself 
I know this sounds obvious but it 's surprising how many organisers depend on brochures models and plans it 's fine to have those as well of course or even their recollections of a place five years ago when it and your needs were different  Strike up some personal rapport with the person in charge Of the centre so that he or she is more likely to go that extra mile for you 
Make sure they know what 's really going on in your mind and what your objectives are  PET HOTEL HATES THE FREQUENT ONES * narrow stairs and no lifts * low shower pressure * telephone kiosks built for left-handed midgets * only one plug down on the floor under the bed and 5AMP * hairdryers on 1m fixed lead from the floor socket 3m away from wall mirror facing opposite direction * just two 40 watt lamps to read and work by * toilet rolls positioned for contortionists only * room service that brings each course separately throughout Dallas * radiators that have n't been on for years * radiators that wo n't go off * basins that take half an hour to empty after you 've cleaned your teeth and you want to shave * stoppers that hang under the cold water tap but do n't reach the drain * stoppers that have no chain so you wallow in the dirty water to find them * toilets where you can sit down or close the door but not both 
The venue staff should be able to demonstrate all their equipment and facilities and understand your technical requests  Watch out for the Oh the electrician will be here on the day I 'm sure syndrome 
He wo n't  And beware of those who want to take over the organiser 's job 
Frequently venue staff try to set everything up before you arrive on the basis that it worked for the people before you and it 's less effort for them  No two conferences are ever the same 
You and the venue manager need to make the arrangements together  Put them in writing and be sure you know and he understands what you want to achieve 
It is far more difficult to be simple than to be complicated  John Ruskin 
When you 've set your objectives sorted out the budget chosen the venue and fixed the date the next step is to plan the programme  Again it 's of paramount importance to keep an overview so that you can gear each aspect towards achieving the objective 
If you do n't know what you want to do you can never judge whether you 've done it  Remember to achieve your objective you need to interest inform and involve 
You get the interest by inviting good speakers to talk on the right subjects and by your format variety and wherever possible the right kind of sparkle  You inform by making sure that the programme is not just froth and bubble that it has genuine body 
And you involve by making sure you draw the required visible response from the audience  So the question is not What who shall we have in the programme 
but What programme must I have to achieve my objectives  Too often people throw up ideas Let's have so-and-so as a speaker on Tuesday and a dance on the Wednesday and a banquet on Thursday without ever stopping to think how any of these will help reach goals or fit into the overall time 
They make these suggestions because Well that 's what people do at conferences is n't it  The ideas might be splendid in themselves but you must consider how they will contribute to the strategy 
Do you for instance want a disco because it will bring a welcome break to an otherwise necessarily heavy and demanding programme or could it prove too sharp a contrast and interrupt the concentration you 're trying to establish  Is a banquet going to make everyone feel pleasantly pampered or is it going to cause hangovers and indigestion the next morning when you 've got some crucial business to get through 
I ca n't decide for you but do n't ignore the questions consider the pros and cons and then decide  A programme is not just what happens in the conference hall 
It covers every aspect of the entire time that participants are present in the city or town where it 's being held  When you plan your programme start with the social and personal free time for shopping or relaxation that the participants ought to have to encourage their brains to work during the meaty sessions 
Do n't compromise that free time  If you do the participants will play truant anyway probably at the wrong times 
This goes back to what I was saying about the fellowship of conferences and similar events and how important it is for people to enjoy themselves and make contacts  They ought to get to know each other see a little of the place they are in have time to shop for family souvenirs and sample the local food and culture 
If you try to squeeze these requirements in around the mainstream business you will be left with scrappy little bits of free time that are useless and your visitors will feel cheated  So you start by saying and these are purely arbitrary divisions you can work out your own We 're here for three nights and four days let's have one evening completely free two or three meals in different interesting locations include transport time and perhaps half a day free for shopping 
Mark that time on the schedule and regard it as sacrosanct  What you 're left with then is the time for the meat of the programme 
That way you will ensure that people will be pleased they all want free time and the programme does n't suffer  A programme does not have to be conventionally nine to five structured but participants are more likely to accommodate themselves to unusual arrangements if you 've given them time for themselves 
So if you would usually start the programme with the address from the mayor at 9.30am consider having the mayor speak at a breakfast at 8am and then give everyone a two-hour break from 11am to have a sight-seeing walk or shopping session before returning for lunch  Alternatively have a lengthy heavy morning session and a free afternoon perhaps with optional social events for those who want them 
You might then have a working dinner with a business speaker  It 's the basic principle of presentation almost anything works well as long as you do it deliberately and explain it clearly and pleasantly and make it interesting 
GOOD PROGRAMMING The 1989 National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Washington was a first rate example of balanced and varied programming  It lasted three days and during that time the 4,000 delegates had a choice of plenary sessions with top speakers technical study groups workshops banquets free time and even great music 
The theme of the convention was carried through by every speaker and in every session  Since attendance at everything was voluntary there was plenty of time to view the high-tech exhibition and to mingle and chat in any of the dozens of coffee shops on the site 
Video and audio cassettes of each session were available at the bookshop within twenty minutes of the finish which is the time when people want to buy them  Another good feature was the sponsored breakfasts each morning at 7am they saved delegates expense and guaranteed a good turn out 
Every element contributes to the whole  Of course you will be enthusiastic when you 're planning a programme 
The trouble starts when people get carried away  They say Why do n't we show this great movie one evening without considering how this great movie contributes 
One man 's job was to select films for airlines and cruise ships  He lasted a week until he supplied Flight 219 Mayday to an airline and The Poseidon Adventure to a liner 
When you select an item for a programme consider how it will contribute to your goal and how it could affect mood and outlook  Be sure of the strategy before you embark on the mechanics 
Maximum razzamatazz is not always right and sometimes it can be counter-productive  Suppose you are having a conference for your sales people to tell them about a new product 
You will find that a good audio-visual presentation and some agreeable refreshments afterwards are all you need for them to welcome the information and instruction  If you want to motivate them to go out and sell that product you 've got to make them feel it is important to them 
You want them to exert their self-discipline and use their talents in your favour  So you really do n't want a situation where they go out and get drunk every night 
Catch their interest and spark their enthusiasm so that they begin to see the product 's potential  How something that is good for the company will be good for them 
How it will earn them more money  The programme for your event covers the whole period the participants are present in the city 
It includes handling their reception at the station airport or parking lot  First impressions last 
Each detail must be designed to help create the right response the desired mood to bring you another step nearer towards achieving your goals  If you are running a rally aimed at inspiring and motivating people do n't start by having them arrive in a strange city to find the car park full the nearest suitable alternative two miles away and no taxis available because it 's Sunday evening and pouring with rain 
You probably ca n't do much about the rain but you can work out contingency plans such as having helpers to park participants ' cars or arranging minibuses to shuttle between the centre and the car park  Sometimes you can turn what at first seems a mess into a triumph with a little imagination 
For instance at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton in 1988 we had to turn the building back to front for security reasons and have the main entrance at the rear  People arriving at the car park or taxi set-down point had a four or five minute walk to the main entrance which was through the ground floor of a multi-storey car park 
We appointed some friendly stewards whose sole job was to encourage people from their point of arrival to their destination  They gave information and made conversation 
We could n't shorten the walk but we made people feel better about it  When the participants finally reached the multi-storey car park they found a pleasant white-walled entrance hall with a blue muslin ceiling nicely decorated with flags and Party symbols and brightly lit 
You see it 's not up to the participants to come in the right mood  It is up to you to put them in the mood you want 
Make them feel looked after  When they get to the hotel have someone to greet them someone who knows names and can help with transport luggage the pre-registration formalities 
Provide a decent-looking security pass and all the necessary care and attention to make the participants feel welcome comfortable and enthusiastic about what is going to happen next  That way the conference gets off to a good start because people are raring to go and in the right frame of mind 
And if conference participants see that your organisation is well-run and thoughtful they are more likely to respond as you want them to  This same feeling should be carried into the first welcome meeting which should set the tone in the way that gospel singer George Beverly Shea did for Billy Graham 
It was Petula Clark who set the feeling at the first rally for Mrs Thatcher after she became Prime Minister  Her version slightly rewritten for the occasion of This is My Song brought the house down and everyone was ready to listen to the main speech 
Your guests your audience your congregation need to feel part of what 's happening  They need to know where you 're taking them 
Give them that outline the feeling of involvement and purpose at the opening session  The delegate arriving to an indifferent reception or lack of clear information even a misspelt name soon starts to believe that he 's dealing with incompetents 
He wishes he were back home  He may feel he 's in a British Rail nightmare he will get to his destination some time or other but he 's deeply unhappy about his discomfort while travelling 
I 'm reminded of the story about the time when a British Rail advertising contract was up for grabs  It was a huge budget and the top agencies were eager to get their hands on it 
It was prestigious lucrative and a creative challenge  The agencies laid on the works marvellous hospitality slick presentation sophisticated arguments 
All except one  That one invited the railway VIPs to their office to see and hear their sales pitch as the others had done 
When the big wigs arrived however they were barely acknowledged by a dour receptionist told to sit in a grubby waiting area strewn with cigarette ends and empty coffee cups and kept waiting for half an hour without either apology or explanation  Just as they were about to explode with rage the head of the agency appeared 
Gentlemen he said  Now you know how the average rail customer feels 
He got the contract  One embarrassing experience involved Jan Leeming the television personality who was taking part in a film I was producing 
Unfortunately no-one had been able to see her accommodation beforehand and we found that the hotel she had been booked into was a nightmare tatty rooms with cigarette burns door handles which fell off threadbare carpets  A colleague made cheerful conversation with Jan while another of the team hurriedly arranged a better room 
Actually Jan is a very sweet lady and a good professional and she would happily have stayed in that room but it would have been wrong  Apply the principles check it out ahead of time and put yourself in the other person 's place 
There is an old Sioux saying You can not understand a man until you have walked two weeks in his moccasins  Strictly speaking these things fall outside what most people think of as the programme 
They are just as important though as what goes on in the main body of the conference centre  It 's your attitude to people which wins them over 
A conference is a bit like a jigsaw the participants debates guest appearances audio-visual presentations workshops free and social time they all have to click together to provide the complete picture  When you come to detailed programme planning you need variety and balance and if you have a great deal to get through and a concentrated message to communicate you still have to break it up and give people a chance to relax their brains as well as their bodies 
Every programme needs highlights  There 's only one FA Cup Final one Wimbledon one Royal Ascot every season even though there 's plenty of football tennis and racing at other times 
If you provide memorable highlights people will go away feeling the whole event was good they will gradually forget the weak parts of the event though I hope you wo n't  People today are used to getting their information in small doses a newspaper paragraph a news item on television 
They have short attention spans so do n't expect them to sit for hours on end without fidgeting yawning or falling asleep  As I said in an earlier chapter the principle of speaking is not to go on for more than a few minutes without getting your audience to do something applaud or laugh or raise their hands 
The same principle applies with conference programmes  To get maximum impact break up the messages and the format 
Skilful experienced speakers will do this themselves  If you have inexperienced speakers curtail their time 
Vary the programme with humour audio-visual devices music movement colour question and answer sessions guest appearances  You want your audience to be active not passive 
You want them to respond rather like the vicar who wired-up his pews  It was a novel method of fund-raising 
Who 'll give Â£25 he asked and pressed a button  Several leapt to their feet 
Alleluia he replied  And who 'll give me Â£50 
Another button dozens more responded  Praise the Lord said the vicar 
And now Â£100  Another button and up stood the rest 
How did your appeal go a colleague asked later  Great came the reply except for one Scotsman who was electrocuted 
Perhaps a little too active but he did achieve his goal  Mealtimes provide natural variation in a programme and what you are going to offer will depend on the programme the venue 's facilities the season the numbers and your budget 
My advice here is to avoid a lot of fancy twiddly bits unless you 're running a conference for French gourmets  Most people prefer something simple and easy to eat 
They will be talking as they eat and it 's distracting and embarrassing to have to juggle something fussy and awkward while you 're trying to make new friends and business contacts  Bangers and mash is better than pretentious nouvelle cuisine though you can probably be a little more original 
The food in the hospitality rooms at the Republican Party 's National Convention in Dallas in 1984 was particularly good  They had huge piles of chilled fresh pineapple and other fresh fruits and cheeses all beautifully arranged and cut up into bite-sized pieces 
The quality was superb  No-one had to worry about plates and forks 
We all went home having had little but fruit cheese and Texas-size shrimps for three days but it was delicious convenient and appealing and there was plenty of it  Last but certainly not least when you 're planning your programme remember the hardest single task in a conference is getting people to come to it 
In-house or company conferences have a ready-made audience and your main consideration is getting the right mix of personnel senior management middle management and so forth  But for larger events you have to sell them metaphorically if not literally 
Decide who you want to attend where they are how they will get to you and what will appeal to them  There are heavy demands on people 's time these days and a lot of rival attractions 
Sometimes particularly where you have a specific audience the task may be primarily a logistical one moving them from A to B and you can solve this by bussing them in  When your potential catchment is broader based you have to find additional ways of drawing them in 
An obvious method is to advertise but be careful that you aim the right kind Of advertising in the right direction otherwise it is money badly spent  The Billy Graham organisation used to estimate that only ten per cent of their crowds came as a direct result of advertising and generally speaking I find that by itself it is the least cost-effective way of marketing events the most effective being personal invitation 
Most significant things from marriages to murders happen between people who know each other well so the best way to reach people is by word of mouth in the right places  Start with the stalwarts of the organisation and let the message fan out from there snowballing as it goes along 
All the advertising in the world will not draw people to your event if they believe they 're going to be there alone  Let them know it 's going to have a fabulous programme and be full of people they know or others of a like mind 
That 's when they get interested  When we were setting up Eurofest 75 an evangelistic congress for 8,000 young people in Brussels in 1975 a number of advertising agents came to sell me on their company 
Forty-seven countries were involved so they had dreams of a big account  One girl was a hard chain-smoking sales machine letting me know I could not set up a multi-national congress without multi-national advertising 
I asked if she had ever been to hear Billy Graham a bit unlikely I thought  Oh yes she said I heard him once 
What On earth got you to go  I asked 
Oh she said a friend came round and asked me to go with her  Ah I see what you mean 
We got 2,000 reps in forty-seven countries who averaged four recruits each  And if you want 70,000 people at a birthday tribute concert for Nelson Mandela you push the information through to organisations like CND The World Council of Churches and you 'll have a full house 
In an emergency you can of course also try straightforward bribery depending on how much you want to spend free meals free accommodation free transport etc  On the other hand you might appeal to their finer feelings their sense of duty and responsibility 
With a political party for example this might mean conveying the idea that the Foreign Secretary is making an important speech in their locality and they owe it to him to show their support  But professionally you can do much of it with your programme 
You create an interest by having appealing people to speak by arranging debates that will be gripping even controversial by having one or more celebrities present by asking a well-known band to perform by offering special food by spectacle by drama by electronic presentations  The list is long and varied and what you choose or the combinations you try will depend on what you want your event to achieve 
The bigger the event the harder you will have to work at crowd-pulling and the earlier you will have to start to build up the interest  NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST The National Prayer Breakfast in the United States is an annual gathering of political and religious leaders and other key national figures who meet to pray for the nation 
This was the programme for the 1989 meeting  Pre-breakfast prayer The Honourable Charles Grassley US Senator Iowa Opening song US Naval Academy Chapel Choir in uniform Presiding The Honourable Bob Stump US Representative Arizona Opening prayer General Larry D. Welch Chief of Staff US Air Force Breakfast chilled fresh orange juice Cheddar omelette O'Brien potatoes chutney-filled peach croissants and apple spice muffins butter and fruit preserves tea coffee and brewed decaffeinated coffee 
Message from the United States Senate The Honourable Paul Simon US Senator Illinois Old Testament reading The Honourable John Buchanan Premier of Nova Scotia Canada New Testament reading Art Monk all-pro wide receiver Washington Redskins  Solo Sandi Patti Message from United States Congress The Honourable Ike Skelton US Representative Missouri Reading Justice Sandra Day O'Connor US Supreme Court Prayer for national leaders Dr. Billy Graham Message The Honourable Alan Simpson US Senator Wyoming The President of the United States Closing song Sandi Patti Closing prayer Mrs Susan Baker 
Now that 's what I call a programme  It lasted only one and a half hours but it satisfied body and soul 
Rudyard Kipling  Right you 've worked out your budget you 've chosen your venue and you 've planned the most marvellous programme that will pack 'em in 
Now you 've got to get down to the real nitty gritty how will the stage look what about the sound system who presses what buttons for the audio-visuals and when  This chapter is about details but as usual the same principles still apply have your overall picture and your ultimate objective in mind and aim to make it easy for the presenter to present and audience to receive 
When people walk into an auditorium one thing ought to happen and another ought not their attention should be grabbed and held but at the same time they should n't fall flat on their faces because you 've failed to gaffer down a loose wire  This is hands-on conference presentation a case of have staple gun will travel 
You might not exactly be able to pack up all your troubles in an old kit bag but if your rally bag is n't packed you will have trouble  Gaffer tape for instance an all-purpose cloth tape that sticks to any surface but is easy to remove 
It is strong and not damaging and is probably the one absolutely essential piece of equipment you need above all others  Do n't as they say leave home without it 
Most people in this business opt for two-inch wide tape but I prefer three-inch black for securing every line of wire in the hall plus some two-inch white or silver to mark the edge of steps and other things you need to make noticeable  Three-inch gaffer is not common but you can get it if you hunt around 
Bitter experience has taught me to remove the gaffer at the end of the event only by holding the wire down on the floor as you pull the tape up  If you do n't hold the wire on the floor the tape will wrap itself round it and you 'll have a terrible time trying to disentangle the resulting blob of sticky goo 
You also need lots of electrical extension leads and bars of four 13 amp sockets  Fuses blow from the amount of power used not the number of sockets 
Light and heat use power  Virtually nothing else uses very much 
Thus you can run thirty electric typewriters off one 13 amp socket but only three 800 watt lamps  A simple formula to calculate the amps is to divide the watts usually marked on the bottom of the appliance by the volts the result is amps 
You can pull around 3,000 watts off one 13 amp socket  So with videos word processors and so on life is easy 
Bring in a few television lamps though and watch your amps  Are there electricians on site 
preferably not the night porter who says he knows how it works  The first rule of safety is never to have electrical wires off the ground and gaffer everything on the ground 
The second is never to leave on the floor a closed loop of wire or string  A closed loop that someone can catch their foot in and trip is one of the most frequent causes of industrial accidents 
In Covent Garden Market every band from every box of fruit vegetables and flowers is cut  The third rule is to wear hard-soled and protective shoes whenever you are setting up 
At an election rally in the Wembley Conference Centre in 1983 I stood on a nail in my training shoes and it went nearly four centimetres into my foot  Apart from not actually having members of your audience fall headlong the other main consideration when getting them into and out of their seats is ease of movement 
Organisers are frequently met with what appears to be rigid rules We always have a five foot aisle sir it 's all we need when in fact the reality should be far more flexible better suited to your particular needs and safer too  The main focus of your audience 's attention will be the backdrop and the stage and on or near it the audio-visual point and the speaking lectern 
First though one of my bugbears people on the platform  In theory the platform is for those actually taking part in the programme 
In practice the platform becomes a place for people who want to be seen those who believe that their own importance is such that the presentation of the programme is secondary to their right to be seen beside the programme participants  This leads to a definite conflict of interests yours and theirs 
In principle platform numbers should be kept to an absolute minimum  You 're trying to focus attention on the presenter the person giving the speech or answering the questions and it is a dreadful distraction to have beside and behind him or her numbers of men and women who invariably want to whisper gesticulate stare in the wrong direction scratch their heads pick their noses or make their exits at completely the wrong moment 
Who is essential is for the organisers to decide but the non-essentials who sit on platforms are basically either ignorant of the art of presentation or disdainful of it if they were n't they would n't be there  Generally there are too many bodies on stage and it may be your job to thin them out 
I 've fought this problem for years at political conferences and gradually we 've been able to improve the situation  If you compare the platform parties of the middle and late eighties with those of 1979 the effect is quite noticeable 
We 've not managed to clear the speaker 's part of the platform as entirely as the Americans do but at least we 've managed to create a decent space around the speaker  We set the tone at the Tory Conferences and the other parties have followed suit 
A thirty second commercial on ITV can cost Â£60,000 or more  If a member of the Government gets ninety seconds of news time that 's worth a lot of money 
In that ninety seconds I want every one of the 13 million viewers to concentrate on the speaker not on someone else scratching their nose in the background  The only exception I would make to this rule is if there are special guests who actually should be on-show because they enhance the programme for whatever reason 
Here too you have to be careful and weigh the advantages of their appearance against the disadvantages of their potential to distract from the message  If you are not in a position to be ruthless about getting rid of people on the platform school them in the proper way to behave sitting still looking towards the speaker and not thumping the table in their enthusiasm 
It jolts your carefully prepared and placed microphone out of position and may wobble the lectern as well  Lecterns are a whole subject in themselves but one that frequently gets overlooked 
For a start a lectern ought to be the right height for each speaker  I know that sounds obvious but even nine years after I designed it I still have one of the very few adjustable-height lecterns in the UK 
More often than not no-one bothers about the height factor with the result that the speaker may have to peer at his notes or stand awkwardly or otherwise find it impossible to combine proper use of the mike with proper use of the lectern  The speaker should feel comfortable with the lectern 's height and it must be positioned so that he can see his notes 
It should be sturdy enough to lean on if necessary  And if you 've got more than one speaker it must be adjustable with minimum fuss 
We were late in introducing this concept it took me three years of persuasion for politicians to accept the idea  Billy Graham was using an adjustable lectern twenty-five years ago he needed to since he is six feet four and some of his colleagues are a foot shorter 
In 1979 I had built a small wind-up lectern for table-top use and followed that a couple of years later with a full-size floor-standing lectern that operates hydraulically  The top half of it slides down over the bottom half so that it can be lowered right down to table-top level when a debate is going on and a speaker is sitting down 
At that point he needs to have an uninterrupted view of the audience and they need a clear view of him  Importantly the lectern is never operated by the speaker who needs full concentration on the speech and presentation 
It is operated by a colleague who assesses the right height for each speaker  The levels are marked so that they are visible some feet away you do n't want undignified scrabbling around under a speaker 's feet 
This prototype lectern is made of wood with a separate hydraulic unit  It is operated simply by pressing a button 
It cost around Â£2,000 to make in 1982 and the man who built it for me said then that it would lift one ton let alone Willie Whitelaw  A lectern should have a minimum depth of 38cm and a minimum width of 5Ocm space to hold two A4 sheets alongside each other and a lip of at least 1.5cm to stop papers sliding off onto the floor 
The lectern at the Guildhall is a classic example of one that looks beautiful but is too small and fragile to use  It 's a beautiful creation designed without thought for its function 
When Mrs Thatcher speaks at the traditional Lord Mayor 's banquet there we substitute our own humbler but more practical table-top lectern  Good lecterns today also have space for microphone wiring built into them so that you do n't have wire trailing around the place and looking unsightly or a big boom mike stand in front 
If you are using a table top cut holes in the baize covering the table to feed the wires through and keep them tidy  I like the height of the lectern to be adjustable but the Americans like to adjust the floor 
This is more expensive but it has a particular advantage in television coverage  It means the cameras can focus on the lectern knowing that the speaker will always be placed in exactly the same position relevant to it 
If there are between fifty and two hundred different cameras as there sometimes are in America it 's a major consideration  In Europe we have to strike a balance between the needs of the audience in the hall and the requirement to communicate effectively to a far larger audience through television 
A useful advance in the technology of presentation in the eighties was the advent of the autocue  Ever since I started consultancy work in politics I 'd been pushing for the use of this simple invention a British one but it was n't until after President Reagan used it in his address to the Houses of Parliament that our politicians felt it was worthy of notice 
It is a simple closed circuit television system a video camera photographing a speech being rolled beneath it  The video monitors are on the floor facing upwards in front of the speaker and there are two pieces of glass above so that the speech is reflected at the speaker 's eye-level directing his main focus at the appropriate part of the audience 
In other words the speaker can read his speech and look out into the audience at the same time  They have a clear view of him and he can hold the important eye contact 
The line being spoken is always in the same spot so that if he turns his head from a familiar sentence he can be confident that he will be able to pick up again where he left off  When you 're reading a speech ordinarily you have either to keep your finger on the spot or find it again 
With the autocue your hands and head are free to communicate body language more powerfully  The reflector glass can be positioned directly in front of the speaker but I prefer to use wing glasses on either side because it lessens the barrier with the audience and leaves more room for photography 
I also surround the monitors discreetly with flowers to avoid distracting the audience  Use of the autocue is another reason in favour of a variable floor by the way 
When Mrs Thatcher and President Reagan both spoke at the United Nations ' 4Oth Anniversary in 1985 they used the same autocue which remained in a fixed position  While the President walked off after delivering his speech someone was able to slip in a pre-built ten-centimetre platform for Mrs Thatcher and Rajiv Gandhi which was a lot less fuss than having to fiddle around re-adjusting the autocue height 
In the UK I commissioned some electrically adjusted autocue screens  Even so the same rule applies as it does to the lectern never let the speaker adjust the screens to fit his height 
Someone else must do it  The autocue operator will be back-stage cueing the speed to suit the speaker 's delivery 
It requires concentration by the operator but again I would not let the speaker do it himself  There is now also a computer autocue direct projection to the screens by a word processor 
It does not have the flexibility of the paper roll and President Reagan amongst others always preferred the safety of the mechanical roll with its additional emphasis markings  It is possible to lose the entire speech off a computer disk 
You can only lose power with the roll system and that 's much less likely  It happened however to Ronald Reagan in France once 
A power surge blew the fuse on the White House autocue and the President dried-up for a moment and then ad-libbed  I rarely take equipment from one country to another and never if there is a voltage difference as with the United States 110 volts and Europe 240 volts 
If I need the autocue in America I have one there and avoid unnecessary problems  You need to check lighting arrangements with the autocue 
If they 're wrongly placed they can blank out the screens and make them impossible to read  Lighting is one of the most effective ways of creating a good atmosphere 
You can create quite a memorable set out of little more than good lighting  Find out what your venue has to offer and whether you will need to supplement it 
Most hotels and similar venues have tracking spotlights and if you have plenty of set-up time you should be able to cheer up the most basic hotel meeting room  If television is going to be with you you will need to arrange stronger lights on the key focal points you would do well to get a set of four redheads 800 watt TV lights 
Incidentally direct a little light down behind the speaker it fills the space behind him and makes him more three-dimensional  Find out early on how dark you can make the hall 
Dimming the lights is necessary for even the simplest pieces of audio-visual equipment  The overhead projector which shows 11in by 8in 28cm x 20cm transparencies can be useful as can the slide projector 
The most consistent mistake with both these pieces of equipment possibly because they are so simple is once again to have them operated by the speaker  Do n't fall into that trap 
We 've all suffered the amateur night feeling that occurs when the poor speaker gets it wrong the upside down slide the image on the ceiling the missing bulb and the inevitable stifled titters from the audience  The only exception is the small teaching meeting when the speaker actually draws diagrams on the transparency while talking 
Make sure the equipment is planned checked and operated by someone who knows what they 're doing and who will rehearse with the speakers  There have been impressive developments of audio-visual aids recently and you might consider some of them if you 're staging an ambitious project 
Remarkable things can be done linking projectors and computers so that you get composite or varied images on a wall of screens  But there comes a point at which audio-visual presentations take over from being an aid to the speaker and become an end in themselves 
If this looks likely you have to be absolutely certain they 're going to achieve your objectives better than a human being  Generally though use special effects cautiously and for a specific purpose 
It 's easy to get carried away by the many tools at your disposal so beware of using them just because they 're there  Once in a while an audio extra creates itself 
I was once speaking to some 2,000 people in the Tent Hall in Glasgow when I noticed my audience 's attention drifting something I 'm not used to  When I investigated I found that the long microphone lines across the stage were picking up BBC Radio 2 
Since I was behind the public address speakers I could not hear it  But the audience could 
I was being accompanied by an orchestra  Long mike leads need to be properly wired to prevent them from becoming an aerial 
Lasers helium balloons streamers flags dry ice disco lights computer graphics are great at election rallies or festivals but inappropriate at most serious commercial conferences  Sometimes in the art of presentation less is more 
Take something as simple as a backdrop  It should be interesting but not too interesting fit in thematically and colour-wise but give a clean backdrop to speakers 
It has to be designed or thought out carefully so that conscious decisions can be made about it  You may decide to put a table and a lectern in front of a blank wall 
That 's fine as long as you do it deliberately and not by default  At the other extreme you could set up giant screens to show large images of the speaker as we do in larger conferences such as the Institute of Directors at the Royal Albert Hall 
The backdrop should reinforce the message of your conference either overtly with the slogan or motif emblazoned on it or subliminally by its design emphasis  If for instance your conference is concentrating on leadership and moving into the future you might design something with a slightly futuristic appearance that left the thought in the minds of the audience without being too obvious about it 
A boon to the organiser who needs a simple mobile improvement for small venues are the Supalite panels made of coloured foam with metal or plastic edges  They are light easy to set up and transport and they can cover a multitude of grotty walls 
WINNIN' When the Royal Sussex hospital called my wife Marlies after the bomb during the 1984 Tory Conference they told her there had been a little accident but that I was OK  Marlies thought I had fallen off a ladder fixing a letter G from the conference slogan of that year Britain Winning Through 
The slogan was spelled out in three-foot-high polystyrene lettering and glued onto a soft canvas backdrop  Unfortunately the powerful television lights kept melting the glue and in spite of extra large dollops of the stuff the G from Winning fell off every night and I had to be up a ladder fixing it back again at six the next morning 
It was too thick to nail and anyway the backdrop was too soft  Now I always glue nail and use a solid backdrop whenever I can I think of that episode as my belt and braces lesson 
However your event looks you still have to be sure that it 's going to sound good as well  The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words is small consolation to an audience which ca n't hear any of them 
If you 've got forty or more people use sound amplification not necessarily for volume but for presence  Like lighting sound creates atmosphere and lends authority to the proceedings 
Some people are daunted by the technology of sound but it 's basically just like water you can send it out in a jet or you can spray it gently over everyone  Spraying gives the most even coverage and is mostly best for speech 
Achieve the effect by having a number of loudspeakers at lowish level preferably facing in the same direction  There is no problem with amplifying a speaker 's voice because in a room of any size you do not hear the individual 's voice as such and the electronic sound reaches everywhere at the same time 
Music is more complicated because electronic sound travels faster than natural sound so people hear the real band a fraction of a second after they 've heard its electronic reproduction  Music therefore should always come from a single source not a single loudspeaker but a group of speakers close enough together for the natural sound to leave the platform at the same time as the electronic sound 
Think of rock concerts where they have those banks of giant speakers grouped together on the stage  Electronic equipment is also built to varying degrees of power 
To continue the water analogy it 's like a fire hose and a garden hose  You can turn down a fire hose to water a garden but you can not turn up a garden hose sufficiently to tackle a fire 
Powerful amplifiers can be turned down for a small hall but a weak amplifier has no potential for increased volume before it starts distorting the sound  To get good quality sound in a meeting therefore have fifty per cent more power than the sound man says you need 
A rough guide until you work out your own preferences is to look for amplifiers of 100 watts for meetings up to 150 people 200 watts up to 500 people 500 watts up to 1,000 people and 1,000â€“1,500 watts up to 3,000 people  For larger groups you will need supplementary power and sound sources 
The acoustics the factor that determines how sound behaves are different at every venue  Outdoors sound will evaporate so you need to compensate with more power 
With good acoustics a hall will distribute sound evenly  People soak up sound 
You need more volume for a full hall than an empty one so allow for that when you 're testing which will probably be in an empty hall  Watch out for metal roofs and high ceilings they 'll make the sound bounce around like water off a tin roof 
The Royal Albert Hall has acoustic panels in the roof to absorb bouncing sound  In Earls Court in 1966 before the days of good acoustic panels we draped silk parachutes from the roof in an attempt to cut down the echo nowadays technology helps 
There was a strange side effect to the cleaning of the Winter Gardens Empress Ballroom in Blackpool which was cleaned and restored to its original Victorian splendour in 1984  The ballroom looked beautiful but when Sir Basil Feldman stood up to give the opening address at the Conservative Conference though his projection was fine and his microphone working half his audience had difficulty hearing and a third were hearing twice 
You see when they took a century 's dust and dirt off those walls they completely changed the acoustics swapping grubby absorbency for beautiful bright marble which bounced the sound all over the place  Beware of feedback the dreadful shriek or whistle when a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker the inanimate not the human kind 
What happens is that the mike hears the sound going into it being amplified by the system and then coming out louder behind it again  This noise then feeds back into the microphone again causing that awful sound and complete confusion 
If you get a little ringing in the microphone sound try a little less treble on the tone controls  You can change the tone of treble or base 
A balance is possible for both music and speech and the right adjustment will make a noticeable difference  Each individual sound source microphone tape recorder etc will have its own level control into the amplifier or mixer 
When you are testing balance the volumes of the different sources  You will then find a master volume control on the amplifier that raises the whole balanced mix to the right level for that audience without affecting the balance of the individual sources 
Test your mikes for sensitivity tone pick-up range best position and so on before the proper balance check  Play with them without an audience but remember to make adjustments when the audience is present 
Ability with sound systems only comes with practice and the more you learn about sound the more respect you have for it  It is seldom simple and even the more experienced operators make mistakes often because they do not understand the difference between source what the original sound is like and acoustics what happens to it when it leaves the loudspeakers 
At Billy Graham 's 1961 Maine Road Stadium Crusade low-level multi-speaker systems meant that music from choir and instruments was travelling around the stadium electronically and then being chased by the real sound with the result that everyone heard everything at least twice  We had to build sound towers by the stage to get the music amplification right 
With Billy Graham again at the Lausanne Olympic Stadium in 1974 we had made no allowance for the effect of the wind on sound it blows it around like rain  Some of the time the Germans at one end of the stadium were hearing the French translation while their own language was floating with the wind over the top of the stadium and down to Lake Geneva 
QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION In the Euro 70 television crusade from Dortmund in Germany we reached thirty-six cities in twelve countries through live closed circuit television on big screens 100,000 people a night watched around Europe  The speech was translated phrase by phrase into six languages 
Billy Graham would say Good evening ladies and gentlemen and six translators would repeat the phrase in their own languages their mikes feeding the appropriate centres  Each pair of interpreters was in a small booth by the Dortmund platform with one microphone a cut-off button and a television showing the broadcast picture 
There was discussion after the first night between the Welsh interpreters Rheinallt Williams and David Sheppard  Would n't it be better not to translate Billy 's invitation to come forward as the people at the Welsh meeting understood English and it allowed a quiet moment between Billy 's phrases 
Well last night said Rheinallt I kept right on interpreting Billy through the invitation  Oh no you did n't Rheinallt said David 
I had my finger on the button  Rehearsal pays and steers you around disasters 
That means rehearsing everything  If necessary climb the scaffolding yourself to get the lights right 
Do n't take it for granted that they 'll be OK  Try out the PA system on site do n't take the management 's word that they 'll do it for you 
You 'll arrive to find they 've stuck the mikes just where you do n't want them  Work out and run through your lighting and music cues 
Music that is to be played as part of a programme must be chosen with care  Do n't Cry For Me Argentina is n't quite right for a Falklands Veterans ' meeting 
I have some fun sometimes though  We played Who Wants To Be A Millionaire during the collection at one big conference 
National Anthems never assume your venue will have one on tape  At one meeting a chairman blithely told me as he went on to the platform that they would have the National Anthem at the end changing his mind without consulting me first 
I did n't have a recording of it with me Mrs Thatcher was already on her feet and there was no way I could interrupt to reverse the decision  I managed to get a police car to rush me through security to the shopping precinct 
I dashed into a record shop begged a loan of the album transferred it onto cassette in Dixon 's next door sped back to the hall and managed to shove it into the system just as the chairman announced it and the audience was standing  I now carry one with me everywhere 
But if you 're thinking of doing the same make sure you get a recording that can be sung-along with and not one of those dragged out funereal dirge versions  Everything needs rehearsal and not just in the venue 
If you are on a site-recce and you hit on an idea or a way of solving your problem do a dry run  Someone will say they 've got a machine that prints names on badges 
The machine can completely fail to work because no-one has bothered to test it before the day  In 1988 I was producing a major women 's conference at the Barbican and we needed a big bank of flowers 
Twenty-odd years earlier I 'd picked up an idea from the marvellously creative Bill Brown who was Director of Billy Graham 's Crusades in 1966â€“7  I was his assistant and when he wanted flowers he would send me to the Old Covent Garden at 4.30am to buy hundreds of pots of chrysanthemums which would then be sold off at the end of the day thus serving a dual purpose as decoration and a means of recouping some of our costs 
I realised things might not be the same nowadays so ten days before the conference my assistant Joanne and I went down to Covent Garden which is now at Nine Elms and had a trial run  We discovered that you now need Â£2 to get in and give a week 's notice for 300 pots 
If we 'd left it to the day we 'd have been sunk  One person has to be responsible for co-ordinating all these different elements and the need for an integrated approach with one person carrying the overview was brought home sharply to me during a Youth Conference in Eastbourne in 1983 
My wife and I were actually in Hawaii at the time combining business and pleasure secure or so I thought in the knowledge that everything was running smoothly  In fact just about everything that could go wrong went wrong 
The television lighting shone right into the autocue dazzling the speakers and making the apparatus unusable  Staff got frazzled speakers got angry and there was almost a fist fight between some of my colleagues and the lighting technicians 
Someone had brought the adjustable lectern and set it up perfectly but not bothered to find out the heights of the speakers  And so it went on 
The problem was not that people had not done their jobs they had  But they had only done their own jobs 
What was lacking was the professional overview  The resulting chaos was so memorable that I 've never dared take a holiday during a conference again 
If you have the co-ordinating role an important priority is to be everywhere early  If a conference is due to start at 9.30am be there at 6.30am 
That way you have time to find problems and put them right  You have time to digest the unexpected worm as they say about early birds 
Most organisers swan in at eight-thirty looking important only to discover there 's a big hitch and they have no time to put it right  And the craziest things can happen at the last minute 
There was a youth dance during one conference I staged and at six the next morning I did an automatic check on the adjustable lectern Only to find graffiti-covered papers stuck all over the front  They did n't show when the lectern was down but imagine the audience 's laughter if they had popped up with the lectern and the speaker 
It took us One and a half hours to clean up but my early start gave us plenty of time  No audience wants to start off with blunders 
You have a long way to go to win them back  In Southport recently we had planned a 3Oft 9m Portakabin to serve as part of a wall around a car park 
Someone somewhere however changed the order for the Portakabin and we ended up with a 15ft 4.5m one  We then did n't have enough materials for the wall so we had to shorten its length which in turn meant there was not enough room for media vehicles and not enough space for VIPs to manoeuvre their cars in and that meant altering security arrangements 
All these complications arose simply because someone thought a smaller cabin would be big enough but had not bothered to consult the professionals  Once in Porthcawl in South Wales I was trying out my hydraulic lectern and discovered it had developed a horrible squeak 
Again I had time to find a garage that had opened early and had a welder  We got him to come and fix it before the first session 
At a Local Government conference someone at the venue had put up the mikes but had not checked to make sure they were fixed properly so they were slowly drooping  Mikes always need careful adjusting to catch the speaker 's voice but not hopefully his eye 
At yet another conference police dogs searching the hall before the opening session broke the teleprompter  Your excessively early arrival means that you can check the aforesaid dogs are not using your beautiful flower arrangements as their loo and also run through a technical check and the autocue before anyone else gets there 
That 's how you discover the odd rude word that 's been written on the script by some joker before the VIP inadvertently reads it out  Be nice to staff and volunteers as much as possible 
One well-known television personality is said to be rather hard on the teleprompter operators  At a live broadcast he started to read his autocue lines Hello and good evening 
You 're on your own now we 've gone home  COST FACTOR Staging needs an imaginative mind 
And occasionally you have to balance results and cost  A director filming on location in a stadium was spending Â£20,000 per hour 
His assistant should have directed a scene after lunch but the director returned to find things at a stand-still  Why no filming he asked 
We ca n't find the caretaker to open the locker-room door replied the assistant  Kick the thing down said the director 
The delay has cost Â£20,000 and we can buy a gold door to replace it for less than that  A man Sir should keep his friendship in constant repair 
Samuel Johnson  The most exciting and terrifying thing about political campaigning is that it is a tangible measure of your communication skills 
In the other fields I 've discussed earlier public speaking appearing on television staging a special event holding a conference you can but you should n't kid yourself that they went better than they really did  But in an election the facts speak for themselves if you do not get the right message across to the right people you lose 
This applies whether you are trying to get yourself elected as a parent governor a church committee member or a party leader  Now let's get something clear at the beginning 
As with other effort to make an impact if you want to be success you must have substance in your message  A quality product fillet steak not offal 
But once you have the steak it is the sizzle the tantalising mouth-watering aroma the surrounding cleanliness and the personal credibility of the butcher and the chef that persuades the customer to choose it  Political campaigning goes on all the time of course not just in the run-up to a major election 
That is just the intensification the high point of an ongoing process  In the UK the political parties maintain a permanent grass roots organisation for this reason 
In America the organisational style is geared to mobilize people only for specific projects  By instinct the Americans are geared to winning the British to playing the game 
The Americans recognise that professionals can achieve more the British resent the professionals interfering in what is always done  Fortunately in the eighties we have begun to recognise that modern communication skills go far beyond the concept of advertising 
Even so when we gathered together a superb voluntary team of some of the UK 's top communicators for both the 1983 and 1987 General Elections the Conservative Party could not find any strategic use for them  The groups contained some of the most talented creative experienced and successful people in UK marketing and public relations 
In effect the equivalent of a million pounds-worth of fees went unused  The Americans have learned to bring in their big guns whenever they need them 
The Republicans and Democrats tick over with a skeleton staff and then hire specialist consultants for each campaign  The directors of the 1988 Republican National Convention for example were political campaign experts seconded from their companies in Washington to the New Orleans event for six months 
In theory our system ought to work better  If we had a well-oiled party machine we should be able to move into a higher gear every now and again to win elections 
In practice it does n't  It makes people stale and dull 
We need a radical reassessment of what our organisational goals are and how we will achieve them  Getting your supporters enthusiastic at the right time requires strategy and planning and that is a political weakness in the UK 
I 've been advised to stay away from political jokes they too often get elected but in the UK party workers say If you put a monkey up for Parliament here and stuck a red or blue rosette on him he 'd get in  The point they are making is that for the most part people still vote more for political parties in Britain than for the individual candidate 
In America it 's the Opposite especially in presidential elections  There voters opt for the individual and a big chunk of campaign money is spent on what we call name identification getting voters to know your candidate 's name 
Political agents in the UK often refer to their candidate as an unfortunate necessity  He or she could get in the way of the running of the party machine 
But thank goodness that is changing  The human side of politics is getting stronger 
It 's never been clear though if you have a Conservative seat say in the West Midlands whether people vote because they think Mrs Thatcher is doing a good job or because they are worried about a local problem or because Mrs McJones next door was helped by the sitting candidate over her rates problem  People are influenced not just by political parties or candidates but also by national regional and local considerations 
In some seats there will be a substantial personal vote for a long-serving well-liked MP  When such MPs die or step down the resulting by-election often provides big shock waves 
Crosby in 1981 was a classic example the voters lost a man they had known for thirty years and they did n't know who to vote for instead  There was virtually no constituency organisation to cope with a major campaign it had not been needed for three decades 
Shirley Williams stumbled on to the scene and a 19,000 Conservative majority turned into a 5,000 SDP 1981 version one  By the time the General Election arrived eighteen months later there was a good candidate Malcolm Thornton now MP a renewed constituency organisation and time for the people of Crosby to realise that they 'd done in that panicky moment when they were looking for a familiar face as their Member of Parliament 
Some trends happen without anyone being quite sure why  For instance if a party does well in local government elections in May it is likely to do well in another election a month later despite the fact that the local authority is quite separate from the Westminster or European Parliaments 
But it would be a mistake to conclude that the results must be similar  Separate strategic planning and professional campaigning could produce substantially different results in two such campaigns 
Voting patterns are a complex business and my colleague Keith Britto who is an expert in these things tells me that no research has been able to disentangle all the strands of voting motivation a crucial point to remember in planning a campaign  There are two elements in an election at every level from parish council to national government environment and organisation 
By environment I mean the mood the atmosphere of the campaign its tone and the preoccupations Of the voters  These determine the priorities of the campaign and the emphasis on projecting the image of the party and its people 
The organisation local and national has to build on this environment and use it as powerfully as possible  National activity highlights the parties the leaders and most of the issues 
If the national mood is wrong even the very best organisation is unlikely to win a local election  The local emphasis more often needs to be on the candidate getting his name face personality and position known in the community and introducing him to key groups of people 
As I said earlier name identification campaigns are routine in the United States but not so common in Europe although there have been cases where a candidate has been so successfully promoted that he has won despite his local party 's unpopularity at the time  As a military analogy with the political campaign as your battleground the generals at headquarters would gather intelligence study the enemy develop overall strategy and provide hardware and ammunition 
It is the troops on the ground who do most of the fighting  The troops must be enthusiastic well briefed well equipped and in touch with headquarters 
It 's always said that Oppositions rarely win elections Governments lose them  It was Jim Callaghan 's dithering in 1978 and failure to anticipate the horrors and effect of the winter of discontent that contributed substantially to Labour 's defeat in the General Election the following year 
By then they were running round frantically trying to excuse everything that had happened  They broke the basic rule of presentation which applies in politics as much as it does in other fields 
Whatever you do do it deliberately be seen to be in control Of the situation  Just saying Crisis what crisis is not the way to do it 
In 1979 Labour was obviously in a panic that set the mood  The Tory party used that atmosphere to its advantage and combined it with its Organisational skills to produce a Conservative victory 
Before you start thinking about mood and atmosphere or revving up the party machine what you must have are the facts  What are the voters in your electoral area thinking and feeling 
The foundation of all political campaigning has to be opinion research  In national terms this must be done professionally 
Locally it needs to be done to as near a professional standard as possible  What will not do though you 'd be surprised how often this happens anyway is a group of political activists getting together and saying Auntie Flo thinks that or I think a good slogan would be 
You need qualitative and quantitative research  First a small representative group discussing subjects in depth with a trained observer leading and reporting conclusions 
Then quantitative research testing those themes reactions and conclusions on a larger sample of people  If your research is good it gives you the base from which to start 
You take the nasty results with the nice examine them thoroughly and dispassionately and ask these questions What are people really concerned about  What do they think of us and our opponents at this moment 
What would change their thinking  What do they want from us 
Before you take off on your campaign be sure you know whether you can genuinely meet the voters ' needs without compromising your convictions and standards  When you can your campaigning will reflect it 
When you ca n't you have to explain why you ca n't and try to convert the voters  Just proving that you are right and they are wrong will lose the election for you 
You must win the hearts as well as the minds  The fact that you 're dealing with abstracts makes it hard 
If voters say they want politicians to care how do you show it you ca n't suddenly burst into tears  The Conservatives have always had to tackle this particular problem by tying care in with action and results 
Not only did we care we did something about it  Not only did we want to improve something but we have created the wealth to make more resources and improvements available for social needs 
What you say during a political campaign is the concrete foundation of it  It is however at most only ten per cent of the impact of the communication 
The rest is presentation  THE X FACTOR Here are two examples of involuntary agenda emphasis the situation where the agenda is set by events beyond the control of politicians 
In the 1988 General Election in Sweden the Social Democrats had a huge sympathy vote lingering on after the murder of Olaf Palme while he had been Prime Minister some years before  So despite a good campaign by the Moderate Party and some dissatisfaction with the Social Democrats the emotional factor still returned the Social Democrats to power 
In Denmark the same year Prime Minister Schluter went to the polls after a social democrat coalition defeated him in Parliament and ruled that NATO ships coming to Denmark must be nuclear weapon free  It was doubtful whether Schluter could remain in control but two emotional anniversaries during the campaign helped to keep defence as the issue April 9 was the anniversary of the German invasion and occupation of Denmark in the Second World War and May 9 the anniversary of the Liberation 
Schluter won  An image is projected not created 
If you do not have the substance you will fail even with the help of media coaches and image creators  If they were that good they would have told you to forget it until you had a good message or product to project 
As that great veteran of many political campaigns Lord  Thorneycroft said in 1978 In the end Harvey image is what you are 
You can not project a phoney  That is why 
Labour 's campaign failed in 1987  Glitz glamour and gloss can not replace substance they can only enhance it 
The word image conjures up something insubstantial an illusion a gimmick  In fact it 's just the opposite 
When you project an image you project an intensified version of the original  A clarified version of a reality 
The man or woman in the street can not know their leaders personally  But they can know them in the sense of getting a feel for the sort of person they are a closeness with them even an affection 
That 's what image means and it 's what we try to do in political campaigns  We project the politicians beyond their immediate circle of personal contacts out to the people who matter 
What we project is the essence of our politicians the nature of their convictions  It 's making the most of what you 've got 
The first and most powerful image projector today is television  Everybody has access to it and politicians ignore it only if they are thick or arrogant 
It is tempting to fantasise that leaders and parties make their reputations through finely tuned arguments in the House of Commons or speeches in far-flung halls  The truth is that political leaders project their image nowadays in ninety-second sound bites on radio and television 
Advertising is a one-way hard-sell in a political campaign and can be a good motivator as long as it does n't try to sell the voter something his guts tell him is n't true  It can also help to set the debate agenda if it is strategically planned 
It is however a reinforcer and emphasiser not a converter  A girl sits down with a man and he says I 'm very romantic that 's advertising 
A girl sits down with a man and he says What you need is a good romance and it so happens I 'm very romantic that 's marketing  A girl sits down with a man and she says I hear you 're very romantic please take me to dinner that 's Public Relations 
Newspapers do develop the discussion in much more detail but people are more likely to be turned off by newspapers than  On so their effect is negative rather than positive 
The written press provides back-up analysis and in-depth knowledge but rarely encourages or inspires people  That comes from television 
To put it another way people get their minds going from newspapers and their hearts moving from TV  And we win the heart first then the mind 
How individuals come across on television usually depends on how much understanding effort and practice they are prepared to give to it  I 've discussed this in the chapter on radio and television 
In a political campaign television exposure is magnified many times so the projection of the image has to be co-ordinated consistent and continuous  Though you project not create an image with a proper understanding Of broadcasting you can create Opportunities for politicians to project themselves 
If the public is to get the message it must be presented to them many times  We therefore combine television and newspaper coverage 
The viewers get a glimpse of an event or person on the early evening news another taste at nine or ten in the evening and hopefully a bit more detail and not too much distraction in the following morning 's papers radio and TV  I sat in a thirteenth-century hall in Bruges in September 1988 and listened to Mrs Thatcher 's speech on the future of Europe 
It was one of the most powerful positive and visionary speeches I have heard her give in eleven years  I got up feeling encouraged and thoroughly supporting her strong positive vision of Europe 's future 
The next morning the newspapers headlined what I thought was a completely different anti-Europe speech  I even wondered just for a moment if she had unknown to me made another negative speech later in the day 
It was only weeks after the speech that I began to read in the press that actually her theme had been positive and she had presented a positive forward view  The media had created a false image of an anti-Europe Mrs Thatcher but because it was created without substance from a small out-of-context part of her argument it did n't last long 
In 1980 I was at the Cleveland debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter  On television and in person it was vividly clear that Reagan won at least 9 to 1 
In the Bush-Dukakis debate in 1988 Bush won at least 7 to 3  On both occasions the press reported a draw or a very close thing because they were concerned only with the mind the argument 
Television projected to the hearts of the people and we know the results  Some people purport to be experts in political campaigning but still refuse to accept television as a major medium 
They think that gearing a campaign towards maximum effective coverage is demeaning  They are either blind or foolish 
After personal contact television is the fastest and most powerful way of winning people  We who have been classed as image-makers in Europe and the United States are proud of the job we do 
I have worked with and studied strategical political campaigning in many countries among them France Germany  Malta Norway the United Kingdom and the United States 
In every case television in its full variety of formats has been the primary influence in projecting the parties ' images  In Malta in 1981 we faced a socialist black-out of the Centre Nationalist Party from any access to Maltese television 
The Nationalists set up their own TV station in Sicily and beamed into Malta  An estimated fifty per cent of the Maltese population watched those broadcasts and the Nationalists won 50.7 per cent of the votes 
Elections can be and are won or lost on television  An image can change on that screen suddenly and dramatically 
When George Bush addressed the Republican National Convention in New Orleans in 1988 he was still seen as a wimp  He was still behind in the polls 
His fortune changed suddenly and dramatically when all America watched his acceptance speech on TV  I had got myself down on the floor of the Superdome Convention Hall to make a video 
He began his speech in fairly predictable George Bush style slow and a bit boring  Then he said dryly We 're not going to be too hard on our Democrat opponents 
I 'm going to work at keeping my charisma in check  Suddenly I felt the atmosphere change 
People were no longer thinking He 's all we 've got we 'll probably be OK instead it was This guy is big enough to laugh at himself  He 's going to be President and a good one 
It sunk into 30,000 delegates and millions watching at home that this man knew he was not a charismatic orator but he knew too that he was going to be President and he could handle it  He showed us George Bush the man as well as the politician 
It goes back to my point that genuineness is the key  If you 've got it flaut it 
In his thirty-first year in show business Cliff Richard was the top of the UK pops for Christmas 1988  His No 1 was Mistletoe and Wine a song of his Christian testimony 
The pop world expected Silent Night by the group Bros to oust Cliff  With exaggerated hype Silent Night climbed to second place but at Christmas it was Cliff No 1 and Bros behind him 
Two Christmas songs  The difference 
Cliff 's conviction showed  People respond to gut genuineness in a way that they can not respond to phoney image 
The televised debate in October 1988 between Bush and Dukakis was virtually a repeat in terms of people-winning of Reagan/Carter in 1980  Television showed Reagan and Carter as they were 
Reagan genuine confident warm and human  Carter cold stiff impersonal and lacking confidence 
People liked what they saw in Reagan and the campaign was won in that debate  Dukakis had similar flaws to Carter lack of political substance and lack of belief in what he himself had to say 
He said I think I 'm fairly lovable with a face as cold and unlovable as if he were dissecting a fish rather than trying to reach his fellow human beings  Later in the campaign his media advisers tried desperately to create a new Dukakis by injecting comments such as I am a liberal I am against capital punishment but I would feel like killing the person who harmed my wife and children 
Of course it did n't work  Bush 's belief in what he was saying was obvious 
Dukakis seemed to be reciting words merely to try to manipulate voters  If your body language eyes mouth expression and voice contradict the words you are saying the words will be meaningless and even counter-productive 
If you have nothing to say do n't open your mouth and prove it  Dukakis 's television performance and interviews gave it all away as did those of his supporters 
They knew they were going to lose  The newspapers in Europe were seriously claiming the battle was close and that Dukakis could even win enough States to pull it off 
But he knew he could n't and his supporters knew it  They used phrases like We 're going to surprise them It 's going to be real competitive 
They were going through the motions on television but their voices face and body language were vividly clear they knew they would lose and they were putting on a brave front  What they may not have realised is that that message conveyed itself to the American public 
Television is the most personal and intimate communication medium there is  When you 're on it make sure you believe what you 're saying 
DEBATING POINT Good presentation points to and highlights the message at the heart  When Jimmy Carter suggested that the world would be a dangerous place if Ronald Reagan became President at their televised debate in Cleveland in 1980 Reagan replied There you go again Jimmy and smilingly put Carter right on some facts 
What that sentence really said to the audience and viewers was It 's people who matter to me and I 'm going to take care of my fellow Americans real well  When Carter a few minutes later in the debate said I asked my eight-year-old daughter Amy last night what she thought what the audience heard was I 'd better try to find a warm human illustration before it 's too late 
He was too late  Projecting an image particularly in Europe is not just maximising the television potential of particular people 
It is also about carrying that image into every other aspect of the political campaign so that the whole really is greater than the sum of the parts  The image has to be both of the politician and of the party 
Professionally the two should go together  A local candidate at variance with the national campaign may please the press but it rarely wins the people 
In developing an image you and your workers professional or voluntary have to swallow your pride smile at yourselves and put yourselves in second place to getting the message across not easy not often said but true  So face it 
All too often in politics we are handicapped by the fact that Mrs Jones has done something a certain way for twenty-seven years and therefore must be allowed to do it again this time  The real world has long left behind the age when old so-and-so could decide I rather like this slogan or My constituents think we ought to do such and such without that feeling being backed up by professional research and experience 
In the Church and in politics we are cursed by a number of opposite extremes  If it was good enough for the Apostle Paul/Disraeli it 's good enough for me at one end 
Or We 've got to be high-tech use computers at the other  All this American razzamatazz we do n't want it here or Let's have balloons and bands for everything 
It 's not playing the game that is most important it 's winning and a professional assessment of which methods will achieve that  And just in case it is suggested that I 'm saying the end justifies the means let me confirm that I 'm not 
You can assume that I mean legitimate ethical and otherwise proper methods  Now I would not ignore hunches insight or occasional flashes of brilliance that can come from anybody as long as they do not become a substitute for objectivity and professionalism 
Today 's political campaigning requires trained and experienced communicators familiar with modern practices in opinion research public relations and marketing  That means understanding the principles of communication and custom applying them to a campaign not just throwing hardware at people and showing them the switches 
So if you are serious about winning put your prejudices away and start again  People often believe they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices 
Technology is not just about making clever films for party political broadcasts or staging breathtaking rallies but more about helping weld your communications strategy into a coherent whole  For years we have had the technology for every constituency headquarters to be linked to a central databank of key information 
Every candidate can have instant access to the national leaders ' comments  The candidate can call up the data and be briefed throughout the day about new statistics party policy developments and relevant events 
Sadly because our party political management systems have had to centre on now these strategic concepts are slow in coming into use  Such technology properly used would more than pay its way coming into its own during the intensity of an election but maintaining its worth all year round in enabling swift and efficient communication between headquarters and members 
I 'm not referring to top secret information if the other parties are interested enough to hack their way into the system they might be converted  While I 'm on the subject of secrecy it is true to say that many politicians sometimes justifiably are paranoid about the subject 
Fair enough at senior government level when there are so many leaks in the system  Nonetheless it is impossible to carry out a strategy if those who are meant to implement it do n't know what it is 
The image you are projecting for your campaign will not be confined to people  It must be echoed in slogans posters the visual design of venues for meetings speeches interviews rallies and press releases 
There must be a unity of concept and content in everything from your banners to the banner headlines  It is known commercially as a corporate identity 
An image after all is the way people see you  If you are not prepared to project it properly it is most likely that people will only see the wrong parts 
A campaign strategy needs to have an in-built system of self-criticism and self-assessment  How are the plans being carried out 
How effective are they being in achieving your objective  What can be done to make them more successful 
You need flexibility to change tack if you are not getting it right  Be aware of the time limit no election campaign goes on for more than three or four weeks in the United Kingdom be glad about that 
People have a limited capacity to sustain interest in politics  It 's one reason why there is so much apathy in America where campaigns seem never-ending 
Do n't let time overtake you  This was a major mistake in the Dukakis camp 
The Democrats clearly felt guilty about their liberal politics and thus uneasy when Bush attacked them  Their initial response was denial 
Then far too late anyway the Dukakis advisors decided to change tack and try to make liberalism sound decent by linking it to names from the past like Kennedy and Truman  It was so obviously a panic reaction that it fooled nobody 
Not only had they failed to think it through under the what if strategic planning heading but they had also failed to consider how they were going to project the change or how the people were going to react  They had made the more usually British mistake of asking What shall we do rather than the standard American approach of What has to be done to achieve our objectives 
On the whole especially at local level the Left in Britain has been more goal orientated than the Right  When the Left want to take control of a particular constituency they look at its controlling group and note that over a six-month period the maximum number of people attending the decision-making meetings is never more than say twenty-seven 
Question What is our aim  Answer Control 
Question How do we get it  Answer Get fourteen people to vote for us 
Then they select fourteen people and go after them one by one  It is no good complaining about militants running everything if we have not spotted what is happening because we 're so busy doing it the way we always do 
In America campaign leaders ask How much money do we need to do the job properly  They then look at that figure break it down into separate realistic amounts achievable in various ways and set up the systems that are going to raise that cash 
In the UK we say How much money have we got  Oh dear we 'll have to run the project On that budget 
A winning campaign strategy comes from answers to the questions  What must we do to get our supporters to turn out on the day 
What must we do to firm up the opinion of those who almost support us  How many people do we need to convert 
And what must we do to neutralise the opposition  I believe that campaigns should be at least 70 per cent positive for your side and no more than 30 per cent knocking your opponents 
Ideally I like to see a ratio of 85 per cent positive  15 per cent negative 
I do n't like heavy knocking campaigns which at best seem sour and at worst backfire  In Opposition of course you have to criticise harder but that criticism has to be seen to be reasonable if you are to succeed 
Dukakis on defence and crime and Kinnock on defence and the economy were perceived to be weak  They failed to pick their own high ground or to control the political agenda 
We can not lose touch with political reality  What do we do them or try to discourage their supporters from voting 
There are elections at all levels where it can be better for a party to have a low turn-out overall because those who do vote will tend to be your people  Everyone is free to vote but your objective is to win not to guarantee a high turn-out 
If you run a high-profile fancy campaign it will alert everyone to the fact that they should be voting and the proportion in your favour could shrink rapidly It may be better to run a low key affair targeted directly at your own supporters  Perhaps I should point out here that there 's a distinction between the before and the after of an election 
Once someone is elected they serve every member of that constituency antis as well as pros  While campaigning you owe it to your convictions to do the best you can to win 
I 've watched a lot of American campaigning at close quarters including the primaries and presidential election of 1980 the Republican Convention in 1984 when I also spent a week travelling with Ronald Reagan and the most recent Republican  Convention in New Orleans in 1988 
There is a lot we can learn from them without having to copy slavishly  The Conservative Party in this country has been hindered by the concept that winning the argument automatically means winning the people 
The Socialists have historically been better at going for the gut-level reaction  It 's only really in the last two general elections that we have begun to bring fun and excitement into campaigns to raise people 's enthusiasm to the point where they can let down their reserve a little bit 
The other parties have followed the Conservative lead and we have completely changed the face of political presentation since the early 1980s  We 're no less serious of purpose today but we may now seem a little less po-faced 
In that way the electorate see us as people first Conservatives second and politicians third  And that 's the way it should be 
STRANGE SEAT MATES On one of my planning visits to Washington I sat next to a pleasant young lady on the plane out  We chatted a little after the movie and well out over the Atlantic at 37,000ft I commented that a lot of my consultancy work was with the British Conservative Party 
What funny seat mates she said I 'm with the IRA  And she was 
I checked her out with the FBI and she raised funds for the IRA in the United States not illegal at that time and carried the money across to her IRA contacts every month  I told her that I had been involved in one of the IRA attacks when I had been blown up in the Brighton Bomb and that I had friends and colleagues who had been badly hurt or killed 
I have nothing against you personally she told me quietly but that was one of the happiest days in my life we almost brought the Thatcher Government down  Sad she was bright educated and charming but with such a bitter heart 
In the end image is what you are  The humblest citizen of all the land when clad in the armour of a righteous cause is stronger than all the hosts of Error 
William Jennings Bryan  Technology is a wonderful thing and I 'm one of its greatest fans 
I use it throughout my work because used skilfully and imaginatively it can make any sort of communication more powerful more exciting and frequently a lot more fun  But if you want your message to have impact you need people-power first and foremost 
This is especially true in political campaigning  You can have first-rate candidates experienced political and communications professionals and all the sophisticated equipment money can buy but if you do n't have the grass roots organisation as back up you will probably fail 
The professionals motivate guide provide resources and strategy but at the heart of a political campaign are its voluntary workers  No politician or party can function without such an army 
They decide whether you win or lose  If you have a strong enough army of voluntary workers you can conquer the world or even turn the People 's Republic of Islington blue 
America and Germany are countries which are particularly good at recruiting and keeping in regular contact with their supporters which makes it far easier to galvanise them when you need them most in the run-up to an election  We for the most part are bad at this 
We approach it in a hit-and-miss sort of way instead of through a systematic communication programme  One of the most effective ways to recruit and encourage members and supporters is by direct mail 
You can target particular groups you think are likely supporters draw a response and then keep in touch  The Christian Democrats in Germany have a tradition of good quality newspapers 
They are well-produced have interesting human and political content and are mailed not hopefully dumped in offices for volunteers to deliver to 600,000 party members every month  Members are kept in touch with party people and activities political news and views and social events 
They stay interested and involved  The Americans specialise in the personal touch with individualised laser-printed letters 
They are also skilful in their deployment of famous names  It 's a rare person who can ignore a letter sent personally to him over the signature of Clint Eastwood or Charlton Heston saying I need your help 
I 've been involved in direct mail ever since my first days with the Billy Graham Organisation in the early sixties  We pioneered the technique well before it became used on so large a scale by giants like American Express and Reader 's Digest 
As with any technique direct mail has basic principles which must be obeyed if the programme is to communicate and raise money over a long period * It must be regular a minimum of eight times a year * It must be personal relevant and informal * It must be good quality * It must ask for and offer something * It must appeal to emotion first and reason second  As we enter the nineties we are progressing slowly with direct mail in UK politics but national attempts by the different parties have failed for one reason or another 
Mostly they 're haphazard so that you do n't hear anything for months at a stretch or they 're impersonal or the responses are not followed-up and developed or they are stupefyingly dull  That 's probably the worst sin 
Who wants to be involved with a boring organisation  There are regulations governing how much can be spent during election campaigns 
These vary from country to country and obviously you have to be aware of them and comply with them  Outside the campaign itself however you can spend whatever you can raise 
Money is well spent in setting up and maintaining a properly serviced grass roots party organisation  A good direct mail programme will hold them together and bring their response 
Everyone likes to feel wanted and appreciated and such a group of people will give or raise whatever amount of money is needed  We raised Â£2 million in eighteen months for Luis Palau 's Mission to London in 1984 most of it through direct mail 
In 1979 we began pioneering the direct mail concept at constituency level with my wife Marlies at first typing and then working the word processor and computer  A constituency operation in south-east London was begun at about the same time 
The prevailing idea then among Conservatives was that computers were hi-falutin and impersonal  I never could understand why a letter typed with a word processor was any less personal than one produced with a typewriter 
Fortunately the rumour began to circulate that Disraeli had used a WP and suddenly computers were in  There 's still a long way to go but for both the major parties in the UK computer campaigning in the constituencies is now widespread 
With good software programmes and consistent input a constituency can identify most of its own voters and potential switchers  Incidentally much of the success of direct mail lies in the fact that apart from bills most of the population get no mail at all and people are delighted to get a letter that expresses interest in them concern about them and opens the door for further contact and involvement 
It is not enough to notify the regional chairman or committee members of what 's going on and hope that they will pass on the message to the members and supporters  Remember the party game Chinese Whispers 
The message comes out completely different at the other end  The greater number of people who are well-briefed the wider the cascade effect 
Enthusiasm and commitment radiates outwards until it touches those on the edge of the circle and draws them in  This is the way forward 
A central core of keen and well-informed supporters whose enthusiasm knowledge and confidence will draw new members like a magnet  Anything else is false economy 
Telephone campaigning is an expanding field and one that can be very effective but it is open to misuse you can say almost anything on the telephone and campaigners have to be trained in the right technique  It should go without saying that an approach should be unfailingly courteous 
Never preach hector or bully  The wrong word can do your cause more harm than good 
The telephone can be rather cold as a method of first contact but very useful if it is used in conjunction with a letter or a visit  In fact the strongest impact is always made with three hits 
So for example a letter and a phone call are good but a letter a phone call and a visit even better  This three hits principle applies across the board in communication but it takes effort 
Say for instance you 're holding a press conference and you want to ensure maximum attendance  Send out an initial press notice 
Find the name of the news editor or the particular specialist reporter and announce that you will be holding the conference to make a significant announcement  Follow this teaser with a second release giving full details of who when and where and follow it up again by a phone call checking that the right person has got the material 
Local elections however insignificant they might seem sometimes are actually very important  They affect quite radically the life of a community and they have repercussions that reach up to national level 
Local authorities can spoil or block what a government is trying to do or they can steal its credit  Political units overlap and influence each other 
For example if a local authority is apathetic about the European Community and the single market of 1992 they can effectively stifle interest and ensure a low turn-Out for a European election  Equally an authority that encourages exchange visits by schools business and industry contacts twinning with continental towns and so on can easily raise the level of voter involvement 
In the United Kingdom there is no breathing space no fallow time when a local party can sit back and not worry about politics  Elections of one kind or another are taking place three years out of four parish borough county European 
Contact does not have to be political in fact it can be more effective when it is n't  A visit when someone is sick or an invitation to coffee is far more appreciated and remembered than a call to discuss committee problems 
It 's always the same principle hearts first then minds  A local political organisation needs specific goals and a strategy 
You need a measurable target  If you are having a recruitment drive decide what it is you want 500 members in two years 2,000 in five or whatever 
I remember Billy Graham saying at Earls Court back in 1966 that the Christian Church in England should organise itself like the Communist Party by forming active and multiplying cells fixing a timetable planning a strategy and working it through  I keep hammering away at this point but it applies to so many areas and it 's so rarely done 
Good organisation is specific and detailed not bland and vague  There are two types of supporter in politics 
Those who want to be paid-up signed-up members and those who for one reason or another do not actually want to become a member but are keen to be kept informed involved and used as the occasion demands  SO do n't feel you 've failed if people wo n't sign on the dotted line 
They may turn out to be Of equal value to those who do  Some of the most effective recruitment campaigns I have worked with have been for limited commitment 
Many people want to help but just do n't want to be bogged down with wasteful committee meetings every week for years  To involve people in Billy Graham Crusades we asked for a specific and limited commitment something that people understood and could accept a prayer meeting in their home once a week for five weeks only giving a monthly gift to the Crusade for six months only 
A finite contribution  In local political organisation the technique is just as effective 
By using it in Ealing in West London in 1979 we recruited enough help to win the borough council election and to take the parliamentary seat from Labour  Three hundred extra helpers were recruited to give eight hours help in the three months before the election or two Saturday mornings or four evenings in the final two months 
The local constituency officers got new people and could plan how and when to use them and later many of them decided they 'd like to go on working with their new friends  Supporters of whatever political hue are people first and political creatures second 
So if you approach a sympathetic but so far neutral person and start telling him that he ought to give his support because of x y and z policies he is likely to be bored and irritated  But if you ask him to spare a couple of hours to help out at a St John Ambulance fund-raising activity or a garden fÃªte for the church roof repair fund he might find that a worthwhile thing to do 
When he gets to the event and discovers that the people there are friendly interesting and pleasant company and most belong to the same political party he will begin to think  You 've caught his interest and got him involved by deeds more than words 
In grass roots politics interest grows mostly through non-party political activities  The Labour Party knows this and so do the Liberals now Democrats with their emphasis on community politics 
It might seem little enough to get an extra bus stop or pedestrian crossing but those are real concerns for local people and such matters affect the way they regard you politically  Lord Cockfield a European Commissioner from 1983 to 1988 discussed European publicity with me early in his term 
He said The most effective publicity we 've ever had for the Community is the European Ryder Cup Golf Team  It means something for people to see the top golfers of the different nations playing together 
It says more about the concept of the European Community than any amount of leaflets and party political broadcasts can  I 'd like to see Euro MPs introducing their singers in the Eurovision Song Contest 
Millions of people watch it it involves and amuses them and it 's the perfect forum for effective communication not party political just an idea of Europe  But the best communication is always person to person 
Let me give you an example  You know someone who you believe is a supporter and in conversation it 's mentioned that he regularly gives to charities 
You if you are well informed can then point out that there 's a way in which he can get tax relief on his donations  Take the person the appropriate leaflet and explain the system 
You can see the need for good information to local constituency offices  If you are sent incomprehensible bumf find someone locally who can translate it into readable English 
Your potential supporter is both helped and encouraged to look on your organisation more favourably because someone took time and trouble over him  Once you have got a favourable response you follow through with an invitation to a social event 
Perhaps a letter from the local party chairman saying I 'm interested to learn you are a supporter of ours and I 'd like the opportunity to get to know you  We 're having a short breakfast-time get-together at 8:30 Saturday 
We 'll be serving scrambled eggs toast and coffee free of course and we 'll have the chance to chat  We 'll be through by 10:00 and you may find it interesting and useful 
Do come along  You will not need telling that good relationships with your local press radio and television are essential but how do you do it 
First of all get to know them  Keep a complete list of all the reporting and editing staff on all the outlets in your area 
Try to meet them in non-political situations and when you do not want anything from them  Take a school class or a group from your voluntary organisation to see how the local media work 
Meet them with a local businessman or at other functions  When they know you in a personal capacity you have credibility when you contact them in a political role 
Second never abuse that credibility  Make sure that the story you have for them is interesting and if it is merely constituency information explain that you are providing it for background briefing and that you are not expecting them to publish it 
Many times over the years I have contacted radio or television stations all over the world to propose a client to appear on a show  I have never suggested to the media that anybody goes on a programme unless I know that it will be good radio or good television 
My own professional credibility would be lost in an instant if I proposed a boring twit  On the other hand if the media ask for someone to take part try to make him or her as interesting as possible for the programme not to themselves 
Third make situations interesting  If your candidate is going to research the level of pollution in a local river he does n't stand on the bridge and look he either wades in to feel for junk or he goes in with a professional diver to find it 
In both cases it 's a good story and photo but in both cases make sure your candidate is properly equipped and safely escorted  Candidate disappears under junk in local river is a bigger news story but you lose the photo 
Fourth do n't always do a news release on all the grass roots activities  Sometimes if you plan it it 's worth not reporting a newsworthy event but make sure the local press finds out casually after it 's over 
Then they come to you the third person principle and ask you to make sure they are told of everything in future  Fifth be available 
Make sure that all the local news people have the appropriate office and home phone numbers  And finally organise the volunteers to take part in phone-in radio programmes and write letters to both press and radio 
Do not wait for political discussions  Get them to take part in all the community topics but and it 's a big but their opinions must be genuine 
Do n't plan twenty similar letters on one subject your people lose credibility again  It is wise however to teach them the basics of radio and how to construct an interesting letter 
Advertising publicity and public relations all play a part in effective communication by local party organisations  Advertising is buying space in whatever medium and designing the selling device poster commercial etc 
Publicity is the exposure you get by providing the resources yourself leaflets posters press releases and newsworthy events but the space is free  The leaflet and letter is posted through the door the poster stuck up in the window the story featured in the press 
Public relations or PR is slightly less visible  It is establishing and keeping up mutual understanding between an organisation and the people it wants to reach 
It 's the third person factor  Marketing incorporates all three 
It means recognising or creating a need pointing it out and offering to meet the need with your product or message  What other people say about you and your party has far more impact than what you say about yourself 
We 're getting better at using this third person factor in political campaigning but it 's still not used fully  The reason why party political broadcasts however clever and imaginative rarely have a great impact is because they are still essentially advertising and people know it 
But when you get a senior foreign statesman commenting abroad how much the world respects Mrs Thatcher that 's a real PR coup  EARLY CALL Arrivals and departures can often be dramatic 
I was travelling with President Carter 's press corps in 1980  We had finished a big dinner in Chicago around midnight 
Back at the O'Hare Airport Hilton we were told The President 's gone to bed  Nothing now until 0800 
I fell into bed only to be woken by the telephone an hour later at 1.30am  Airforce One and Two will leave for Washington in one hour please be downstairs in twenty minutes packed 
The President had seen the polls forecasting heavy defeat and had decided on a high-profile last-ditch effort to free the Iranian hostages  It did n't work but we all or rather most of us lost our sleep to fly in Airforce Two 
The following morning six of the travelling journalists showed up innocently for breakfast in Chicago wanting to know where everyone had gone  They had not been reachable when they were phoned in the night 
Governor Dukakis tried a similar dramatic stunt in 1988 holding midnight and early hour rallies for supporters between California and Boston on the last night of the campaign  That did n't work either but it was imaginative and made the supporters feel better 
In a very close race it just might have helped  The same principles work through the grass roots of a party 
If you want to attract people to an event you will get a certain response by direct invitation but a much greater rate of success when your members are saying I 'm going to a terrific do  So-and-so will be there this-and-that will be happening why do n't you come with me 
Once you 've recruited your members and other helpers you must use them and their talents  One of the most important factors in any election campaign is finding out who is likely to vote for you canvassing 
It is a key task for your troops  They must find the information for you to base your strategy on 
And gathering that information means knocking on doors and asking people questions  That awful script Good morning/afternoon/evening 
Have you decided which party you will vote for  Canvassing is usually done with a rather hit and miss approach 
It is left to the individual 's instinct and good sense which are not always entirely sound  A Conservative candidate knocked at the door of a run-down council flat one evening at 7pm 
The door was eventually opened by a scowling man cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth towel around his waist shaving soap on his face and a razor in his hand getting ready for his night shift  The caller stepped back aghast and stuttered I 'm so sorry to disturb you I see you 're changing for dinner 
There is an art to canvassing  Watch for tell-tale body language and gestures and give-away phrases in someone 's response 
If they know which party you are from and say Oh I expect I 'll vote for you they probably mean I wo n't but I want to get rid of you quickly because Dallas is just beginning or I 've no idea and I 'm really not interested politicians are all the same  Rather than marking the person down as a supporter try a follow-up saying Thanks I 'll get a colleague to call round 
If the response is Oh no it 's alright do n't bother it 's fair to assume you ca n't count on his vote  Try to read the feedback and get as definite a picture as you can 
You do n't want to under- or over-estimate your strength  Canvassing is still done without uniformity of approach or agreed method and its results are often badly inaccurate 
Canvassers should have training which could in itself be fun for them  Get some volunteers to come and be canvassed at a buffet supper 
You might even win some supporters  For some of us meeting people is difficult but you do not have to be an outgoing free and easy character in order to learn to meet and get on with new people 
If you are involved with local politics meeting people is going to be part of your task unless you are ready to spend the whole time in a backroom stuffing envelopes  Individually we are very much the same but the circumstances that govern our lives might be quite different 
Politics is about communicating with and winning a person not winning an argument or battering home a policy line  When you first meet someone assume you will meet them again 
Take time to become acquainted  It will take more than one meeting and not all people are equally responsive 
Try to be natural and Objective  You will find it easier to talk to people if you do n't take all their ideas personally 
They have a right to think the way they do  When you know them better by all means invite them to a party meeting but do n't let your attitude to them be dependent on their political philosophy 
As the initiator of the contact the tone of the encounter the degree of relaxation ease and good humour depends On you  If you handle it right your next contact will be easier 
All this is I know easier to say than to do and there are times when everyone feels shy  If you are nervous about meeting new people take a friend with you on your first efforts 
I am considered to be fairly outgoing but as a teenager I was painfully shy  I had to train myself to deal with people and situations and it 's quite possible once you make your mind up 
Involvement with a political party will at some stage inevitably involve meetings  Like most other projects meetings are not difficult to organise if you know the principles 
I discussed them in some detail in the chapter on event planning  There are four main points to remember a clear objective an overall picture of the event meticulous preparation and the willingness to go an extra mile 
Small meetings regular get-togethers of people who mostly know each other are not so much my concern here because they will probably run to an agreed format and be fairly self-contained  But anything of a bigger scale that involves attracting the public or rallying the faithful or listening to a guest speaker does need forethought and care if it is not to be a shambles 
If possible visit your location weeks ahead arrive hours before the meeting so that you can test your equipment and check through everything well before the doors open  Draw up a checklist to include platform design and decoration technical equipment sound and lighting stewards signs first aid arrangements wheelchair space press area guest seating and parking 
Do n't be afraid to add your own items to the check-list every meeting is different  Always have a rehearsal and go through on your own every step 
Check that you have the right information and equipment  Rehearsals save you being embarrassed in the meeting by broken light bulbs out of focus films a speaker half an hour late because he could n't find anywhere to park and shrieks and howls as the public address system does its best to drown the speaker 
Timing is critical many meetings are marred by going on and on  Your audience must know that you finished on time without knowing how you did it 
Plan the schedule as a whole and in detail and write down exact timings  Always finish on time unless there is a very good reason to overrun 
Be flexible with the details so that if you are getting behind you can trim the programme  Brief your participants that you will be conducting the meeting this way and expect their co-operation 
Leave them wanting more is a good piece of showbusiness advice  If people leave feeling it was good but rather long you have failed 
If they leave wishing it had gone on longer you 've succeeded  If you are actually conducting a meeting do it with sensitivity objectivity a cool head and an informal personal touch 
Sometimes you can let the meeting carry on by itself you do n't have to bob up between every item on the programme  One person leading into another can make for a smoother flow and a more efficient use of time 
You 're presenting a message not hogging the limelight  You should never put on your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth 
Henrik Ibsen  On the wall of our dining room is one of my favourite pictures a composite photograph of all of the Roadies team for Mrs Thatcher 's 1987 election tour 
It 's a favourite because it reminds me of the most exciting part of political campaigning the roadshow  That 's where the politicians meet the people and the adrenalin really flows in those exhilarating nervewracking exhausting three to four weeks before polling day 
You 've got your candidate you 've got a date you 've got your strategy and organization and now you 've got to put theory into practice  The roadshow team has to put it all together and win 
In spite of all the technological developments land sophistication and speed of modern communication the point of a campaign roadshow is the same as it was in the days of the whistle-stop tour when politicians addressed voters from the backs of trains to communicate with the maximum number of people in the short time available  Being on the road is the lifeblood of politics and that 's something that these days television enhances because whatever the potential of studio interviews or recorded broadcasts some of the most effective television comes from live campaigning out there 
An imaginative on-the-road campaign involves all kinds of activity walkabouts whistle-stop tours visits to places of interest speeches delivered in market places shops factories farms and building sites  It can cover anything from giving a church sermon to holding a mass rally 
What unites all these disparate activities is that they all help to maximise the impact and outreach of your message to present the person or the party in the most effective way to enthuse and woo the voters  Interest inform involve 
These are the aims  Presentation is a growing profession and business as we come to the nineties 
It is interesting and perhaps unusual that it developed first in politics but now is used more and more in commerce and industry  The explosion of television outlets has been a key factor in this trend 
Isaiah wrote that whenever the Bible as the Word of God was proclaimed it would never return void  In other words the message itself would always have an effect 
Even so it is clear that the most effective proclaimers of the Gospel are those who have learned how to speak and present their message professionally  I would not presume to add anything to the Word of God but I have a sneaking suspicion that if Isaiah had been writing in the 1990s he might have added a phrase 
He might have said for example The Word shall never return void but its impact will be a whole lot greater if it 's presented well  Of course before you start reaching out to others you have to get your own act together 
Mid-term between the 1983 and 1987 General Elections I had lunch with a friend the film producer David Wickes  At the time the Conservatives were low in the polls and within the Party the various political and organisational groups were not yet pulling hard together towards the election 
I mentioned some of the problems we were facing and David asked Harvey do your people actually want to win the next election  As I thought about that perceptive question I realised its implications 
Was the message or the product important enough to present properly  Did the result matter to those of us who were involved 
And if it was important to us and the country why in the world were n't we snuffing out all those niggling grievances and getting on with the job of winning  It 's only when you 've put yourself second and the message first that you can get on with the business of communication 
On-the-road campaigning allows the repetition of a simple theme to different live audiences  This theme illustrated in all kinds Of ways is then thrust home to millions more by television 
The roadshow 's organiser must always keep this larger audience in mind  Those who are not on the spot will get their impressions firstly through television and radio coverage and then through newspapers 
So you must not get bogged down in detail  Remember the importance of the visual image and try to keep your theme unified and simple 
Avoid the detail that could divide and hammer home the principles that unite  There has been a lot of debate in political circles as to whether on-the-road campaigning should tackle political issues or concentrate on displaying the personality of the candidates 
Obviously I 'm not saying that political issues should not be debated  Indeed the political theme for the day should be set at the morning 's press conferences and local candidates and VIPs fully briefed and able to talk about or answer questions on that topic wherever they may be 
What such issues must not do is clog up the wheels travelling communications must have clarity and cohesion  Above all they must have punch 
And beware of flogging an issue too hard  Sometimes it sounds like a good idea to tackle say health or education all through one day on the road in a particular area 
In practice it 's often very hard to sustain  There is after all a limit to the number of schools or hospitals in a town that you can go to without everyone getting bored or the whole business seeming increasingly contrived 
At the end of the day it is the person that makes the impact  A lot of the work in this field is logistical getting the right people to the right place at the right time with the right equipment 
Because time is short you will want to fit in as much as possible without over-reaching yourself  In other words aim for targets that are possible but only just 
Do n't try to cover Berlin Hamburg and Munich or Paris Strasbourg and Marseilles or London Plymouth and Glasgow in one day however good you are with plane schedules and grass landing strips  On the last day of the 1988 American presidential election Dukakis went on a whirlwind tour that must have been dreamed up by a desperate team 
He crossed the country from California to Massachusetts with rallies en route in twelve hours  There should be no need for that 
Use a logical progression or a system radiating out from a central base  It is less demanding on the people involved and offers less chance of something going drastically wrong 
Sometimes there is no special political reason for going to a place  It 's simply that people need to see their leaders and would feel hurt if they believed themselves forgotten 
Of course one must put a lot of effort into marginal seats but in the long term you must not forget the safe ones too  Besides you need to motivate workers in safe seats to go and help in the others 
You must also be sensitive to the special needs and preoccupations of a particular area and its people  Britain is a richly varied country and the politician you are presenting must be well briefed about these local concerns before he or she arrives 
On the other hand you do n't want to get too embroiled in parochial issues if you are hoping to attract national coverage  It 's a question of getting the balance right and doing your homework 
Sometimes the needs of local and national media conflict  The first needs a strong local angle of interest to its community the other something that can hold its own against all the other stories of the day 
It takes skill and judgement and sometimes a compromise is not possible you may have to choose one over the other  I had a difficult time at one airport on a visit during the 1987 election 
The national press and media were travelling on the plane with Mrs Thatcher but the local photographers and journalists were going directly to the airport ahead of time  Once they got there however they found the police would not allow them onto the tarmac with the welcoming VIPs and it looked at one point as though they were not going to get any pictures 
A bit of discreet negotiating sorted it out and the area chairman led Mrs Thatcher over to have a word with the local press on her way to the Battlebus as we called the campaign coach  But if we had not been advancing properly being there just ahead of the main party to iron out any difficulties the result could have been a very serious error in terms of local coverage with potentially unhappy consequences 
When you are planning a schedule you should also bear in mind the location of speeches and statements  Geography is usually irrelevant but not always 
For instance if you are going to be discussing inner city problems speaking about them from a beautiful stately home deep in the heart of the countryside lessens the impact somewhat  Whatever your programme certain basic rules must be obeyed 
They are so basic they seem obvious yet it 's amazing how often they are broken or ignored  First and foremost everyone present at an event must be able to see and hear and the press must be able to see and hear slightly better than the rest without getting in the way of the guests 
Incidentally never forget to plan for the practical needs of the press when you 're drawing up your arrangements  We always provide telephone or fax facilities and try to schedule events to fit deadlines 
I 'd even go a step further than the physical necessities of being able to see and hear properly and say that the audience must be in the right mood too to receive the message  The candidate must not be hidden in or by the crowd at the same time he must not appear too remote 
If you put someone on a second floor balcony for instance to deliver an address it looks as if he is simply haranguing his listeners  In the Portuguese elections of 1984 where I was an adviser it was quite a problem it had always been done from the second floor so I suggested the flatbed truck concept that had been so successful in Malta 
I campaigned there in 1981 for Eddie Fenech-Adami  He is now Prime Minister but was then Leader of the Opposition 
The rallies were wonderful affairs  For most of them the arena was formed just by swinging a huge articulated truck across one end of the street 
The street then became the stadium and the custom-built truck opened out into a full stage with a public address system railings lights flags party backdrop and seating all built in  Although it looked completely different it was this truck that gave me the concept for MiniMag the 27ft 8m articulated truck that we used for Mrs Thatcher 's open-air meetings in the 1987 election 
We used to drive it into fields or parking lots and open it up to reveal a complete Conservative campaign stage  It had everything we could think of lights PA system lectern and its own generator 
The slogan at the back of the stage could be changed so that the appropriate place name could be inserted according to where we were  It meant we could have a sophisticated presentation platform literally in the middle of nowhere and people came from miles around for these outdoor meetings 
There were occasions when we could n't use it instead we had to rely on our improvisation skills  Once we did not know where the Battlebus was going to stop during a tour of Suffolk until minutes before it arrived 
In that short interval we managed to grab a couple of milk crates and a door that we found at the edge of a building site  We stapled a piece of blue baize around the door and hey presto there was a neat little portable platform which we could produce when the time came looking incredibly efficient 
Another day we had an open-air meeting in a field by a river near Southampton Airport  My helpers borrowed an old flatbed truck from a farmer along with two dozen squared bales of hay which they arranged as steps leading up to the truck 
They then commandeered a battery operated amplifier and two loudspeakers from the local constituency association and via the roof of one of their cars set up an excellent PA system  By the time the guest arrived in the field there was a platform made of wooden beams and corrugated iron a vantage point for the press and the necessary amplification 
Everyone enjoyed the pleasant outdoor atmosphere and setting without having to forfeit convenience  I think they thought those structures had been there forever 
LATE ARRIVAL You must always be ready to think on your feet  In Eddie Fenech-Adami 's final rally in Malta in 1981 we had the old stadium in Valetta 
A capacity crowd of 40,000 turned up  We expected sabotage from the Labour extremists and hired two 100,000 watt generators in case the electrical sub-station was cut off 
As it turned out the problem came not from the Opposition but from our own side  After a one-and-a-half-hour pop concert the political programme began 
We had all the leading Maltese Nationalists to speak not to mention two former Italian prime ministers  All we lacked was Eddie Fenech-Adami 
We tried frantically to reach him with our walkie-talkies but he was somewhere en route from the island of Gozo  In desperation I said to Noel Buttigieg-Scicluna Secretary of the Maltese Nationalist Party Noel please go up and make a speech until we can find Eddie 
Noel ran onto the platform and said The last ex-Italian prime minister 's speech was so good I 'm going to repeat it in Maltese to make sure you do n't miss any of it  And he did 
He finished just as Eddie arrived  We swung into the Brotherhood of Man 's special theme tune and turned all the spots on the stadium entrance 
We just saw Eddie 's tiny figure coming through the entrance in an open Land Rover before we collapsed in hysterical relief  Incidentally the Maltese have a delightful habit of carrying their political leaders by hand over the heads of the crowd 
I once saw Eddie travel nearly half a mile like that  It 's not quite as effective as walking on water but it comes close 
You can not see the bearers until they are right by you so the effect is of the person floating on air as he passes along the heads of the crowd and leans over to shake hands  It 's not however very practical for most countries or most politicians 
I mentioned the vital importance of site visits in the conference section but it applies equally in roadshow campaigning  You must visit every spot ahead of time to plan what you are actually going to do on the day with your candidate or leader 
Of course having worked out this wonderful plan you will probably have to create another one on that day because of some unforeseen circumstance  I was recently involved with a stone-laying ceremony for a new school 
We checked out the site a week beforehand  The field lay alongside a road in a London suburb and we thought that people could stand on the road and look across six metres into the field to the platform where the ceremony would take place 
On the day however we discovered that the level of the field had dropped by two metres  Thousands of tons of earth had been moved as part of the site development 
There was absolutely no point in having two hundred people perched up on the road looking down on the top of a marquee  In three hours we managed to get the contractors to build an earth ramp roll it flat cover it with gravel and put a handrail alongside so that people could walk down from the road to a flat area beside the ceremony site 
A colleague said Now I know what it means to move mountains  At times like that you do your initial planning only to find that everything has changed and you have to fly by the seat of your pants 
Nonetheless start out with a master plan and wherever possible use it  Because you need to get maximum use of your time in an on-the-road campaign a last minute change even a small one can have immense repercussions 
It can even jeopardise the whole operation  During the 1987 election we set a carefully timed an organised arrival at a particular airport 
The seventy strong press and media corps were in the rear of the Prime Minister 's plane and we had arranged a special area and platform for them in the terminal  That way they would get excellent pictures of Mrs Thatcher as she moved through the crowd 
For this to work though it was absolutely essential to get them to their spot a minute or two ahead of her and to achieve that we had arranged for Mrs Thatcher to pause for a cup of coffee with the VIPs in a small room just outside the terminal door  The object was not to provide refreshment but to hold up the party for two or three minutes in order to get the press into position 
Unfortunately for our timing one of the hosts suddenly said I 'm sure you do n't want any coffee Prime Minister you 've just come off the plane  Let's go straight through 
And with that took Mrs Thatcher 's arm and led her off  The result was chaos 
There was no way the press could catch up let alone get in position ahead  The airport became a free-for-all with the journalists charging after Mrs Thatcher battling to get a good shot and knocking people in the crowd over in the process 
That mix-up caused us serious problems for the rest of the campaign because we had to be constantly reassuring the media that we would get them good positions  Because they had been confused and upset early on in the campaign they found it hard to relax and trust us 
When I talk about positions and opportunities for pictures I do n't suggest that you can plan them all  Part of the presenter 's role is to watch for good photo opportunities as they arise spontaneously in the course of events 
Obviously situations like the airport arrival can be worked out ahead of time and you can plan how best to accommodate the media for such moments but it 's equally important to spot new potential and make the most of it  Do n't try and set up something that is quite patently false 
Everyone will be embarrassed and it rarely helps  At the same time on-the-road campaigning will produce its own moments so you have to know your candidate and know your location 
You can not for instance turn someone into a surfing champion just because he 's at the seaside but if it turns out that he has a genuine interest in fishing and some skills as a fisherman you can centre pictures and film on that  Because it 's genuine it looks good 
When you are looking for such opportunities however beware of allowing visual images to blind you to potential problems  For instance we were making a film about how well a particular local authority was doing and we were planning to shoot the thundering morning turn-out of dozens of heavy cleaning trucks at five o'clock in the morning 
It turned out that all the big trucks were Volvos so in order to keep things British we had to confine our film to little electric dustcarts  Not nearly so visually impressive but essential content-wise 
By the way always make sure you 've cleared all on-the-road activities with the necessary authorities  You do n't want your brilliant impromptu inspiration to get you into trouble 
Sound as well as visual image plays a big part in successful campaigning applause off-the-cuff conversations speeches music and cheering  And spontaneous ad-libs are great as long as they 're properly rehearsed 
Remember people are interested in people not politics and the best campaign moments are those with a human touch  At the same time allow for human frailties 
The person you depend on can lose his or her nerve about something which seems straightforward like presenting a bunch of flowers or offering a cup of tea  All can seem well till the last moment 
Then they see the size of the crowd or the famous VIP arriving and they are overwhelmed with terror  I remember going to a fruit and flower market in Leeds very early one morning during a tour and one of the staff was going to bring a cup of tea and a bacon buttie to Mrs Thatcher 
In the end the man became so nervous that I had to hold his arm and literally steer him through the crowd to the right spot  Because of the mystique and maybe the image celebrities and VIPs are quite daunting to those who usually only see them from a distance 
I 'm not quite sure why  How often I have heard the amazement in someone 's voice You know he actually wanted the loo 
Human after all  Security is a major headache these days 
It means for instance that you can not announce the whereabouts of major political figures in advance which makes your presentation via the media even more crucial sometimes they are the only people you can take into a particular venue  Even where you have more flexibility such as constituency campaigning by local candidates you may still need to choose your audiences and visitors carefully 
And you have to be careful that there are not so many policemen round your VIPs that the real people the public do n't get to see them  There is no national police authority in the United Kingdom as there is with the FBI in America for example 
Each of our forces is autonomous and has a different approach to security  You have to liaise with them on policy and practicalities 
ECHO FROM THE PAST In 1980 Marlies and I spent three days travelling with Senator Edward Kennedy in his motorcade during the presidential primary campaign  We were with his secretary in the car immediately behind the gun car a huge open station wagon with six secret service men wearing bullet-proof jackets and with the most vicious looking automatic rifles at the ready 
All the motorways were cleared and our sixteen car motorcade cruised down the centre of the freeway at 6Omph  The next day Kennedy was addressing a meeting in a black church in Los Angeles 
As he began to speak a young boy ran straight through a plate glass window behind us at the back of the church  The glass exploded with a loud shot-like crack 
It was seventeen years after President Kennedy 's assassination twelve years since Bobby 's but the idea was so powerful nobody turned to look at the shattered window or the stunned lad  Every eye was on Edward Kennedy 
Had he been shot  There was no need for anyone to say the words 
The pastor spoke first It 's all right  The Senator is not hurt 
Only then did everyone turn and pay attention to the boy and the window behind them  In 1985 in Washington DC I was responsible for the security co-ordination of eleven prime ministers and twenty other Conservative party leaders from around the world who were there for the International Democrat Union Party Leaders ' meeting 
I worked with the FBI the US Secret Service the thirty-one diplomatic groups and the individual protection teams  There were fascinating differences of approach from the White House to Paris from Oslo to Bonn from Tokyo to Canberra 
At first I had visions of an OK Corral shoot-out at High Noon between dozens of different security forces who did n't know each other but in fact we worked it out and there were no serious problems  One of the effects of this increased need for security has been to strengthen the importance of the big set-piece occasions like rallies where access can be controlled and crowds organised 
An election rally must inspire enthuse and excite and radiate these qualities out through the media  The atmosphere must be right in the arena and the whole event must be properly produced and co-ordinated 
Individuals doing their own thing does not work as Jacques Chirac found out at a 1988 Paris rally  There was lots of very French glitz and glamour and an apparently unlimited budget much of which had been spent on giant television screens and clever use of lights but it was all quite impractical and unco-ordinated 
Nobody seemed to have a clear objective in mind and the speakers had obviously not been briefed on what to expect  Some basic rules were broken 
Most of the 25,000 audience in the Palais Bercy could not see the platform because of the enormous scaffold bridge built across it for the cameras  The bridge was too high for a good angle anyway and the fact that it blocked the view of so many meant that the atmosphere never developed properly so that the cameras had nothing convey 
It was a vicious circle  Politics were allowed to intrude too much in fact they spoiled the rally 
Chirac had to be seen to be making concessions to his defeated rival Le Barre in order to get Le Barre 's support for the run-off against Mitterand  So both men were given almost equal prominence and Le Barre virtually killed off any audience interest with a heavy speech 
Chirac did n't even know where to go while Le Barre was speaking on an empty white platform with no chairs and when it was his turn to speak he had no chance of a good clean start because he had to shake hands with Le Barre as they passed on the stairs  It was a study in how not to do something and it cost Chirac dear 
However back to roadshow campaigning and an important innovation Gofers  I introduced the concept to this country during the 1987 General Election in an attempt to overcome one of the major difficulties facing campaign organisers getting consistent standards of presentation 
Up until then it had been virtually impossible  Local staff or voluntary workers can not be expected to have the resources time or experience to ensure that telecommunications backdrop crowd flow music lighting and camera positions are available at the right time and in the right way 
Travelling teams of Gofers can  A Gofer is not the little squirrel-like animal of the American Midwest although there is a certain behavioural resemblance but an abbreviation of Go-for a coffee Go-for a piece of string etc 
Actually I originally decided to call the teams Oyus as in Oi you go for some coffee  We recruited a team of twenty-five young executives whose firms or colleagues gave them three weeks paid leave for the election campaign 
It 's a concept I adapted from the American presidential campaigns  We 'd had a huge rally of 10,000 people for Ronald Reagan at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas and I was flying on to Los Angeles with one of the co-ordinators the next morning 
I asked him how long he had been with the Republicans and he said Three weeks I 'm a sales manager and I 've been given leave of absence by my company just to produce last night 's rally  Our 1987 Gofers were terrific 
They were invaluable to our road campaign and it was a great and new experience for them  We had barristers and solicitors merchant bankers sales and advertising executives a restaurant manager researchers a public relations officer a textile broker and farmers among the team 
Their average age was about twenty-five  They had to be ready and able to do absolutely anything from greeting a minister off a plane to cleaning drains from handling the press to guiding the helicopter down to its landing site with hand signals 
Because they were already in successful careers they were able to learn fast and by the second week our Gofer teams were veteran roadies  We needed a Gofer to drive MiniMag around the country and I asked if anyone could drive articulated lorries 
One girl volunteered with confidence and handled the vehicle without trouble during the campaign  I was a little concerned though when the makers of MiniMag asked what experience she 'd had of articulated vehicles and she replied I 've spent my life driving Daddy 's horse-boxes 
On another occasion we were meeting the Prime Minister 's plane at Cardiff Airport with only two Gofers in the team that day  We had lost the press buses and one of the Gofers a merchant banker came up to me on the tarmac to ask if I knew where they were 
The man standing by my side said that he had seen them behind the terminal  Our Gofer a young woman grabbed his hand before I could say anything and said Great show me will you and dashed off with him in tow coats flying 
We would have actually liked to have told her that the man was the Secretary of State for Wales and a member of the Cabinet  Still they returned safely with the press buses 
Four minutes later I had another nervous moment  I asked her to meet the press off the back of the BAC One-Eleven as it came to a stop in front of us 
She shot off looking up at the plane underneath the tail and far wing and back again  As a successful merchant banker there was no reason for her to know where the back door was in a BAC One-Eleven and that the tail opened downwards with the stairs 
By the last of the three weeks the Gofer teams were performing brilliantly  They had learned the principles and techniques necessary to focus all the attention onto the VIPs and to make it easy for presenters audiences and the news media 
The use of Gofers in 1987 was a successful pioneer effort  They were the right sort of people talented and with some experience and willing to get their hands dirty 
Efficient management of the political parties in the nineties can not carry permanent numbers of young professionals whose talents are so necessary in major campaigns  The Gofer concept provides good mobile flexible staff help just for the times it is needed 
It gives valuable experience to the Gofers which is usually translated into a more effective contribution to their own work when they return to it  And it allows companies both to contribute to and benefit from election campaigns 
I want to take the Gofer idea a little further here based on a primary principle of presentation  A sales pitch a campaign of any kind an annual general meeting must never be produced by the VIPs the candidate or the sales team themselves 
They must be presented minded and mollycoddled if necessary so that they concentrate totally on their own performance  Unfortunately senior executives often either consider that no-one less senior than themselves can be trusted with knowledge of a meeting or that the meeting is so important that they alone are significant enough to occupy the chair 
This is merely routine arrogance but it obscures from them the fact that they could impress everyone a lot more if they could do a better job and with a bit of help they could  If you are pitching for an account appearing on television or radio making a significant speech always have a company Gofer with you 
This is never extravagant  It is just an extension of on-the-road campaigning 
Consider this scenario which I see consistently two or three times a year  You and your colleagues arrive to present a pitch for an advertising account 
You are going to use a video and some slides on a little portable projector  You are following two other companies and the last one is moving their equipment Out as you come into the room 
CAR PHONES Mobile phones have changed on-the-road campaigning dramatically and for the better  I wonder how on earth we worked the 1979 and 1983 elections without them 
At one point in 1987 I was bowling up the M6 talking to a colleague in London on my hands-off Cellnet phone it had a microphone in front of me on the visor  My assistant Joanne Barker was talking on her phone and two more colleagues were in the back seat on their phones 
When my own hand mobile rang Joanne answered I 'm sorry Harvey 's on his other line and our three phones are all occupied  Could he call you back 
He should be free by Wigan  All at 69mph on the motorway 
I hope the caller was impressed  I certainly was 
Another time in the 1987 election we were driving along a dual carriageway in Norfolk heading for an airport to meet Mrs Thatcher 's plane and join up with the Battlebus  We thought all was well until the Battlebus passed us at full speed in the opposite direction 
Since both of us were going to meet the same plane one of us was definitely going the wrong way  We telephoned from our mobile to theirs probably at a combined speed of 100mph going away from each other and it was indeed us who were hotfooting it away from the airport 
We made it on time just thanks to our car phones  A final story about these phones 
Joanne had handled the set-up of the press conference in Glasgow and I had gone on to Newcastle Airport to meet the plane there  Early fog had cleared and the airport manager and I were standing on the tarmac lining up the motorcade when my car phone rang 
It was Joanne on Mrs Thatcher 's plane at Glasgow Airport  The pilot has just said we 're diverting to Teeside because of the fog at Newcastle we 're taxiing out now she said 
I relayed the message to the airport manager who rushed to the control tower just in time to contact the pilot and air traffic control to say that Newcastle Airport was open and all was OK  That 's good on-the-road or on-the-tarmac thinking 
Confidently you open your portable projector and put it on the table  Then it hits you your power line is n't long enough and you have n't checked the video and TV if they are there at all 
The table is a five-metre boardroom piece  You ca n't move it 
You ask for an extension lead  There is n't One 
You ask for a chair and four telephone directories and rig up an impromptu table near the only plug and ask all your prospective clients to turn their heads around  Someone gets strangled in the wire and pulls out the plug 
Your concentration and your confidence has been lost  You are sweating and grubby 
Your chance of the contract has gone along with the picture from your video cassette  What you needed was a Gofer someone who had nothing else to do but look after you and your team 
He would have checked your equipment in advance brought extension lead and table checked the video on that particular TV and set it all up while you were shaking hands and making conversation rather than getting flustered  When you came to make your presentation he would even have put a glass of water within reach in case you needed it and operated the equipment for you 
That 's what I mean by attention to detail  Good Gofers can save face time and trouble and allow you to make an impact 
Above all campaigning must be fun for watchers and participants  It should be different out of the ordinary exciting 
I suppose that the common denominator in on-the-road campaigning is the commitment it requires especially from the volunteer workers in the constituencies who make the biggest sacrifice  They have to keep the rest of their work and life going as well as helping the Party 
Their reward is often in the hands of those of us who are campaigning professionals  In this instance the objective is not just a winning result it is also to leave the volunteer workers with an awareness not only of their importance but of the value of the contribution they have made and how much they are appreciated by the roadies and the candidates passing through 
A pig and a chicken were walking together and they saw a huge sign advertising scrambled eggs and bacon  Awful is n't it said the chicken 
Listen said the pig for you it 's just an offering for me it 's a real sacrifice  Advice is seldom welcome and those who want it the most always like it the least 
4th Earl of Chesterfield  In 1980 I set out to change the face of political presentation in the UK and to use some of these new concepts and techniques in business and industry as well 
With a lot of help from other people I believe we 've done just that  Much of the time the principal performers were not even aware of what we were doing for them 
But today a decade later the art and profession of presentation is recognised as an essential strategic ingredient for making an impact in communications  Success in this field is going to become even more important as we move into the 1990s and beyond and I hope that in this book I 've been able to give you the benefit of my experience to pass on the kind of backstage know-how that can make that vital difference between winning and losing 
But I also hope I 've done something else  I hope I 've given you the motivation and confidence to go out and develop your own personal communication style to its full potential 
I leave you with my ten basic commandments of presentation  As Sherlock Holmes said to Dr Watson You know my methods apply them 
TEN COMMANDMENTS 1  See yourself as you really are 2 
Know your objective 3  Have an overall picture in mind before you start on all the details 4 
Work out your route plan 5  Rehearse 6 
Take your audience by the hand and lead them along with you  7 
Win hearts then minds 8  Keep it simple 9

Family planning and soil conservation programmes a comparison  Of course arable land in some places is going out of cultivation because of erosion and other destructive forces 
But taken as a whole the amount of arable land in the world is increasing year by year  Simon 1981 81 
This view forcibly made by Simon claims that land is like any other resource which far from being finite as for example the Club of Rome world models assumed Meadows et al.  1972 Mesarovic & Pestel 1976 actually becomes cheaper and more plentiful as technology finds and creates new resources and uses existing ones more efficiently 
In this context soil degradation exists but taken as a whole is unimportant  The more technically advanced agriculture becomes the smaller is its dependency on natural endowments 
A similar opinion is expressed by Beckerman 1974 239â€“40  As regards the physical limitations in food supplies there seems to be general scientific agreement that this does not constitute the real constraint the vague counter argument that more intensive cultivation will ruin the soil is hardly convincing in view of the fact that soil has been farmed with increasing intensity in Western Europe for about 2000 years and there is still no sign that it is exhausted 
Most of the world 's cultivable areas are by comparison either hardly touched or not yet touched at all  Nor does the need for more fertilisers for purposes of modern agricultural methods pose any problem as there are ample supplies of phosphates and potash 
As regards the physical limitations in food supplies there seems to be general scientific agreement that this does not constitute the real constraint the vague counter argument that more intensive cultivation will ruin the soil is hardly convincing in view of the fact that soil has been farmed with increasing intensity in Western Europe for about 2000 years and there is still no sign that it is exhausted  Most of the world 's cultivable areas are by comparison either hardly touched or not yet touched at all 
Nor does the need for more fertilisers for purposes of modern agricultural methods pose any problem as there are ample supplies of phosphates and potash  Although addressing a different problem Ruttan 1982 along with Boserup 1981 both put forward the idea of induced innovation as the means by which research and development of agricultural technology is directed to address appropriate problems both by the state and farmers themselves 
Ruttan cites the contrasting examples of the USA and Japan  In the USA where labour was the scarce resource it was the process of mechanisation first with animal and later tractor motive power that facilitated the expansion of agricultural production and productivity by increasing the area operated per worker while in Japan where land was the scarce resource it was progress in biological technologies leading to increased responses by varieties of paddy to higher levels of fertiliser application 
In both cases a process of dynamic adjustment to changing relative factor prices was achieved and the appropriate innovations induced successfully by these implied price signals  Ruttan believes that new agricultural technology and new institutions to develop it will be induced into existence to meet the challenge 
Therefore he places emphasis on the importance of each country ensuring that factor prices reflect scarcities thus ensuring that new technology will always develop in the most efficient market-led directions  However he does not consider either the costs and returns to different groups in society nor different regions of the world 
Furthermore the issue of environmental degradation as a result of induced innovation is hardly given any attention at all  Boserup on the other hand gives explicit attention to environmental degradation but in such a way as to suggest that in some cases soil erosion actually induces desirable agricultural innovations 
In her most recent book 1981 50 she gives examples where the destruction of topsoils in the reaches of a watershed through population pressure leading to destabilising agricultural practices had induced intensive agriculture in the valley floors which had been fertilised by the removal of topsoils further up-valley  She quotes examples of environmental deterioration in China for example which started to be acute between AD 1500â€“1750 and which induced long distance transport of night-soil labour intensive digging of river silts widespread terracing and recycling of residues and wastes 
The ability of modern technology to cope with the problem of soil erosion is summarised thus Growing populations may in part have destroyed more land than they improved but it makes little sense to project past trends into the future since we know more and more about methods of land preservation and are able by means of modern methods to reclaim much land which our ancestors have made sterile  Boserup 1981 22 
Although these four authors address themselves to rather different problems and do not appear to agree on a number of issues their combined views on the importance of soil erosion are more or less consistent and quite clear its importance is exaggerated agricultural technology initiated by both officials and farmers can respond satisfactorily and the resources at disposal are massive and are constantly being created by technology itself  This view is in complete contrast to those who maintain that environmental deterioration is widespread and of critical importance 
So contrasting is it that one may wonder whether its adherents are looking at the same thing at all As the eighties unfold humanity faces a worldwide shortage of productive cropland acute land hunger in many countries escalating prices for farmland almost everywhere  Brown 1981 in an article entitled Eroding the basis of civilisation 
Two more quotations of many hundreds serve to make the point that the distance between the two views is so large that they are probably not going to be reconciled by proof or disproof of the physical evidence  There is an environmental nightmare unfolding before our eyes it is the result of the acts of millions of Ethiopians struggling for survival scratching the surface of eroded land and eroding it further cutting down trees for warmth fuel and leaving the country denuded 
Eckholm 1976 77  Effects of soil erosion in every degree of intensity can be found in Latin America ranging from ravaged mountain slopes of the Andes to incipient dust storms in rangelands of the Argentine Republic 
According to preliminary estimates twelve of the southern countries have been damaged by severe erosion to the extent of about 70 million acres out of some 140 million acres of land now in crops  In six of these countries Chile Colombia Ecuador Honduras Mexico and Venezuela the estimated amount of land mined or severely damaged ranges from about 50 per cent to more than 60 per cent of the area appraised as arable Bennett 1944. 63

In six of these countries Chile Colombia Ecuador Honduras Mexico and Venezuela the estimated amount of land mined or severely damaged ranges from about 50 per cent to more than 60 per cent of the area appraised as arable Bennett 1944. 63  A study of a remarkable set of documents put together by USAID the administration for foreign aid given by the United States during the past few years entitled Environmental Profiles one for each country shows in considerable detail the extent of soil degradation alkalinisation salinisation waterlogging and desertification world-wide 
Almost every nation in central and Latin America Africa and South East Asia seems to be suffering from environmental decline and although the basis of quantification might be questioned at least there is the framework of a sub-regional quantified data base on environmental decline  Also references in this book to the extent of soil erosion are drawn from a wide variety of sources and go some way to corroborate the view that whether it is important or not environmental degradation is certainly happening 
Thus we do not intend to provide evidence here of frightening rates of soil loss and desertification throughout the world  Eckholm 's book 1976 does this more than adequately and less recent accounts e.g. Jacks and Whyte 1939 Hyams 1952 have also documented what has been seen as a widespread and serious problem 
The view taken here is that one can produce quite easily a catechism of doom supported with prodigious rates of soil loss over millions of hectares and some examples are given in this book  However attention is instead directed in this chapter to an ideological examination of the question of whether all this matters and if so how and to whom 
The view that will be taken is that it does matter very much although not quite in the way in which previous writers about environmental doom have envisaged  The rest of the book addresses itself to developing this approach 
There are two interrelated issues about the rules of discourse on the subject  The first is that of proof 
What constitutes proof and is it possible  In other words can Beckerman or Simon on the one side or Eckholm or Lester Brown on the other as examples of leading protagonists be proved wrong 
The second is related and is a question of ideology and at a more applied level one of politics whether environmental deterioration matters depends not only on proof but also on one 's view of social change and development  Let us start with the problem of proof 
The most pervasive characteristic of measurements of soil loss at different points throughout the world is their scantiness  In a review of the present situation of soil degradation in ten countries of the Near East Rafiq 1978 9 states that in most countries only qualitative information is available a view which Stocking 1978a shares with reference to Africa 
The UN Conference in Desertification 1977 177 also agrees Statistics are seldom in the right form are hard to come by and even harder to believe let alone interpret  We can identify a number of interlocking and mutually reinforcing reasons why the situation prevails 
First there are few resources in developing countries to measure soil loss  Quite sophisticated equipment and trained manpower is required to make reliable estimates 
Furthermore measurement has usually to be made over a period of time  Compared with the measurement of alkalinisation and salinisation whose samples of soil can be easily gathered at one point in time and the electrical conductivity of saturation extracts gauged the measurement of soil loss is more demanding 
Second the range of data required tends to be demanding for example see Skidmore 1977 and Skidmore Fisher and Woodruff 1970 for the sophisticated data needed to assess wind erosion  Usually the physical data on soil loss has to be combined with a fairly detailed knowledge of land-use and its history if the man-made contribution to erosion is to be reliably estimated over large areas outside carefully laid-out experimental plots in research stations 
Then there is a group of more technical reasons which make statistical modelling and extrapolation more difficult and inhibit attempts to overcome a shortage of resources for direct measurement by statistical estimation of soil losses  There are problems related to the complex and varying manner in which symptoms of soil erosion appear through time 
Douglas 1981 summarised the time-dependent effects of soil eroding land-use practices in terms of changing soil erosion soil nutrient status soil induration weed invasion and crop yield as well as upon the impact on rural incomes and the rural population  It is clear that the timing of these impacts varies enormously between cases and that long time periods are required for some impacts to emerge 
Furthermore simple measurements of sediment at a point represent only the net result of all the processes going on upstream  The measurements do not identify the spatial nor temporal source of sediment 
The sediment volume measured could have resulted from a long past phase of forest clearance in an upstream catchment or a more recent event in a completely different location altogether  In addition the scale of measurement over which soil erosion occurs affects the measurement itself 
As Gardner 1981 points out in relation to the FAO/UNEP World Assessment of Soil Degradation mapping exercise FAO 1979 Riquier 1978 1982 the universal soil loss equation has been misapplied in the estimation of soil erosion in quite large territorial units  In all but the most uniform of plains the spatial anisotropy of soils vegetation and topography is such that at a scale of 1:5 million that of the FAO/UNEP maps a single meaningful measure of the parameters is not possible 
Gardner 1981 2 General problems of the use and misuse of the universal soil loss equation are discussed by Wischmeier 1976 and Stocking 1978a these contribute to the difficulty and extrapolation particularly over large areas implied by the scale of the FAO map  The scale of measurement also affects the estimation of soil erosion because as it becomes smaller the problem of redistribution of eroded material within the areal unit becomes more serious 
Erosion may be very considerable but because the area of net measurement of soil movement is large sedimentation may occur within the same unit and therefore net erosion is estimated to be small see also Blandford 1981  Further the relationship between erosion and crop or livestock yield have not been reliably modelled 
There are separate models for erosion processes and others for crop growth processes but the link between the two sets tends to be under-explored Dumsday & Flinn 1977 Amos 1982 Ch. 2  For example erosion rates in a vertisol will have very much less of an impact upon yield than in a granite sand 
One attempt to model only critical variables which determine yield has been made by Stocking and Pain 1983 where they concentrate upon the impact of erosive forces upon the availability of minimum moisture levels  Finally the question of proof about soil erosion demands that natural and man-made or enhanced rates of soil loss can be distinguished 
Partly this is a matter of time and related to the first problem discussed above  Only a marked increase in erosion rates coupled with evidence of changes in agricultural practice and/or extent of agriculture might in these cases provide sufficient evidence of accelerated erosion 
It has been recognised how difficult it is to attribute accurately the effect of humans on soil erosion Stocking 1978b 130 because of the uncontrolled nature of many other crucial variables such as climatic change  Therefore it is difficult to interpret such statistics as those of UNEP 1982 as well as others which calculate rates of topsoil loss per km 2 except perhaps in cases where the rate is extremely high and where there is other evidence of obvious changes in land use 
Statistics quoted at length in UNEP 1982 have shown the amount of land converted into lower classes of production relative to previous periods by soil degradation and erosion  UNEP ibid. shows that all classes of cropland are predicted to increase in area up to the end of the millennium but that large quantities of land most certainly concentrated in marginal environments will lose productive capacity 
In the same report UNEP 1982 265 it is claimed that the total area being reclaimed by irrigation is probably about the same as is being abandoned through salinisation alkalinisation and water-logging and that these problems account for the loss of about 2â€“3 million ha of the world 's best agricultural land each year  The assessment of the seriousness of soil erosion is frequently done on the basis of the percentage reduction in yields as well as or instead of objective physical measures of changes in properties of the soil e.g. Rafiq 1978 36 
Tolerable soil losses inevitably involve political issues as well as technical ones such as the natural rate of soil formation or the T factor as calculated by the USLE Universal Soil Loss Equation developed by the Soil Conservation Service of the United States  In any case there are considerable technical problems in assessing the T factor which is defined as the maximum rate of annual soil erosion which would permit high-level crop production to be maintained indefinitely Schertz 1983 
Cook 1982 argues that the measure is political and moral without much rational basis and credibility  At this point the discussion shifts to the question of ideology in assessing the importance of soil erosion 
The central issue here is the assumptions about future agricultural technology which are made when assessing tolerable soil losses  Potential productivity losses are masked by new technologies such as chemical fertilisers and improved crop varieties Halcrow Heady & Cotner 1982 254 
If such advances are to be made and put into practice by the people working the land then higher soil losses can be tolerated  The degradation of many soils such as those in East Anglia England to the extent that they are scarcely more than a physical retention medium for chemical fertiliser and moisture Kirkby 1980 does not have the same social and economic impact as degradation of soils where the land users do not have and may be predicted not to have in the future the resources to make good the degradation by the application of massive doses of fertiliser see also Heathcote 1980 Rennie 1982 
However even in advanced capitalist countries the economic effect of degradation and erosion may not be negligible  Pimental et al. 
1976 have estimated that erosion has reduced the production potential of American cropland by 10â€“15 per cent and that an estimated 5 gallon equivalent of fuel per acre is being used to offset past soil losses which amounts to about 4 per cent of total oil imports in 1970 p.153  In summary four crucial questions to be raised in discussion of the positions of Simon Beckerman and Ruttan are as follows 
a  Will future agriculture and pastoral technologies be induced which will protect fragile and/or eroded environments or compensate land users for productivity decline due to environmental degradation 
b  If these technologies are developed will they be accessible to current land-users of these areas 
c  Is there any evidence now of a and b occurring in the way that Boserup and Ruttan have indicated and that they will continue into the future 
d  What level of soil erosion need occur before appropriate legislation is implemented and appropriate agricultural and pastoral technologies induced 
Will future agriculture and pastoral technologies be induced which will protect fragile and/or eroded environments or compensate land users for productivity decline due to environmental degradation  If these technologies are developed will they be accessible to current land-users of these areas 
Is there any evidence now of a and b occurring in the way that Boserup and Ruttan have indicated and that they will continue into the future  What level of soil erosion need occur before appropriate legislation is implemented and appropriate agricultural and pastoral technologies induced 
So it can be seen that what was originally a technical question of the definition of tolerable rates of soil loss is a crucial and deeply ideological one and therefore not amenable to the cut-and-dried standards of proof on empirical grounds  However let me put a view which though not provable is perhaps persuasive even if persuasion is the lowest form of proof 
The belief that agricultural technologies will be developed for marginal ecologically fragile areas and for the marginal poor farmers and pastoralists that live there is it will be argued a trifle heroic  The examples of induced innovation in Japan and USA responding to the different and changing relative factor prices are the best available 
Induced innovation did occur for these great and developing nations because it was central to their national development and they both had particularly advantageous social and natural endowments at the time  Simply there was money to be made in research and development both public and private in these strongly growing economies 
Of course these nations induced appropriate agricultural innovations  The development of the Green Revolution is another case in point 
This was undoubtedly a breakthrough of major significance but it was developed with particularly strategic and world political objectives in mind the containment of communism by increasing food production and the reduction of US food-aid were major impelling factors  It provided unparalleled opportunities for transnational companies manufacturing chemical fertilisers pesticides tractors and pump-sets to sell their wares to a vast new market 
Now the issue here is not whether this was good or bad the motive humanitarian or base but that it had a tremendous impact upon the agriculture of the Third World at least in Latin America South and South-east Asia  An excerpt from Lester Brown explains these opportunities which the Green Revolution offered multinational corporations 
Given the pre-eminence of the multi-national corporation in international development it is surprising that it is accorded so little attention in development literature  Although there are occasional highly publicised instances of expropriation foreign private investment is growing rapidly 
According to the Survey of Current Business American private investment abroad totalled $17 billion in 1930 and had reached only $19 billion in 1950 but then began to climb rapidly to $50 billion in 1930 and $87 billion in 1966  Thus far only a small fraction of overseas investment of multi-national corporations has been allotted to agribusiness in the poor countries but the amount is increasing 
Sales of farm inputs and opportunities for new investment in food processing and related activities are increasing in the poor countries in close relation to the acreage planted to the high-yielding varieties  Brown 1969 64 65

Sales of farm inputs and opportunities for new investment in food processing and related activities are increasing in the poor countries in close relation to the acreage planted to the high-yielding varieties  Brown 1969 64 65 
The access of farmers of lesser developed countries to this package of new inputs as is now abundantly clear was limited  It was the larger farmers who gained in practice although there is still disagreement over why whether seeds and fertilisers are scale neutral but other inputs are not or whether high yielding varieties HYV 's are less robust and larger farmers have the necessary economic and political power to control growing environments better 
However the creation of a new agricultural bourgeoisie in almost one of every country of non-communist lesser developed countries as a result of the Green Revolution has assured a self-generating demand or induced innovations of a particular type which encourages both larger surpluses and mechanisation  This growth of biological and mechanical agricultural technology may also have benefited small farmers and the landless but only incidentally 
In other words it was not the demand signals of the small farmer and landless that generated the research development and diffusion of the Green Revolution technology but the interests of large multinational companies and strategic considerations of the United States of America  The crucial area of debate centres upon whether the signals from ecologically fragile and marginal areas will reach institutions and governments so as to induce appropriate innovations for those areas 
While relative factor scarcities may have provided the required signals where there is a lucrative profit to be made it is not the case for fragile areas and the small farmers who live there  Very frequently the signals from large farmers and highly productive areas lead to competition for resources with those from small farmers and relatively unproductive areas 
It would be wrong however to dismiss completely advances in productivity-enhancing research which can be applied to steep-sloped and marginal areas  For example in Caquezo and Rio Negro in Colombia corn and potato yields have improved 200 and 90 per cent respectively on hillside farms which were able to adopt the improved technology Sepuldeva 1980 although this example was only on a limited scale 
In Jamaica the use of hillside ditches and contour mounds produced sustainable yields of 38 t/ha/p.a. and reduced soil loss to 17 t/ha/p.a. while traditional cultivation methods only yielded 26 t/ha/p.a. with a rate of soil loss of 134 t/ha/p.a  Sheng & Michaelson 1973 
Ruttan 1982 also distinguishes from productivity-enhancing research another type called maintenance research defined as the research needed to prevent yield decline as a result of the evolution of pests and pathogens the decline in soil fertility and structure and other factors  This quotation is one of the very few places in his work where he actually mentions soil erosion 
There are a number of reasons why maintenance research is less attractive than productivity research in general and particularly so for marginal areas  Maintenance research tends to be undramatic unglamorous and only missed when it is absent 
It also may bring much lower returns both economic political and in a bureaucratic framework promotional than spectacular breakthroughs in irrigated rice or wheat for example  In the case of ecologically marginal farms inhabited by politically marginal farmers maintenance research is doubly unattractive 
Some of these possibilities are hinted at by Ruttan in an earlier paper 1981  However the title of this paper restricts reference to developed countries only but even here the normative suggestions about distortions to prices of factors and outputs leading to inappropriate signals to research institutions seem to amount to little more than wishful thinking 
Political dialogue is required and a dialectical interaction at the economies ' political level between research scientists research planners research clientele and the legislative process is required and hoped for  His article outlines the failure of research programmes in Argentina Peru and Colombia during the last fifty years p.27 but does not explain it or help us to find a way round the problem 
By far the greatest part of maintenance research developed by institutions of state for marginal areas has been soil conservation techniques outlined in Ch. 5 which as this book shows have had to be imposed by colonial powers to be induced at all  However certain aspects of maintenance research for eroded areas remain characteristically neglected 
For example Spears 1982 states that little research has been done on the cost of rehabilitation of severely eroded hillsides  It is at present very expensive in the order of $US500-$US 1000 per ha and low cost methods have not been developed 
Other examples appear elsewhere in this chapter  Of course farmers and pastoralists themselves have developed their own and usually effective methods of soil and water conservation which they had evolved themselves and suited their own social relations of production and ecological conditions but which had been disrupted by the colonial experience see Ch. 4 for examples 
Referring principally to those techniques of soil conservation developed by research stations and government institutions many studies of the economics of soil conservation which focus on the private economic incentives for soil conservation show that although total benefits from a soil conservation scheme such as terracing may be more than the total cost individual farmers usually lose income from these practices Harshbarger & Swanson 1964 Holtman & Connor 1974  Ervin and Washburn 1981 have shown that even with very favourable combinations of a low discount rate a long planning period and a high level of individual cost sharing private incentives are very seldom sufficient for the individual farmer 
In a difficult production situation with high perceived discount rates and competition between small producers for many scarce resources it is obviously an unanswered question as to who will pay for conservation works or how cost-sharing or insurance will be arranged on a sufficiently large scale  Productivity-enhancing research and development in many lesser developed countries have often been harmful where they have been accessible to farmers of those areas 
The introduction of monoculture maize which replaced nutritionally and soil conserving mixed-cropping strategies in Africa is one example  Belshaw 1979 illustrates the contradiction between research station agronomic techniques which favour planting crops in pure stands and inter-cropping techniques which are by far the most satisfactory from the point of view of the reduction of soil erosion 
Pure stands allow accurate control of the plant population and mechanisation of weeding and harvesting an implicit big farmer bias is evident here  They allow effective and profitable fertilizer and pest/disease control treatments which can be calculated more easily 
They are congruent with the principal objective of increasing output of one crop often for export and consumption in urban areas rather than one to enhance the farm system as a whole  They stand for modern improved and mechanised farming as opposed to indigenous and backward farming and so on 
While there are many other advantages of inter-cropping than soil conservation this type of crop planting technique is neglected and has been systematically eliminated in many lesser developed countries see Beets 1982  In the same publication as Belshaw 1979 there are some other interesting examples of the deleterious effects of exogenous technologies upon indigenous ones in lesser developed countries many of them with strong implications for soil erosion particularly Swift 1979 and Richards 1979 
Even within one crop varieties are often introduced in an attempt to maximise yields but succeed only at the cost of decreasing soil protection by foliage at times of heaviest rainfall David Gibbon personal communication  The emphasis of almost all research and development carried out at research stations and economic studies for national agricultural strategies as well is upon particular commodities isolated from their social economic and environmental context 
Farming systems research which studies the complex of decision-making by farmers as a whole system implies that the researcher spends time with the farmers rather than in the research station and adapts research needs on the spot in the farmers ' fields to ongoing work by the farmers  The problems that arise from the development of a new crop on a research station and the attempts to recreate it in economically and environmentally diverse farms outside can in this way be avoided CIMMYT 1980 Biggs 1981 
Environmental protection can easily be built into adaptive research and becomes just another important but related consideration in induced innovation  But it is just this sort of research which is hardly being practised at all with a few exceptions Conyers 1971 Okigbo 1981 and a bibliography on farm systems by Gilbert Norman & Winch 1980 
However adaptive research is rather demanding upon scarce skilled manpower and it also requires researchers to live for long periods outside the comfort and orderliness of the research station itself  For this reason alone it is not very popular with private state-sector research institutions 
Instead it is single cash-crops which attract most research developed outside the context of the production situation in which small farmers in steep-sloped and ecologically fragile areas find themselves  Thus the introduction of many cash crops particularly peanuts coffee cotton and maize into ecologically fragile areas has had disastrous effects and some of these are analysed in Chapters 8 and 9 
The existing biases of research and development are well known and include big as against small farmers bias cash crop as against subsistence crop bias maximum average yield as against maximum yields in bad years irrigable as against dry land crops and higher yields per unit as against higher yields per worker  Innovation is induced very healthily along the lines of these biases as Ruttan suggests but not along those enabling small farmers and pastoralists to maintain or transform their livelihood in areas of highest environmental vulnerability 
Three pieces of evidence noted by Posner and MacPherson 1981 fn. support these arguments  First The World Bank estimates that between 90 and 95 per cent of public investment in agriculture since World War II in Mexico and Peru has been in irrigated agriculture and practically none in watershed management 
Second the major impetus for colonisation schemes in Colombia Ecuador and Peru was not to solve the problems of the pressing needs of the hill areas at all but to increase aggregate agricultural production and reduce rural-urban migration without causing political upheaval as a result of land reform  Third a flat-land bias in research stations in tropical America is very marked 
So far research has focused almost exclusively upon export crops such as sugar bananas cotton and beef and products consumed in urban areas to the neglect of inter-cropped maize beans potatoes and barley  Also most land classification systems put a ceiling of 10â€“15 per cent slope for annual cropping thereby diverting researchers ' attention away from the problems confronting hill farmers 
The next part of the discussion moves away from research institutions to farmers and pastoralists themselves and concerns the accessibility of new agricultural technology to these people  Yield-enhancing innovations are usually the only ones available through the network of state institutions 
However these can only be taken up by larger farmers with access to credit with a lower vulnerability to the risk that the innovations imply and with the economic and local political power to assemble all the necessary physical inputs together in time  If these new inputs had been in a form that small farmers in marginal areas could practically use it could be hypothesised that the resulting extra incomes would encourage soil-conserving investments and would take the pressure off farmers to over-exploit the environment 
However as Chapter 7 explains yield enhancing innovations particularly concerning cash crops both tend to exacerbate soil erosion and accelerate differentiation of the peasantry see Ladejinsky 1969 Griffin 1974 Pearse 1980  Other examples of applications of high energy technology to agriculture and stock-rearing such as deep boreholes in semi-arid areas are discussed by Cliffe and Moorsom 1979 and Kassapu 1979 where it becomes even more difficult for those with dwindling resources to avail themselves of soil conserving and yield enhancing new technologies 
An atomised peasantry of small farmers is one of the least attractive and the most difficult target populations for state-sponsored innovations even if they are appropriate  First small farmers are many while bigger farmers tend to be few 
Second they do not seize opportunities for credit and new inputs while large farmers are frequently able to look after themselves even without the aid of extension agents  Small farmers too have limited room for manoeuvre to adopt new technologies 
The rural sociological literature of the 1960s of the diffusionist school has demonstrated to the point of overkill the problem of the laggard and the small farmer Rogers & Shoemaker 1971  Environmental decline further limits small farmers ' and pastoralists ' ability to accept externally generated innovations 
This vicious circle is more precisely specified in Chapter 7  Internal or autochthonous innovations the sort which Boserup 1981 discusses under conditions of population pressure do of course occur and her book gives many examples 
However it is striking that discussions of the state of relations of production and patterns of surplus extraction are almost completely absent  Without these crucial areas of explanation her theory of how innovations occur or do not occur seems remarkably fragile 
There are a number of processes which reproduce themselves through time and which keep poor farmers in perpetual poverty and force them to use their natural environment in non-sustainable ways  These processes excepting that of population growth are largely unexplored 
While there are local adaptations of agricultural and pastoral practice to conserve soil these processes ensure that they are usually not far-reaching nor fast enough  The necessity for speed in adaptation of agricultural technology exists because of these self-reproducing and self-reinforcing processes fairly rapid population growth political and economic neglect of marginal environments except where they can be exploited for the production of commodities for the national and international market and a stagnant production per unit worker and area for the majority of the population 
The last symptom may seem tautological but in effect it is self-reinforcing  Once levels of savings and the ability to risk innovation decline sometimes exacerbated by malnutrition and food shortages at critical points in the agricultural calendar the necessity to do something about it becomes all the more urgent and difficult 
Adaptations do occur and the ability of peasants and pastoralists to adapt their systems of resource management are often impressive e.g. Wilken 1974 Brokensha et al.  1980 Denevan 1980 Beck 1981 
To give a brief example in Nepal population pressure has in the last decade or so brought about many intensifications of cropping patterns such as the introduction of wheat as a winter crop  More rapidly maturing early paddy allows an extra crop of maize to be harvested in irrigable fields double-cropping of paddy on irrigable fields is now commonplace and inter-cropping of squashes and beans in maize fields is being introduced 
But the pace of population pressure and the failure of fuel supplies current demand is 546 kg per caput of firewood per year and the maximum sustainable yield at present is 80 kg have reduced the fertility of the soil the supply of perennial irrigation and drinking water and increased the rate of sheet and gully erosion Banister & Thapa 1981 87â€“94  Whether it is a matter of a lack of knowledge on the part of indigenous cultivators and pastoralists that leads to excessive and untimely tillage the use of improper implements the destruction of crop residues by burning and so on is a moot point 
While FAO earlier reports 1960 1965 1966 and others cited in Ch. 4.2 put these practices down to ignorance there are many examples where knowledge is not the scarce factor but the resources to put this knowledge into practice  My own experience in Morocco Zambia India and Nepal is that there is an enormous variability in people 's perceptions of environmental decline 
Some see it and have sound explanations like one Magar lady in rural west central Nepal who gave a ten-minute lecture to me on the problems of the transference of fertility from forest to arable land and changing uses of crop residues with increasing population pressure that would have stood up well in a graduate seminar  Others in the same country seem to have little notion of what is happening e.g. Bajracharya 1981 from eastern Nepal 
Certainly no generalisation can be made except that the successful diffusion of the knowledge of soil conserving practices is often one essential change that is required even although the knowledge may be possessed by some cultivators already  Usually as this book will argue successful agricultural extension is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for implanting sound conservation practices see Thrupp 1981 for a case study of the jaded peasant view of conservation in Costa Rica 
Solutions to population pressure differentiation and declining productivity through soil exhaustion and erosion which lie outside the agricultural sector altogether do not offer the same promise as they did in Japan the USA or the United Kingdom during their industrial revolutions  Outmigration to cities in search of menial jobs or part-time work in nearby plantations provide remittances and reduce food demand but these activities also reduce labour availability and have been responsible for the collapse of old-established terracing systems in the Middle and near East particularly Yemen and also in the Andean part of Peru and Colombia 
In some ways these experiences both alleviate the problem as well as reproduce it since it enables some outside income to prop up a failing agricultural economy postponing either abandonment of the area and/or more radical transformations  It is argued in this book that in many areas of the world where environmental fragility is an outstanding characteristic there is a failure to adapt to a variety of new and related pressures particularly population pressure and increased state intervention which is often extractive in nature and also that such technically state-sponsored innovations that there are tend to be inappropriate or inaccessible 
Thus there are twin reasons for this failure to adapt in these areas  The first is from outside concerning the State and the second from inside in that the inhabitants can not adapt their own technologies fast or radically enough to maintain an increase in their incomes nor can they find a solution elsewhere by migration and a secure source of income outside the region altogether 
Consider now Simon 's remark 1981 84 that  even such persons who worry about the lost of land as Erik Eckholm acknowledge that it is in our power to have more land if there is a will to work for it 
Today the human species has the knowledge of past mistakes and the analytical and technical skills to halt destructive trends and to provide an adequate diet for all using lands well suited for agriculture  even such persons who worry about the lost of land as Erik Eckholm acknowledge that it is in our power to have more land if there is a will to work for it 
Today the human species has the knowledge of past mistakes and the analytical and technical skills to halt destructive trends and to provide an adequate diet for all using lands well suited for agriculture  To whom is the word our addressed 
The argument made in this book is that it is not to all land-users  Neither is it a question of working for it nor to put it the other way that people do not have more land because they are not prepared to work for it 
They are excluded from using more land and they often work onerous hours on the land which they do own for a pittance  Lastly to talk of the human species fails to differentiate between people whose circumstances are very different 
The approach in the opening quotation is the same as that taken in this chapter taken as a whole  Here we would never maintain the whole is suffering environmental decline but that parts of it are and this matters to the numerous people living there 
Aggregates tend to appeal to comfortable analysts  There is a further sense in which a lack of access by land-users renders the aggregate view very questionable 
So far the political and economic aspect has been emphasised but there is also a spatial one  There are barriers to a free movement of people from areas of high to low population pressure 
Some of these can be expressed as a distance-decay function and indeed costs of migration may largely be a matter of distance as in the case of outmigration from island economies such as are found in the Caribbean or Oceania others are political and virtually insurmountable such as national frontiers  The case of India and Nepal is a case in point 
Population density on the Nepal side of the terai is four times that on the Indian Gaige 1975 but the physiography and soils are similar on either side of the border  Another example is highlighted by some extraordinary satellite pictures published in Glantz 1977 6 7 showing the difference in vegetative cover and population pressure both human and animal between the Republic of South Africa and Lesotho 
Moreover the creation of political boundaries in the Sahelian countries during colonial and post-colonial times has actually contributed to the disruption of a carefully regulated system of pastoral movements and pastoral-agricultural symbiosis leading to environmental deterioration and desertification Franke & Chasin 1980 Ch.3 & p.98  Policy-makers and commentators in many countries of the world have often assumed that small farmers and peasants in mountainous and/or environmentally degraded areas will abandon their hillside plots if given other opportunities elsewhere so that the state by various means can ease population pressure on steep slopes by encouraging or at least not inhibiting colonisation of new areas 
In fact hillside farmers tend to be very attached to their farms  In many cases they have through time been attempting to subsist on farms that have become progressively smaller without becoming more productive 
However they have consistently opted to eke out a living by temporary migration and wage labour rather than leaving in such numbers so as to exceed natural population growth and thereby ease the pressure  Colonisation schemes in many tropical American countries for example have also proved to be extremely expensive e.g. $US6000 per family in Bolivia Curtis 1979 as is also the case of Indonesian policy of migration from Java to the outer Islands see Booth & McCawley 1981 for detailed accounts of the failure of these schemes 
The traumatic effects of resettlement whether as a result of dam projects or a state-sponsored attempt to relieve population pressure often reduce the ability of the settlers to adapt satisfactorily to their new environment  In other cases there is land to spare and at the same time extreme population pressure plus unequal landholdings such as in Brazil where there is a constant stream of immigrants to the marginal lands of the North-East and to Amazonia 
These migrants are either middle or large farmers who can obtain credit for farming on very easy terms from a variety of government institutions and in the hyper-inflationary economy of Brazil easy credit amounts to a free gift of capital  Then the immigrant purchases a large tract of land and farms it without any expenditure on soil conservation often without chemical or organic fertiliser until yields have declined and degradation or erosion has set in 
He then abandons his farm raises new loans and moves on  Other immigrants are less fortunate and have very little capital 
For them there is frequently a cycle of desperate and under-capitalised farming followed by failure through drought or poverty-induced disease and malnutrition with another enforced move to take more land into cultivation while the land under previous cultivation erodes or reverts to unproductive grazing land Gilbert 1974 Deutsch 1977 343 f. Johnson 1978 Grainger 1980 16  The same process may also be happening across the border in the North East Oriente of Ecuador Hiraoka and Yamamoto 1980 
However these examples of Andean countries Brazil and Indonesia are all ones where there is land still available  Colonisation either planned or unplanned and removal of population pressure are simply not possible at all in small sea- or land-locked countries e.g. in the countries of the Sahel Lesotho Swaziland Rwanda Burundi or the islands of Oceania 
In any case large-scale planned colonisation schemes have a very low success rate  The last point about the relationship between farmers themselves and their natural environment concerns the production and preparation of food including the cooking of it 
Here again it is a matter of ideological assumptions and the unit of study  Trends in food production by continent for example show an increase except for Africa FAO annual publications entitled The State of Food and Agriculture 
Here the level of aggregate production even at the national level in many cases is not the problem and I agree completely with Simon and Beckerman 's repudiation of neo-Malthusianism and the Club of Rome 's doom-dominated world model  It is widely recognised that it is not production of food but the low level of demand for food that is the problem for many and for varied reasons related to the forces and relations of production in which people are involved 
A combination of vulnerable classes or groups living in vulnerable and ecologically marginal areas in many cases causes a failure to create sufficient income for food to feed themselves  Again it is as Sen puts it the tradition of thinking in terms of what exists rather than in terms of who can command what Sen 1981 8 quoted in Redclift 1982 1 which ignores the vital question of access to food production and the fuel to cook it 
As Agarawal 1980 150 in terms of wood fuel puts it in the same way as Sen it is not a simple technical problem but  It is a problem of poverty and political economy 
It is an issue both of absolute shortages of the wood and the distributions of available wood supplies between different uses and users its causes are seen to be closely linked to the distribution of economic and political power between classes and social groups which determines who gets how much of a scarce resource  It is a problem of poverty and political economy 
It is an issue both of absolute shortages of the wood and the distributions of available wood supplies between different uses and users its causes are seen to be closely linked to the distribution of economic and political power between classes and social groups which determines who gets how much of a scarce resource  Many groups of people suffer from stagnant or falling rates of both food and fuel production alongside others who have very significantly increased theirs 
This is also reflected in an aggregate geographical sense where whole areas suffer from this problem while others have markedly increased their share  Here a hypothesis on regional differentiation sometimes coinciding with social differentiation is attractive although it is very difficult indeed to provide data to support it 
Areal data will not suffice by themselves since it is quite possible for aggregate areal food production to increase in such a way that increasing numbers of people have difficulty feeding themselves  Also areas may refer to a few kms 2 or to whole countries so that areas or pockets of declining food production may coexist with and have no social access to other areas of increased food production 
In these circumstances soil erosion is potentially of utmost importance to the livelihood of these vulnerable people even if it is not happening at present  As we shall suggest later the relationships in which the inhabitants are enmeshed often encourage soil degradation and erosion in fragile environments which has the effect of a vicious circle and makes it even harder for transitional and progressive technical and political changes to be made 
In the words of Gallopin and Berrera 1979 They the poor may be forced to destroy their own environment in attempts to delay their own destruction  A similar view is put by Allen 1980 29 
Eckholm 1982 identifies a global underclass produced and reproduced by social relations of inequality which is an indictment in itself but which also causes environmental problems across a wide range not only soil erosion but also urban pollution and disease  The ways by which this class comes about and the implications and feedback effects to and from the natural environment are discussed in Chapters 6 7 and 8 
Three brief case studies illustrate the related issues of population growth without significant outmigration stagnant production poverty of most of the people of the area concerned and environmental decline  The first is Rwanda where given conditions of rapid population growth and limited natural resources Rwanda faces a number of serious environmental problems USAID 1981 p 
V  Deforestation overgrazing and shortened fallow periods threaten the fragility of Rwanda 's soils 
One illustration of the extent of the damage is that in the Eastern Plains where domesticated animal off-take is 900â€“1300 kg/ km 2 that of the wild ungulate biomass in unspoilt areas of a national park is in the order of 15,000 28,000 kg/km 2  Population pressure on land has led to increasing competition of less sensitive rotations which maximise the production of food crops with beneficial rotations which include nitrogen-fixing crops and forage crops 
An agricultural revolution of major proportions is required involving widespread and costly irrigation reafforestation land management practices including agricultural diversification and erosion works otherwise an annual population growth rate of 3 per cent and an economic infrastructure which can not make productive use of the growing population will precipitate a major crisis and also accelerate soil degradation  Fig. 2.1 illustrates these points 
If farms remain the same size as now 1  1 ha all farmland will be saturated by 1995 at a population of 5.7m. marked 4 on the diagram 
But existing mean farm size is too small for a vigorous self-sustaining take-off which was estimated to be possible at a minimum farm size of 1.8 ha  Under these conditions saturation has already occurred in 1977 at a population of 3.8 m. marked 5 on Fig 2. 1 
Increasing failure to grow enough food on the part of farmers leads to a decline in productivity through a lack of energy and malnutrition particularly at times of peak labour demand and an attempt to substitute less soil-conserving crop rotations  The second case study is Swaziland 
Tables 2.1 and 2.2 from Roder 1977 tell a sombre story  Efforts to reduce stocking densities have met with little success due to the significance of cattle as a source of wealth and prestige rather than a source of income IBRD 1977a Doran Low & Kemp 1979 so that herd size has actually increased between 1968â€“77 in spite of government efforts to reduce it this being discussed further in Ch. 7 
The last example is situated in tropical Latin America and is taken from Posner and MacPherson 198 1 1982  The proportion of the national area of thirteen tropical American countries described as steep sloped is very high 80 per cent for Honduras Panama Haiti and the Dominican Republic and not less than 50 per cent for eleven of the thirteen 
Also these steep-sloped areas are very important contributors to the national total production of foodstuffs as well as fibres and export crops particularly coffee  Many of these areas also suffer from extremely serious soil erosion although reports and impressions seem to differ 
For example Eckholm 1976b estimated that 77 per cent of El Salvador had severe erosion and Low 1967 estimated that 87 per cent of Peru was losing more than 10 t. /ha/p.a. of topsoil  Baldwin 1954 states that 42 per cent of Mexico had accelerated erosion and so on although as section 1 of this chapter suggests it is difficult to know how to gauge the significance of these figures except in a general and qualitative way which indeed may be sufficient 
Posner and MacPherson 1981 show that staple crop yields have tended to decline Blasco 1979 or at best remain stagnant CEPAL 1976  Population growth in the steep-sloped areas of these countries is expected to increase by the year 2000 by between 40 and 59 per cent in many areas e.g. Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras 
The resulting situation is therefore very serious both in a national sense since these areas contribute significantly to food and export crops and also in a regional sense since erosion population pressure and poverty will probably increase given existing trends and national priorities in research and investment  These examples do not prove a case but they help and there are many well-documented cases in which a variety of factors combine to produce evidence that erosion is important to land-users and to the national economy and that neither research and development nor local adaptations in agricultural technology will provide answers to these problems 
Lest the reader may point out that the examples so far are predominantly drawn from small countries and affecting only small populations others such as areas of China and India are discussed elsewhere in this book  Soil degradation and erosion is caused by the interaction between land use the natural characteristics of that land and its vegetation and the erosive forces of water and wind Stewart 1970 
The focus of this book is upon the social element but not to the exclusion of the physical parameters  Clearly any case of soil erosion must be the result of this interaction and any ceteris paribus assumption about these physical parameters would be absurd 
The central question asked is why certain land-uses take place  Why are no soil conserving practices a part of the on-going development and change of land-use practices and why are adaptations to conserve the soil not sometimes made 
The answer to these questions lies in the political-economic context in which land-users find themselves  The analysis must start therefore in areas which initially may seem remote from the physical processes which directly cause degradation and erosion 
One of the main problems in the discussion of the political economy of soil erosion is that it is difficult for author and reader alike to span the great variety and complexity of circumstances both physical and social under which soil erosion occurs  For example much of the foregoing discussion was making the point that soil erosion was important to many small producers in steep-sloped and/or semi-arid areas and it may have seemed that these people were the only ones to cause and suffer from the effects of soil erosion also that there were few or no cases where successful adaptations and advances in agricultural technology had occurred 
Clearly this can not be the case  Therefore generalisations made in the course of the book usually must be qualified heavily by such convenient disclaimers as sometimes or under certain circumstances 
So that some of this variety can be displayed in a simple fashion at the outset a listing of different political economic contexts under which soil erosion occurs is given below  Lists are not meant as explanations although there is sometimes an implicit taxonomy and even theory in a list and the theoretical starting point of this book emphatically does not lie in this list 
A cursory examination shows that the items on the list are not mutually exclusive and thus the criteria used for compilation are mixed and also not mutually exclusive  The main purpose of the list is to illustrate complexity and variety of political-economic and physical circumstances of soil erosion 
The principal criterion used in the identification of different social elements in soil erosion is the relations of production under which land is used and these are more carefully specified in Chapters 7 and 8  a 
Soil erosion and degradation can occur in peasant and pastoral groups  Here family labour is employed usually under the direction of a senior and usually male member of the household and production is primarily for use rather than for sale although the latter may be economically essential 
Some of these groups may be relatively undifferentiated although considerable inequalities in access to land pasture and family labour power usually exist  Other important variables which qualify the impact of these relations of production upon the lives of these groups include the availability of land whether there is population pressure under the existing production technology and the degree of interference by the state by way of taxes conscription price fixing rural development projects and so on 
b  There are also peasant and pastoral groups that are characterised by marked differentiation where a considerable proportion of the means of production is owned by another class altogether 
They can be hacienda owners where feudal relations with workers on the hacienda may still exist or capitalist entrepreneurs either owners or managers for very large corporations and transnational companies  The social roots of soil erosion under these circumstances are more complex 
They derive from both the operation of large units often highly mechanised and characterised by monoculture and high energy demands sometimes supplied from local sources and the small peasantry itself which has to work for part of its income on larger enterprises  The latter often are pushed off the most suitable land for cultivation and are forced to make a living cultivating steep slopes or pasturing animals on a reduced amount of land 
c  Soil degradation and erosion also occur in centrally planned economies where decisions are made to use land in a non-sustainable manner 
This arises from a number of causes  A Bolshevik and it might be argued a Marxist ideology in which man 's mastery over nature is essential in the rapid development of the forces of production is central here 
Also there has tended to be in earlier Soviet writing a sort of radical cornucopianism which has provided the ideological context of some technically disastrous decisions on the use of land  Consider this stirring quotation and its possible ecological implications 
We must discover and conquer the country in which we live  It is a tremendous country referring to the USSR but not yet entirely ours 
Our steppe will truly become ours only when we come with columns of tractors and ploughs to break the thousand-year old virgin soil  On a far-flung front we must wage war 
We must burrow the earth break rocks dig mines construct houses  We must take from the earth 
Burke 1956 quoting from The Great Plan 1929  Pryde 1972 draws attention too to the assumption of Marxian economics but not perhaps all Marxian economics that only labour produces value and therefore that land water and all associated resources are considered free inputs in production 
This has led to some very unfavourable repercussions of natural resource use for example the extension of wheat production into Kazakhstan under President Khruschev  However ideology apart there is considerable evidence of a degree of senior bureaucratic bungling and the suppression of scientific reports which would have been embarrassing to the senior members of the bureaucracy if Komarov 1981 as the chief informant is to be believed along with other writers such as Cherenvisinov 1964 Goldman 1972 or Kirby 1972 
It is difficult to sort out blatant public relations exercises from virulent anti-Soviet propaganda  Although every ideology forms its own criteria and language of evaluation it is doubly difficult to be discriminating and to carry through a particular form of objectivity when reading accounts of conservation in socialist or socialist countries 
The inverted commas here indicate that there is considerable debate about which countries can be called socialist  A reading of Pryde 1972 or Tregubov 1981 simply is not factually consistent with that of Komarov 1981 
Here one suspects that there is not so much a clash of ideology as one of gross distortion  d 
Erosion also occurs in advanced capitalist countries  Here farms are privately owned either by owner-operators or larger corporations wage labour is employed and the product is grown for the market 
Usually agricultural technology is closely linked to that of industrial technology and is constantly innovating as private farms strive to remain competitive  The direction of the technology is one of control over nature yield maximisation and at the same time reliability of quality control over yields and harvesting dates as a whole it responds quickly to the needs of the market 
Land use itself also quickly adapts to price signals and the economic margin of cultivation can therefore change very rapidly  However if farms remain profitable yield-increasing technologies tend to mask the effect of soil degradation and erosion and make up for declines in fertility that would have occurred if land had been cultivated with a constant level of technology

There are a large number of other contingencies which crosscut these four political-economic contexts and modify them  Indeed the existence of soil degradation and erosion is contingent on an enormous variety of human and physiographic variables and it is probably impossible and counter-productive to attempt a single theory of soil erosion 
Instead this book attempts to theorise substructures in a theory of soil erosion  A number of contingencies discussed below are illustrative and not exhaustive 
Rural population densities are of prime importance in modifying the implications of the different relations of production under which land is used  Frontier areas with low population densities attract particular kinds of exploitation of natural resources 
Large logging operations for the export of timber or to supply local plywood pulp and construction industries frequently do not bear the costs of ensuring sustainable yields and often mine the natural biotic resources of areas and then upon their exhaustion move on see Ch. 8  The phenomenon of the hollow frontier has been common where settlers cultivate land which is virtually free to anyone with the capital and/or labour to exploit it and move on when serious erosion sets in leaving behind eroded soils 
In the history of the settlement of the United States the first white settlers in north America arrived in Virginia in 1607 and by 1685 there was a serious increase in flooding caused by forest clearance  With rapid depletion of fertility in the Tidewater land many settlers moved onto the Piedmont where they mostly repeated their mistakes 
The expansion of settlement soon became based on a hollow frontier as settlement moved west leaving a trail of erosion and siltation behind until by 1939 Charles Kellogg felt that 75 million acres 28 million hectares of this 450â€“500 million acres/180â€“200 million hectares of eroded land were too worn out to return a living wage under any system of farm practices  Kellogg 1941 
Similar settlement histories have occurred in the Gangetic plain and Doabs of northern India Schlich 1889 187â€“238 and Brazil up to the present day  High population densities on the other hand may modify the way in which the land is used under given social relations of production and indeed modify the relations of production themselves 
Where there is no further land for settlement and for people to set themselves up as independent farmers or pastoralists there is an added reason for a land-controlling class to emerge firstly because land hunger tends to differentiate a peasantry and secondly there is no alternative for those without enough land but to work for others  However high population densities are certainly not a prerequisite for inequalities and a class structure to arise 
Although population pressure is the most common attribute of these peasantries and pastoralists there are many cases where declines in population through outmigration or apocalyptic disasters e.g. Latin America during and after the Spanish Conquest Boserup 1965 62â€“63 have led to a coarsening of agricultural technology a labour-saving cropping pattern and an allocation of labour which can encourage soil erosion e.g. Bunyard 1980 for Palestine  However in these cases too it is the economic relations which farmers have with other more developed economies that cause these problems 
The nature of the state in which land-use occurs can also modify the broad classification outlined  The type and degree of infrastructure such as roads and storage facilities institutions such as banks agricultural extension development projects fiscal and monetary and pricing policy the legal structure of land tenure and of environmental protection and conservation the state 's degree of intervention in international imports and exports all these are part of an explanation of soil erosion 
In the analysis of all specific cases of agricultural technology crucial aspects which may lead to soil erosion can not be read off in a vulgar materialist sense from the relations of production under which they are applied  First of all there may be contradictions between the social relations of production and the agricultural technology used therefore at a particular moment in time technology and social relations may seem out of adjustment 
For example a semi-feudal landlord in a developing country today may employ a large number of retainers or family servants who will work for cash rent labour rent or a proportion of the harvest on his land  This arrangement is an important part of the social relations of production 
However that same landlord may be introducing tube wells tractors and high-yielding varieties of seeds and therefore wish to get rid of the large number of inefficient workers to whom he may be partly responsible for housing clothing looking after their aged or sick and also to whom a sizeable proportion of the additional benefit from these improved inputs would accrue  This is a contradiction between relations of production and technology 
To take another example peasants often form reciprocal labour groups to cope with periods of particularly high labour demand e.g. paddy transplanting or preparing plots for burning in the forest for shifting cultivation  However many of the more advantaged peasants either in terms of household labour power control over land or number of bullocks for ploughing might like to grow crops for the market 
A change in crop mix perhaps also in crop planting technology and field preparation has strong implications for soil conservation but the additional inputs required particularly of labour put strains on the reciprocal labour arrangements  Here again we have a contradiction and a society in transition e.g. for India Saith and Tankha 1972 
In short there is a dialectical relationship between agricultural technology and relations of production  That potent and overworked word dialectical can be explained after Howard & King 1975 21 in the following way 
the main idea is that social phenomena are seen as existing in relation to each other and continually developing in and through such relations so as to form at various phases contradictory forces that generate qualitatively new formations  Thus social reality is seen always as in a state of becoming something else 
the main idea is that social phenomena are seen as existing in relation to each other and continually developing in and through such relations so as to form at various phases contradictory forces that generate qualitatively new formations  Thus social reality is seen always as in a state of becoming something else 
The second reason why a simplistic relationship between agricultural technology and relations of production can not occur is that there are frequently many important local variations in technology which can only be uncovered by detailed analysis of settlement histories and cultural development  The path which an agricultural society will move through history particularly with regard to the development of its agricultural technology is determined by a highly complex reality 
Relations of surplus extraction population growth and the relevant characteristics of the environment are only three sets of variables amongst many others  Further development of Boserup 's thesis is required to uncover the reasons behind environmental degradation on the one hand or successful intensification of land use on the other for a review of some of the major issues see Brookfield 1982 
In conclusion there is a wide variety of social and physical contexts of soil erosion  The social relations of production under which land is used is a key and pervasive element in the explanation of soil erosion it also goes some way to explaining the nature of the state which intervenes and influences the use of land in all sorts of ways 
However there are many cross cutting contingencies which have to be analysed fully in an explanation of any concrete instance  At the outset there is an important distinction to be made between techniques on the one hand and soil conservation projects programmes or policies on the other 
A technique refers to the mechanical or agronomic method applied and in any one conservation project there may a considerable variety  The choice of technique is a vital one in a conservation project programme or national policy for two related reasons 
First it will determine the technical success of the project in a ceteris paribus sense that is to say that provided there are no social constraints upon the successful application of the technique it will fulfil the objectives of the project or policy typically in terms of reduced erosion increased yields of crops pasture or forest  Second the choice will impinge upon the social economic and political life of the direct land-users involved as well as village leaders and local and national politicians and involve administrators extension agents and other government personnel in particular ways 
The distinction between technique and project or policy is clearly drawn from this evaluation of conservation in Tanganyika  We have already seen that most conservation schemes failed in Tanganyika 
However the reasons for their failure can not be found simply in an examination of the physical factors of the soil and environment  With some notable exceptions such as the use of terracing in the Ulugurus most of the measures involved could have been successful in physically preventing soil erosion 
However the colonial administrators were wrong in their particular approach to the problem and it is here and in the reaction of the Africans to colonial attitudes that we can find reasons for failure  Berry & Townshend 1973 250

Berry & Townshend 1973 250  A conservation policy has a number of components 
First a method of identification of the geographical areas in need of conservation has to be devised e.g. land classification as well as the identification of other associated causes of soil erosion that may lie outside these areas altogether e.g. land tenure legislation  Second it has to be decided who chooses these areas the farmers the district governor the foreign consultant or a committee in the Ministry of Agriculture and likewise who chooses the criteria for the choice itself 
Third the choice of conservation techniques and/or other policy measures is another important component of a conservation policy  Fourth the means of implementation is vital in terms of who does the policing of fenced-off pastures or restrictions on land-use and how extension new inputs and other specialist skills are to be delivered to the farmers or pastoralists themselves 
Fifth the question of who pays who benefits and who loses is an essential one to be addressed by any conservation policy  Lastly other related policy issues at the national level which usually involve wider considerations than soil conservation are an integral part of any conservation programme 
Thus a conservation policy involves a wide ranging set of economic political and social issues  So it is the success of an implemented programme or policy rather than the success of a conservation technique at a trial stage under research station conditions which should be the chief objective of evaluation and critical analysis 
This implies that evaluation of techniques should be a sub-set of more ambitious terms of reference  It is not surprising that for every evaluation of a conservation programme or policy there are perhaps ten of conservation techniques 
There are a number of reasons for this  First there are the considerable methodological problems of economic evaluation of whole policies and programmes in terms of costs and benefits particularly the latter Amos 1982 
Second trials of conservation techniques usually originate under controlled conditions of the research station or large plantation where there are facilities for detailed and undisturbed instrumentation  This further encourages the evaluation of techniques in terms of physical targets rather than of other wider objectives in actual practice i.e. in a sizeable project or programme 
There is a considerable number of evaluations of pilot or small projects involving a small catchment and a handful of farmers such as those undertaken routinely by FAO IBRD or other bilateral aid agencies  These pilot projects represent in principle a transition phase between research station and the real world 
However one suspects that the transition is illusory since the formidable constraints to translating techniques into widely-adopted practice only become fully apparent when the project is big enough potentially to have a significant impact  It then runs into problems of political opposition of local people enforced differentiation between winners and losers in the countryside and may expose the inadequacies of the agricultural extension staff agricultural engineers support staff and the like 
In short replication often becomes impossible  This general tendency in soil conservation evaluation derives from similar problems identified by critics of the existing approaches to agricultural research namely the lack of a continuous outreach to and from research stations and farmers and the conducting of programmes under conditions that do not exist for the farmer/pastoralist who is supposed to adopt them Biggs 1981 
Third in many cases policies are not evaluated because they often tend to be unsuccessful  Admittedly there is a sense in which this assertion is tautologous if they are so seldom evaluated how can one say they are often unsuccessful 
As the next section attempts to show the case is largely made in reverse there is very little written evidence of successful programmes and sizeable projects and most partial evaluations and comments on conservation policies indicate failure  The point here is that techniques get evaluated and researched but programmes and policies do not with the result that the social factors which block policies tend to go unresearched too or at best identified piecemeal although lip-service to their importance is sometimes paid 
It is an almost universal assumption that a conservation policy is a set of conservation techniques and very little else  The state of the art of soil conservation is clearly in a sorry mess The need for soil conservation was emphasised by Bennett 1955 Jacks and Whyte 1939 and many others but so little has been achieved that most recent reports are virtually undistinguishable in factual content and sentiment from the earlier studies 
Morgan in Kirkby & Morgan 1980 303  Certainly a reading of the soil conservation literature through seventy years or so exposes the lack of substantive progress in the identification of the problems and even the technical solutions with the possible exception of the demonstration of the importance of rainsplash in soil erosion 
In the English language literature Malcolm 1938 although apparently much of this work was written as far back as 1910 Glover 1946 Rounce 1949 and Hyams 1952 alongside those mentioned in the quotation above are all striking original works marked by their intimate knowledge of local agricultural practices and the general processes of soil erosion  Recent literature has not dated these classics an indication of a lack of its ability to transcend them 
This section reviews briefly the range of techniques which are available at present  Readers are directed to a number of standard texts on the subject Hudson 1971 FAO 1977a Morgan 1979 Webster & Wilson 1980 
Although this book is not concerned directly with techniques themselves a political-economic analysis of soil erosion and conservation must start with them  The section takes the form of a list and is meant as an introduction for social scientists who are not familiar with conservation techniques 
For those who are in the professional fields closest to conservation techniques this section will not offer them anything new  They are of two different types mechanical protection works and agronomic methods although they are usually used together in any soil conservation project 
Mechanical protection works are permanent structures of earth or masonry which are designed to protect soil from water erosion and to conserve water as a resource by means of interception diversion and deceleration of surface and sub-surface run off  These include gully control structures waterways and storm diversion channels in or above cultivated areas sometimes planted with grasses sometimes floored with stones or concrete storm dams of earthen concrete or stone and wire construction and terraces 
The latter have a very wide variety  Indeed contour ploughing contour brushwood planting and ditch-and-bund constructions could be said to be types of terrace 
The oldest mechanical conservation measure is the bench terrace which consists of a series of steps cut into the slope on the contour of which the forward edge can be lined with stone or planted with bushes trees or grasses  They clearly require very large labour or capital inputs and are only suitable where either very high value crops can be grown and/or in areas of high population density 
They are found around the Mediterranean particularly for vine growing in semi-arid areas such as Yemen and Peru and in many localities of the humid tropics where population densities are high such as the Philippines Java Sumatra China the Himalayan foothills Rwanda Burundi Uganda and the Cameroons Goudie 1981 136 127â€“39 for a general review of the physical processes of soil erosion and human efforts to control it  Other types of terrace also exist such as the ridge terrace where a ridge of earth on the lower side and a channel on the upper side provide the mechanism for increased water retention and infiltration and reduction and deceleration of surface run off 
These frequently need large amounts of earth moved particularly the broader-based ridge terrace and are therefore frequently built by terracers or graders  The disposal of run off from most types of terrace needs careful construction of a system of drains and channels usually designed on the basis of calculations or informed guesses on the probability of the intensity and duration of storms 
Agronomic techniques of conservation are perhaps more in terms of preventing the start of the process of removal of soil particles by the introduction of farming practices which will provide stable yields through time  Most conservation schemes combine both mechanical and agronomic techniques and in many instances they are complementary 
For example gully erosion can be treated by mechanical means e.g. a masonry drop structure with apron cutting back the gully head to stable ground and planting it to grass and/or trees and following a variety of agronomic measures above the gully to reverse practices which brought about sheet and then gully erosion in the first place  Agronomic techniques were developed rather later than mechanical ones following the identification of the importance of rainsplash as a major element in the erosion process 
During the 1950s and by the 1960s packages had been designed in the United States which were then transferred to the very different physical and social conditions of the Third World  Since then international agencies such as ICRISAT and IITA have been undertaking further research on the more fundamental adaptations that now appear to be required Hudson 1981 
The techniques refer to new or modified agricultural practices to reduce soil degradation and erosion  Their recommendation to farmers is usually based upon an ad hoc or more systematic land capability assessment 
This suggests a suitable crop or land use and there may be very different weightings given by different land-users and government agents to what is regarded as suitable  New tillage practices are encouraged which seek to increase vegetative protection of the soil and reduce the effects of wind erosion and direct splashing of rain on the soil 
Rainsplash washes elements downslope and reduces infiltration capacity by dispersing clay particles into the large interstices of the soil  New tillage practices also reduce loss of soil moisture to increase yields build up humus formation and encourage a net increase in the natural production of soil nutrients 
To these ends longer and new crop rotations can be introduced  These usually involve increasing plant diversity contour ploughing inter-cropping minimum or no-tillage systems and grass strips with or without grass-covered storm channels or bunds and with or without brushwood planting along the contours between strips 
The development of forests either by wholesale re planting of watersheds or in smaller areas such as gullies and riverbanks in other small lots such as fuelwood plots on terrace-backs and field boundaries for fuel and/or fodder or in lines for the additional purpose of windbreaks is also an important element in most conservation schemes  Pastures can be reseeded and the quality of livestock increased by breeding programmes increased veterinary services improved supplementary feeds and fodder crops all of which aim to increase yields and reduce the number of stock on degraded and eroded pastures 
Many of these techniques of conservation have already been developed by cultivators and pastoralists themselves  There are many examples cited of local soil conservation tie-ridging of the Kara and the Matengo pit system reported by Ranger 1971 for Zambia contour ridging and inter-cropping in Tanzania Stocking 1982 denshering in western Cameroon Kassapu 1979 and a variety of techniques discussed by Richards 1975 
However many of these locally developed techniques have been discontinued for reasons that are discussed later in Chapter 8  There are also negative measures in the sense of restriction of land-uses and exclusion of people and/or livestock from certain areas 
Although conservation policies of land-use should be positive and encouraging not restrictive Hudson 1971 79 they frequently include these measures which aim to stop certain agricultural or pastoral practices which are identified as harmful  These include shifting cultivation for example in Zambia where it is nationally outlawed or in certain areas such as Sukumuland in Tanzania Berry and Townshend 1973 
Alternatively all cultivation can be banned from specific areas such as river banks as in Kenya watersheds or very steep slopes  Other restrictions apply to the felling or cropping of trees even the collection of forest litter either altogether where forests are no-go areas or on a rotational basis as suggested by Glover 1946 for hilly areas in the Punjab 
Restriction of livestock with similar variations is also a frequent negative element in combinations of conservation techniques  A similar classification of soil and pasture conservation is succinctly provided by FAO 1977b and is reproduced in summary form on Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 
Even a brief and superficial review of national soil and pasture conservation policies indicates that with a few significant exceptions their results fall far short of their intentions  While pilot projects and research station experimental plots often attract encouraging reviews and progress reports programmes and policies almost universally have run into serious difficulties 
The review here can not claim to have gone into any great depth but its purpose is correspondingly modest and that is to provide some support to this generalisation  Maybe techniques of evaluation important though they are need not be sharp when faced with a strong weight of empirical and impressionist evidence of the failure of conservation efforts to halt the deteriorating environmental situation in substantial areas of the world 
In a general sense the evidence examined in Chapter 2 that in many parts of the world soil erosion floods soil degradation and deforestation were probably getting worse could be used in a crude sense to show that conservation policies have not succeeded  However more evidence is needed about soil conservation programmes themselves 
The sort of evidence for success that one may look for is the fulfilment of the general objectives suggested by FAO 1976b that is the increase of food production and standard of living of the people by means of soil and water conservation policies  Thus a rapid review of conservation world-wide can be expected to provide evidence as to whether there exist programmes which have fulfilled these general objectives for substantial numbers of people say at least tens of thousands without insisting on precise standards of measurement 
In this brief scanning of national efforts the reasons for success or failure the political-economic conditions under which they were made and the technical details of conservation practices are only briefly mentioned  It is also assumed in this review that it is only officially sponsored programmes or policies that are being discussed 
There are plenty of success stories where governments have not intervened or where it has not even been acknowledged that farmers and pastoralists have quietly got on with the business of conservation for themselves and frequently provided sustainable surpluses for the market as well  It is instructive to start with the USA which in many senses is the country on which much of the methodological legal technical and institutional aspects of conservation policies of other countries have been modelled 
A number of far-reaching evaluations have recently taken place culminating in the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 abbreviated to RCA  Rasmussen 1982:3 asks the question that might be raised today is why erosion remains a severe problem after forty-five years of cooperative efforts by farmers and the federal government to solve it 
The title of Cater 's article 1977 Soil erosion the problem persists despite the billions spent on it speaks for itself  A more equivocal comment that perhaps best sums up the evaluations that led to RCA has been made by Timmons 1980 While these measures in soil conservation have seldom attained goals increases in soil erosion were minimised and occasionally soil losses reduced 
Despite these efforts erosion losses remain excessive and may have increased during the 1970s and this trend may continue indefinitely into the future  However the sophisticated methodology of land-use planning as well as the policy instruments of the programme have recently been shown to be very fragile and unable to prevent large areas of land previously left uncultivated because of susceptibility to erosion being once more put under the plough 
Cook 1983 traces the impact of the decision to sell grain to the Soviet Union and the government 's renewed intention to use food as a political weapon upon the expansion of 27 million acres of arable land and a large increase in the annual rate of soil loss  In spite of a long-established programme with the best technical expertise in the world the programme over the years has achieved a very mixed success 
Its importance in soil conservation practice is world-wide partly because much of the international literature on the subject in popular and scientific journals is written by Americans and partly because of the American foreign aid programme in which conservation plays an important part  Large numbers of American aid personnel advise many of the governments of lesser developed countries 
However the methodologies in assessing soil erosion hazard as well as policy instruments may well not be applicable outside the United States  Moving now to lesser developed countries a general review of conservation programmes of Algeria Tunisia and Morocco Bensalem in FAO 1977a 159 concludes that soil conservation practices in North Africa have been focussed mainly on corrective mechanical measures which in most cases have been insufficient or not suitably adapted to counter erosion problems He goes on like so many other commentators about the lack of applied knowledge of both the appropriate technical options e.g. the successional capacity of the native plant cover which can be used to rehabilitate degraded land but also very significantly there are soil conservation and dune afforestation schemes dating back thirty years some succeeding and others failing but without explanation of why p. 159 
Another older FAO report 1966 suggests that a total lack of local participation in conservation measures was the major reason for widespread failure  Heusch 1981 423 commenting on conservation in the Rif mountains Morocco comes to the conclusion that 
soil erosion in the Rif is the by-product of the submission of highlanders under more dynamic groups of high living standards  This leads to a neglect of conservation management the soil conservation expert is thus requested to propose technical and educational solutions to socio-political problems whilst the sociologist is given the task of obtaining the approval of the population for measures taken without its advice and real consent

This quotation has many interesting strands some of which are explored later on in this book  Nigeria 's soil erosion problem has been recognised as extremely serious but conservation has only become a national concern during the Third National Plan 1975â€“80 
Olayide and Falusi 1977 1 15 comment that past government efforts in soil conservation have been very meagre and have had little impact in solving the erosion problems  Moving into Central and Southern Africa Zambia 's post-colonial conservation programme is seen by Robinson 1978b to have been adversely affected by the preceding oppressive colonial efforts at conservation 
Politicians are reluctant to popularise or enforce measures against which many campaigned prior to Independence and the majority of farmers remain unaware of the causes of erosion and unconvinced of the need for or value of conservation measures ibid. 28  India 's long-established conservation and forestry programmes are well documented in terms of plans and normative statements about the future but lack evaluations 
Agarawal 1980 109 points to failures of social forestry programmes also documented by Alvares 1982  Agarawal also points out other failures of forestry and fuelwood projects in Java p. 105 and Upper Volta p.166 mainly blaming a lack of a community of local interests 
Bali 1974 talks of the need for reorientation of the whole of conservation policy in India while Ranganathan 1978 attributes failures of past efforts to inter-departmental rivalry and lack of extension  Also Patnaik 1975 Parikh 1977 Gribbin 1982 and Kulkarni 1983 leave little doubt of the glaring failures of Indian conservation 
Perhaps the two most comprehensive critical reviews of the Indian soil conservation are the Centre for Science and Environment 's The State of the Indian Environment 1982 and Cahill 's report for the FAO 1981  The former concentrates on what is actually happening comprehensively outlining the growing problems of deforestation desertification soil erosion flooding siltation as well as a decline in standards in health housing and industrial pollution control 
From both this report and that of Cahill ibid. it is quite clear that the problem is severe and getting worse and that the national soil conservation programme is not dealing with it  looking into the future what is important is not so much the extent but the rate of progress with soil conservation 
At a completion rare of one percent per annum the total task would take 100 years  The actual rate of completion per annum over the last 27 years has been less than one half of one percent thus even at several times the projected rate of progress the great bulk of the conservation task will be incomplete at a time when the most vigorous additional demand is placed on land from massive upsurge of population

Cahill 1981 2  Thailand 's efforts to stem serious erosion problems resulting from the extension of cultivated land as a result of population growth and an expansion of a market for commercial crops and large-scale destruction of forests by logging companies and to a lesser extent local cultivators are reported to be largely ineffective Kilakuldilok 1981 El-Swaify et al. 
1982  Kilakuldilok attributes this to a familiar list of reasons institutional weaknesses in all aspects of conservation lack of political will rapid population growth and lack of a coherent long-term policy 
There have been a small number of fairly successful conservation projects notably Chang Mei and at Ma Sae UNEP 1979 83 but they do not materially detract from the view that Thai conservation policy is not succeeding in reversing national trends of rapid forest clearance and increasing erosion hazards  Malaysia 's efforts are also judged to be inadequate MacAndrews and Sien eds. 1979 30 and by Hamzah bin Abdul Majid also in MacAndrews and Sien eds. 54 
South Korea 's reafforestation and erosion control programme is one of the few that has enjoyed considerable success  Although there had been a long established tradition of community and private forestry schemes it was not until the launching of the Saemol Undong or New Community Movement in 1970 that it was possible to conceive of a nation-wide forestry policy and programme 
A ten year Forestry development Plan was initiated in 1973 and it was organised largely within the institutions and objectives of Saemol Undong which emphasised effectively a broad-based approach to achieving rural welfare an incremental step-by-step planning by villagers for their own village with an emphasis on short-term gains in income and adequate government back-up services  Physical targets were mostly achieved four or five years ahead of schedule FAO 1982a 67 although there were shifts in the emphasis between sub-targets e.g. from fruit and nut trees to long rotation species 
The whole programme consisted of reforestation nursery operations tending operations and erosion control hillside treatment and sand-dune fixation  The political will came at a critical time when it was very necessary to keep the food costs component of the total wage bill including the foreign exchange component as low as possible to allow rapid and profitable industrialisation 
Since most of the surplus food was from the lowlands with irrigation water originating in the highlands widespread deforestation in the latter areas had had very serious effects upon the ability of South Korea to feed itself  In addition large rural-urban income differentials and massive urban migration contributed to a very unstable situation from about 1962â€“70 
Thus in South Korea there were exceptional circumstances in the political economy of the country that led to a highly vigorous programme of rural uplift of which conservation was only one part  For a more general discussion of South Korea 's development see Brandt 1978 and ESCAP 1979 
China 's conservation efforts have received a good deal of attention and it has been difficult to sort out myth from reality  This was partly due to the West 's indifference to information gathering until recently the lack of scientific and cultural exchanges until China became a member of the UN in 1971 and extreme xenophobia on the part of the Chinese government engendered by the Cultural Revolution 
It is undoubtedly one of the major conservation programmes of the world  Very favourable accounts by Sandbach 1980 and Qu Geping 1980 have recently been qualified by Howard 1981 for the highly vulnerable loess soils some reservations and the need for further mobilisation of the masses as expressed by Dequi et al 
for the Winding River Valley 1982 and a number of more damning commentaries on China 's forest policies Eckholm 1976 Smil 1979 Delfs 1982  Undoubtedly there have been numerous policy turnabouts most noticeably at the time of the Cultural Revolution when forestry resources were misused for unsuitable land reclamation Gustafsson undated which in certain particularly vulnerable areas may have exacerbated the destructive floods of autumn 1981 
But the combination of the daunting task of national reconstruction after the Communist victory in 1949 the neglect of conservation for centuries and a variety of purely physical factors making for great erosion hazards must also be taken into account  Thus as in the case of the USA the size and complexity of the programmes mixed successes and the possibility that programmes have significantly reduced soil losses or even the rate of decline rather than improved yields point to the need for a longer and more sophisticated assessment than is given here 
In Latin America the state of soil erosion programmes is even worse Preston 1980  Freeman 1980 estimates that 80 per cent of Bolivia 's farmlands and grazing areas are eroded in varying degrees and rangelands are degraded down to 10 per cent of their original productivity 
He estimates that between 35- 41 per cent of all useful land is affected by erosion  In response to this situation the national government has made no response to the problem of erosion and none is planned 
Paraguay does not even have a department or other state institution which is supposed to initiate soil conservation and range management  In the case of Brazil evidence presented elsewhere in this book points to widespread erosion particularly in the Selva and in the Serrao of north-central and north-eastern Brazil 
In one consultant 's report it is stated Brazil has no institutions that are capable of undertaking the task of achieving soil conservation and preventing land degradation  At the Federal level there is an Office of the Co-ordination of Soil and Water Conservation but it has a tiny staff and its position within the Ministry of Agriculture does not enable it to have much influence on land-use decisions 
At State level there is simply no administration at all to carry out conservation although at present State Soil Conservation Commissions are in the process of being formed  It comes as no surprise that Brazil 's rural credit policy actually encourages farmers to follow bad farming practices and there is no countervailing influence to change it 
The activities of both large transnational and national companies as well as small-farmer settlers on the northern frontiers of settlement have often been disastrous to the long-term productivity of the land but have gone on unchecked Barbira-Scazzocchio 1980  This very brief review of about ten conservation programmes can not make the case that all national policies fail 
The authors and quotations mentioned however are representative of a wider literature of evaluation but it is the absence of favourable comments which supports the view that this small sample is representative of most other lesser developed countries  In this chapter we will examine various explanations of why most soil conservation policies do not work 
An analysis of the mode of explanation itself is helpful since it makes explicit many unstated assumptions on which these explanations rest  The conclusion will be that these explanations have recently developed in promising directions 
However most still fail to state explicitly their political value judgements and are unaware of their ideology  One of these promising directions has been the realisation that conservation is as much about social processes as physical ones and that the major constraints are not technical in the agricultural engineering sense but social 
Here are four illustrative quotations from the recent literature  Land-use patterns are an expression of deep political economic and cultural structures they do not change overnight when a ecologist or forester sounds the alarm that a country is losing its resource base 
Eckholm 1978 167  The theme of this paper is that knowledge of soil conservation techniques should be improved but the most pressing need is to put into practice what is already known 
Past experience of implementing soil conservation programmes has been disappointing and the paper tries to identify the more important reasons  Hudson 1981 15 
While socioeconomic criteria may often exist in the minds of planners there is an alarming failure to relate social and economic needs to acceptable forms of conservation  In the final analysis if the small farmer and peasant of the Third World can not or will not take conservation to heart no amount of model-building empirical plot studies erosion risk assessment or legislation will result in the preservation of the soil 's resources 
Stocking 1981 377  What should be said is that there is still a most definite need for research in some neglected technical areas but more particularly in integrating the social and economic factors as they occur in a local situation 
Without this integration the results of existing technical research can not be applied in less than the present high risk of failure  MAB 1979 9

MAB 1979 9  However these social factors are not subjected to the same systematic analysis as the technical ones and they remain unconnected irksome and somehow immovable under prevailing analytical frameworks 
The analysis which follows in the succeeding five chapters attempts to show that they are irksome and indeed many are immovable without other deep-seated changes in society and that these can not be advocated or struggled for on the grounds of soil conservation alone  Our starting point lies in the identification of the social factors which help to shape the perception of the problem of soil erosion by those who attempt to intervene in land-use decisions through government action 
Most of the attempts to include social factors in the study of erosion and conservation as the four illustrative quotations show imply that the social problems start with them the land-users themselves  Here we argue that a comprehensive analysis should broaden the scope of the analysis to include conservationists and governments 
Many readers and this author too might therefore find themselves as objects of analysis  The analysis of soil erosion includes those with political power and asks embarrassing questions about their own view of the problem and from where it derived 
It points out that peasants and pastoralists may seem tiresome and contrary but this is an interpretation of political-economic relations which envelops the perceiver too  When official conservation often does not work part of the problem may lie in the assumptions which the conservationist government servant or politician may make about the cause of failure 
These causes range from backwardness of peasants lawlessness and lack of discipline by land-users and inefficient implementation procedures to lack of political will  Behind each cause lie assumptions about the way in which society does and should operate 
Appealing to rather different sentiments there are strong grounds for arguing that scientists should take social responsibility for the technology they develop  Some scientists would still maintain that science is neutral and it is the politicians who select and implement their inventions in particular ways and who should therefore shoulder the blame for undesirable consequences 
In a less dramatic and analogous fashion soil conservationists of all kinds should be able to take a social view of conservation techniques  Bunting 1978 in more general terms disclaims this responsibility and states that with the introduction of high-yielding paddy it was to be expected there were social problems but it was up to the politicians to do something about it 
The view that somehow science here agricultural technology is neutral and it is the fault of irrational politicians or pressure groups is a widely-held one even if a little sheepishly  Oasa and Jennings 1982 go further and show the disdain and hostility that the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat CIMMYT and the International Rice Research Institute IRRI showed for the comments and criticisms of social scientists about the social implications of the technology that these institutions were developing 
These criticisms were ignored although delivered by persons of world-wide reputation such as Carl Sauer received a hostile and defensive reaction or were absorbed by transforming them into a technical issue rather than facing them as a social and political one  This last point is one which is developed here in relation to soil conservation 
The charge of political bias laid at the door of critics and the claim that their own scientific activities were neutral leaves only one way out to make out that the problem lies in technical factors of production that constrain maximum yield performance in maize and not in the interrelationship between social conditions of inequality and the new technologies which CIMMYT and IRRI were developing  The next section discusses a model of soil conservation which derived from the perceptions and objective political economic conditions of the colonial period stretching from about 1880 1960 
Since that period has passed and we can benefit from hindsight and a somewhat altered world view the social factors which moulded this model can be more readily recognised  During the past twenty years or so many soil conservation programmes in lesser developed countries have been initiated financed and often partly staffed by foreign aid institutions particularly multilateral agencies such as the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the World Bank and also the biggest bilateral agency USAID 
These institutions are very different from the colonial ones of the past but none the less many of the assumptions that lie behind today 's conservation policies and projects remain intact  Furthermore much of the writing and even foreign staff in conservation institutions are derived directly from colonial administrations 
Foreign aid is so important in conservation policy-making in lesser developed countries because with a few exceptions most newly independent lesser developed countries had either no official conservation organisation whatsoever as in Latin America with the exception of a couple of Southern Brazilian states or had experienced the colonial model mentioned above principally in Africa South and South-east Asia  For both reasons there was either virtually no official concern about soil erosion or a reaction against enforced policies which were firmly linked to the colonial regime 
Under those circumstances foreign aid agencies saw a vacuum which they felt themselves able to fill  Because of the deeply embedded social issues in soil erosion and conservation and the particular political-economic relations between donor agents and lesser developed countries new problems tended to arise and these are discussed in section 3 
It would be an unjust and simplistic generalisation to claim that most conservation policies and official reactions to soil erosion followed a single set of assumptions  However it 
is possible to identify a syndrome of implicit assumptions in many lesser developed countries ' conservation policies and in more academic and general commentaries on the subject and to follow them through to particular elements in explicit policy  Few actual conservation policies contain all these elements and it is difficult to attribute them in every case to implicit value judgements 
A classic approach implies a static long-established well-recognised and highly valued approach on which particular policies in the future may be based  Both the theory and practice of soil conservation are in a process of change albeit rather slowly and in the opinion of the author often in directions that are not very promising 
In spite of this caveat the implicit assumptions on which policies are based have only slowly evolved from a colonial Euro-centric and messianic intellectual frame of reference which has endured the waning of empire and the regaining of political independence of most former colonies  This is described below 
The classic approach identifies four major problems in rectifying soil erosion  The problem is identified as primarily an environmental problem with environmental solutions 
The opening chapter of this book has put an alternative view and in spite of an awareness of the importance of social factors in environmental degradation there is very little evidence of effectively implemented policies  If soil erosion is principally identified as an environmental problem then the degrees of freedom and policy options which derive from concomitant changes in the social sphere are thereby closed 
Therefore there is a logical tendency to preclude from view the social reasons why people are using the land in such a way as to cause excessive soil erosion and so most conservation policies do not address them at all  Problems of a lack of alternative sources of fuelwood for poor people unequal landholdings political constraints placed upon the pastures of nomads poor prices imposed by the state for the produce of rural areas and so forth tend to lie outside the terms of reference of most conservation policies 
When purely environmentally-dictated policies such as forest closure or forcible destocking of pastures do not work because the social context has been analysed insufficiently force is often contemplated or in administrative language better and tougher implementation and environmental protection  This frequently ends up with the state attempting to protect the environment from the majority of the people who use it 
For example the Agricultural Department of what was then British Kenya when faced with the Wakamba who had marched on Government House as a protest against compulsory destocking in 1938 said  unless some pressure is applied to urge improved methods and practices and unless such pressure is continuously applied it will not be possible to save the fertile areas of Kenya from deterioration without the application of compulsion under legislation to enforce improved agricultural practices 
Clayton E. 1964 citing the Agricultural Department of Kenya  unless some pressure is applied to urge improved methods and practices and unless such pressure is continuously applied it will not be possible to save the fertile areas of Kenya from deterioration without the application of compulsion under legislation to enforce improved agricultural practices 
Clayton E. 1964 citing the Agricultural Department of Kenya  A more up-to-date but similar sentiment advocating a tough approach 
Admonition alone does not appear to be enough  A strict legal regime of soil conservation must be established 
MacAndrews and Chia Lin Sien 1979:30  Admonition alone does not appear to be enough 
A strict legal regime of soil conservation must be established  MacAndrews and Chia Lin Sien 1979:30 
Policy solutions of this kind tended to favour erosion works often paid for by labour inputs on the part of farmers themselves terracing reafforestation and pasture closure implemented by compulsory destocking or exclusion from certain vulnerable areas  They were frequently imposed by colonial regimes using force where necessary 
In colonial Ruanda-Burundi several weeks of free labour had to be given each year by the commune to build up terraces bunds and other erosion works  The paysannat system in the then Belgian Congo had similar compulsive elements Dumont 1970 36 
The problem is blamed on the land users themselves who are seen to have mismanaged the environment because of lack of environmental awareness ignorance apathy and just plain laziness  The more pejorative epithets have disappeared in the post-colonial literature except for one or two extreme examples like Kon Muang Nan 1978 who holds the view that the shifting cultivation practised by tribal people in northern Thailand is the most dangerous national problem and one which undermines national security 
The practice should be eliminated or the people expelled from Thailand altogether he claims  Here are two more highly pejorative explanations of soil erosion 
The natives are simply running wild and ploughing up large areas of land every second year  Not only are they ruining good soil through bad farming but destroying all the valuable timber 
This is a country that can support a lot more natives if properly settled  The main offenders here are non-indigenous natives who have cleared areas ad acres of the best soil farming it very poorly and working it as though it were a private farm there is no rotation of crops and no manure applied which means he will soon be looking for another 100 acres of good soil to ruin 
Inspection Report to Chief Native Commissioner Southern Rhodesia 1938 in Stocking 1978b  The natives are simply running wild and ploughing up large areas of land every second year

One might ask why the non-indigenous whites who ran private farms and thereby improperly unsettled other natives are assumed to use rather than destroy all the valuable timber  Farmers are well known for their conservatism 
The African agriculturalist is no exception and is very tenacious of the customs and methods practised by his forefathers the poor farming methods and soil depleting practices prevalent among peasant cultivators stem from ignorance custom and lethargy the main obstacle to overcome is the native 's lack of understanding of the need for the prevention of soil erosion  Clayton 1964

Clayton 1964  Here are three more restrained post-colonial examples but none the less with the same implication 
Inadequate knowledge of basic factors resulting in excessive or untimely tillage improper implements poor use of the right equipment burning of crop residues and excessive livestock grazing have all contributed to erosion on cultivated land  FAO 1960 1 leading to such a condition which should not happen if all people who use and work the land could have the advantage of scientific knowledge relating to soil and water conservation 
As quickly as possible all countries should adopt an enlightened land-use policy and provide means of carrying it out  FAO 1965 13 
It is basically a problem of the misuse of land particularly in pastoral areas much of the problem results from the customs value systems and attitudes of the people concerning grazing lands and livestock together with the lack of government mechanisms for effective control  FAO 1980 56

The most recent and important example comes from the proposed Forest Bill of India which is at the time of writing about to come before Parliament  It illustrates many points in this chapter but above all the point about blaming forest users 
The bill identifies much of the blame for the tremendously high rate of deforestation in India as belonging to the adivasis or tribal peoples who have been systematically marginalised and impoverished for over a thousand years and who have now retreated into the mountains and remaining forests of central India a close-up case study is provided of a tribal group the Sora in sect. 7.4  The Bill suggests prevention of the adivasis using the forest very heavy fines double if infringements are perpetrated at night and powers of arrest without warrant by forest officers 
Ample evidence exists of the real destroyers of the forests being private contractors who supply the timber demands of industry Centre for Science and Environment 1982 Gribbin 1982  The policy implications of this view of the problem are spread across a continuum from agricultural extension to educate farmers into new and more modern farming practices at the one end to compulsory erosion works and outlawing practices at the other 
Again the root of the problem was perceived to be the cultivators or pastoralists themselves and that blame originated from land use by them under their own free will  If they can be made to change by education or compulsion then the problem of soil erosion and pasture degradation would be solved 
Another problem identified in the classic approach is that of overpopulation  Any Solution to the problem of environmental deterioration must first cope with the basic cause overpopulation 
FAO 1980 57  Any Solution to the problem of environmental deterioration must first cope with the basic cause overpopulation 
FAO 1980 57  The whole issue of the politics of population growth rates in relation to natural resources and production technology is a highly complex one and not discussed in any great detail here 
However it is enough to point out that there are similarities between the overpopulation view and the view that farmers and pastoralists should be educated out of their ignorant lethargic and traditional ways  Both identify the cause of the problem as beginning and ending with the land-users themselves they should change their habits of production and reproduction and the problem of soil erosion would be largely solved 
In some policies the two problems are seen to be combined where the systems of farming collectively called shifting cultivation have reached a point where their carrying capacity has been exceeded and fallow periods have become so short that degradation and erosion have set in Allan 1967  The policy implication here is that family planning programmes are linked strongly with conservation programmes as in Kenya or in India in Sanjay Gandhi 's Four and later Five Point Programme which included both family planning and reafforestation 
The last problem identified in the classic or colonial model is that cultivators and pastoralists who cause soil erosion are insufficiently involved in the market economy  Involvement in the production of surpluses for sale in the market implies modern methods of cultivation and improved productivity so alleviating the population problem and the awareness of financial inducements and incentive to undertake soil conserving agronomic practices and/or erosion works 
The policy implication of this view is a programme to help those farmers who can help themselves to grow cash crops  A quotation provided by Randall Baker private communication from a recent Australian funded cattle ranching scheme in Fiji illustrates both the unquestioned assumption that development must imply modern commercial development and the disparaging attitude towards existing social and economic organisation 
The Fijian traditional communal system of livelihood has a tendency to restrict initiative for commercial expansion and development so that there is a need to modify commercial values to meet with the demands of modern commercialism This in a nutshell is what the Yalavou project sets out 10 do  Fiji Government 1982 71

A case study of Kenya Baker 1981 admirably illustrates many of these points and Fig. 4. 1 from Baker is reproduced summarising many of the points made above  The political and economic origins of this approach to soil conservation go a long way to explaining it 
It was an approach not of the land-users themselves but of their rulers and therefore it is necessary to discuss briefly what the colonial rulers ' political and economic interests were and in what way they related to the people of colonised areas and to the natural resources they found there  Considerably more detail is given in Chapter 7 and only an outline of the major points as they contribute to understanding of this approach to soil erosion appears here 
It is interesting to note that soil conservation as a national policy supported by the various apparatus of state agricultural extension the law and law enforcement agencies was largely an African colonial phenomenon French Belgian and British with a smaller constituent from colonial India and the Dutch East Indies  Therefore the fact that most of the illustrative material comes from Africa and not from Latin America is not by chance 
First of all although colonial policies varied considerably through space and time one of the chief resources for colonial regimes was land  Either local cultivators and pastoralists were cleared from the land completely and it was reserved for European immigrants or in some cases like Uganda and larger parts of Tanganyika local cultivators were encouraged or forced to grow crops for sale either as export crops or as food crops to feed the mining workforces in southern Africa for longer accounts of the processes of settler immigration and colonial policies see Rodney 1972 Palmer & Parsons 1977 
One of the major implications was extreme overcrowding of the local population in terms of their usually extensive farming systems  Usually too the European took the best land as in Algeria for example where 20,000 European farms were established on a third of the cultivable land about 2.5m. ha. while some 630,000 Algerian peasants were confined to 5m. ha 
of dry hilly and thinly soiled areas Stewart 1975  Similar displacements occurred and Africans were confined to reserves in Kenya or to tribal trust lands in Zimbabwe Southern Rhodesia and at the present time in the Bantustans by the Republic of South Africa 
A similar displacement occurred much earlier in the New World where the enconomienda system was established in Latin America and a plantation economy in the Caribbean islands both of which suddenly displaced local cultivators  The existing cultivation systems often caused serious erosion as a result of the instant overpopulation which ensued 
Similar fates befell pastoralists where large areas of seasonal pasture were denied them as in Kenya in both the Masai territory and Karamajong  By assuming the political economic circumstances of this displacement as given of course it seemed natural to the colonial administration that the condition of environmental deterioration was the fault of the cultivators themselves 
Second it was in the economic interests of the colonial and home administrations to persuade or force the cultivator to grow produce for the market either because it increased the cultivator 's taxability and therefore he/she could contribute to the infrastructural administrative and policing costs of the colony or where settlers would or could not do the job it would provide a source of cheap food for the mining workers particularly in southern Africa  Hence the motive for commercialisation of the peasant created a convergence between a philanthropic desire to improve the lot of the peasant and to serve the economic interests of mining companies and colonial administrators 
Many other contemporary examples of both national as well as international institutional policy in which the market is seen as the only means to improve peasants ' and pastoralists ' incomes and to increase their contribution to the national exchequer can be found in Heyer Roberts and Williams 1981  The introduction of new cash crops such as groundnuts particularly in the Savannah areas of Africa south of the Sahara coffee cotton and maize both by European settlers and to local cultivators throughout eastern and southern Africa was strongly supported by all colonial administrations 
Research stations undertook research for the larger white commercial farmers and most African cultivators were actively discouraged from producing in competition with settler farmers Brett 1973  However the introduction of these crops often had serious consequences for soil conservation such as the cultivation of groundnuts in Mali and Niger Franke and Chasin 1980 and pure stand maize cultivation and cotton 
The repercussions of the introduction of cash crops have been analysed in detail in postcolonial times Dinham & Hines 1983 particularly upon a reduced capacity of households to grow enough food for themselves upon nutrition and upon their ability to withstand drought and other socially-induced disasters Copans 1975 O'Keefe et al.  1977 
Of course a set of policies on soil conservation was not simply determined by a few major economic and political interests of colonial powers alone  For one thing they varied enormously from place to place e.g. the distinctions between the policies of the colonial administrations of Kenya and neighbouring Uganda Brett 1973 Leys 1975 and between Anglophone and Francophone Africa 
They varied through time and there were also important contradictions between local governors who understood well these deleterious effects upon cultivators and pastoralists and their paymasters both in the colony and metropole Brett ibid  Chapters 6 and 7 
Last but not least there was an attitude of mind of the rulers towards the ruled varying between paternalism through uncomprehending distaste to outright racism  Africans received laws fines and even imprisonment for certain agricultural and pastoral practices and the other restrictions which enabled Europeans to realise their economic interests of the day while European settlers received physical infrastructure loans and an agricultural extension service backed by research stations which researched commercial crops for commercial farmers 
What evidence is there that these overt policies and covert assumptions have outlived the political and economic structures which brought them into being  After all most countries which were colonies in the past have regained their independence 
There are two lines of argument here  The first is that the conservation policies themselves still have many of the assumptions of the colonial model 
Some post-colonial examples have already been given and more appear in Chapter 7  The second argument is that many structures of appropriation of surpluses from peasantries and pastoralists which were established during the late colonial period still exist 
While political independence is a contemporary and important fact of life in all but a handful of countries the economic incorporation of their economies into the world economy continues and deepens  The aspects of this process which affect land-users are discussed in detail in Chapter 7 
Briefly the incorporation of an economy into the world economic system involves an extension of the market mechanism between producers and consumers in the lesser developed country with other countries or transnational companies and thereby a closer political relationship between other trading partners and national or international financial institutions  Incorporation is both affected by the effects of the internal class structure of the lesser developed country and as it deepens becomes a determining process of social development or retrogression 
Although the approach of this book makes its political stance clear it is not its intention to undertake a wide-ranging critique of various models of social change  It is not necessary for readers to agree completely with the ideology of the approach to arrive at some of the same conclusions about soil erosion as found here 
For example if readers agree that incorporation is the only feasible and desirable route to social development e.g. Bauer 1976 66f. then soil erosion has to be counted as an inevitable cost  However the reader could still maintain an internally consistent position by advocating incorporation as the only feasible route to modernisation and development at the same time as acknowledging the linkages between these processes and soil erosion 
To expose the contradictions of the world economic system by identifying soil erosion in lesser developed countries is like expecting the tail to wag the dog  Soil erosion is one of its many contradictions and for reasons amply discussed in this book it is one of the most diffuse and complex areas of analysis 
It is not one to rally the world 's peasantries pastoralists and other land-users to change the social conditions which bring about soil erosion in the first place  We return to this point in Chapter 9.2 
Many conservation programmes in lesser developed countries have been initiated financed and partly staffed by foreign aid donors both multilateral and bilateral of which by far the most important financially and intellectually has been USAID  Given the fact that soil conservation as a government policy was a colonial phenomenon it is perhaps not surprising that in post-colonial Africa at least foreign aid tended to move into the vacuum left by the colonial administration 
Also the USA exported its long experience with trying to deal with its own soil erosion problems as a part of foreign policy to its sphere of influence in Latin America in the 1950s where there had been an almost complete lack of government concern over soil erosion  Foreign aid has received a number of critical analyses the best known of which is by LappÃ© et al. 
1980 and in relation to the activities of the World Bank Payer 1982 and these will not be reviewed here  In a sentence the kernel of the criticism is that foreign aid tends to serve narrow donor interests and those of the classes in recipient countries that will most benefit that it incorporates the lesser developed country into dependent relations with industrialised nations and that through a series of bureaucratic filters special interests and general bungling frequently does harm not good 
Soil conservation programmes by the nature of their objectives and the distribution of personal rewards which are usually meagre since there is little money to be made out of them are immune from many of the more trenchant criticisms of foreign aid policies and programmes  However the fact that soil conservation and other related programmes are delivered through foreign aid institutions poses additional problems for their success 
The elements which are essential in most conservation policies are often contradicted by the limitations and objectives of foreign aid  Table 4.1 below summarises some of these contradictions 
The results of these contradictions tend to follow a pattern  First of all there is the project document of which the format and content are so often quite unsuited to tackling the formidable tasks required for a successful conservation programme 
Typically there is a short anodyne introduction to the economy of the recipient nation emphasising the need for conservation and the nation 's laudable attempts to meet it  There is seldom any serious political analysis either of the ruling class(es) and how they express their interests through the state and its institutions or of civil society where the conservation is supposed to happen 
There are obvious reasons why not but its absence contributes to a continuation of failed projects because authors make heroic assumptions and quantify them to produce fanciful targets  Political-economic analysis could help professional economists both by providing a critique of their ideology and also in assessing what is feasible who will benefit and lose from their policies what will tend to be done or left undone in the project and so on 
The project document continues with a good deal of detail about the erosion works areas to be covered by different treatments and the expected benefits  An economic appraisal is provided usually on a before-and-after or with-and-without the project basis 
Here most of all in the project appraisal does quantification mystify and legitimate in the name of objective economic analysis  Busy bureaucrats accountants division chiefs and so on can always check the budget to the last dollar suggest improvements to the organigram of the project add a foreign-training component and so on 
On the other hand it is a lengthy task based on shrewd local knowledge and acute economic and political-economic judgement to appraise the appraisal  So the organisation of personnel budget physical specifications of buildings office equipment etc. take up the rest of the project document and its appendices 
There is little time and little scope for an in-depth analysis of the political-economic context of the conservation programme  Lest this account seem unduly cynical it must be added that the individuals involved are subordinate to the functional constraints of their job 
They are not paid to raise unnecessary dust in the formulation of a project they are paid to design a project to spend earmarked funds in a way that they see as best  Even those who are acutely aware of these constraints have to be content with doing their job to the best of their ability although they may be aware of the probable shortfall in impact of the whole project 
The project is then signed by representatives of the donor and recipient country and implementation starts  A search through a considerable number of mid-term and final reviews and evaluations of conservation projects by the author produced an interesting pattern 
However it is a very difficult and time-consuming operation to read through the evaluations and to compare them to the original project document  Here are some of the findings from a search through project documents and reviews 
a  Physical achievements with an exact specific output are usually reached such as buildings most erosion control works training programmes aerial photography mapping sub-projects and so on 
b  The build-up of trained personnel and institutional development also usually goes according to schedule 
c  The development of agronomic research into soil conserving practices also in four cases where the search discovered projects with this component seems to have occurred at the research station and on the land of a handful of farmers 
Outreach to land-users in the project area was in all cases slower than expected or seemed to have been forgotten altogether in the evaluation  d 
Where conservation was part of a wider package of rural development programmes e.g. in integrated rural development projects the physical outputs were achieved on target such as construction of storage facilities target areas planted under some improved varieties of crops the planting of trees in big plantations the establishment of sawmills agro-processing plants mills and packing stations  However other more ambitious targets such as reducing the rate of soil erosion improving the offtake of pastures and the diffusion of soil conserving land management practices almost always were not achieved 
Benefits were distributed socially and spatially less widely than anticipated  Physical achievements with an exact specific output are usually reached such as buildings most erosion control works training programmes aerial photography mapping sub-projects and so on

However other more ambitious targets such as reducing the rate of soil erosion improving the offtake of pastures and the diffusion of soil conserving land management practices almost always were not achieved  Benefits were distributed socially and spatially less widely than anticipated 
This summary of findings does not refer to all foreign aid projects  It is the combination of the particular elements required by successful conservation projects with the particular political economic and logistic constraints under which foreign aid has to operate that limit the fulfilment of objectives 
The problems discussed in this section are not necessarily separate from those outlined as deriving from the colonial model indeed they frequently overlap  When they do the results are all the more dismal 
Chapter 3 has suggested that many soil conservation policies fail and section 2 of this chapter has identified an historical model of the conceptualisation of the soil erosion problem and its policy solutions  Although many elements of that model still exist today there is also quite widespread dissatisfaction with it and there has been some attempt to find out why and to modify these elements 
Although this effort has been piecemeal and has occurred in widely differing contexts the direction in which it is moving can be identified  Still many of the most fundamental social factors behind the conceptualisation of the causes of soil erosion and the role of government have still not been analysed coherently and remain at best labelled and hidden in a number of black boxes 
Here are some of the reasons that are commonly found in contemporary documentation for failures in conservation programmes  a 
Conservation techniques do not conserve soil in practice because of technical failures through inadequate or misapplied research  These range from the collapse of concrete-walled and widened terraces constructed by the Israelis in occupied territories Bunyard 1980 to repeated failure of inflexible concrete check dams nowadays frequently replaced by gabion breached bunds inadequate storm channels and inadequate knowledge of the requirements and performance of grasses and trees 
Other examples include Nobe and Seckler for Lesotho 1979 Robinson for Zambia 1978a 1978b Coulson 1981 Rapp 1975 and Rapp et al.  1973 
b  Conservation techniques do not fit into agricultural and pastoral practices and therefore are not applied by farmers or pastoralists 
An extended example of local conservation techniques being neglected or even discouraged and government initiated ones being encouraged and later on forced upon the local population is given by Berry and Townshend 1973  Table 4.2 adapted and added to the original ibid 246 indicates the techniques their origin and their acceptance 
One or two extra and up-dated pieces of information are supplied Eco-Systems 1982  Inspection of Table 4.2 shows that those techniques already practised by local farmers which the colonial government also encouraged and wished to extend were accepted 
Those introduced by government which were similar to those already employed e.g. contour ridging were also accepted  Others ran into practical difficulties 
For example contour banks in the Mbeya region led to rat infestation wide grass strips and contour hedges often used up too much land  Boxed and broad-based terraces required an enormous amount of labour reduced yields and proved unstable 
Coercion had to be used to get local farmers to undertake these technically dubious measures  Many conservation schemes in southern and central Africa demanded a reduction in stocking rates and thus in the major form of storage of wealth capital and prestige Stocking 1981a for Swaziland Cliffe 1964 in Tanzania 
In Java Pickering 1979 reports in detail problems of the same kind  Ridge and tree planting on very steep slopes met resistance when the trees grew enough to shade food crops planted in between and were savagely pruned back 
Constant supervision of seedling trees was also a problem  However this technique was better accepted on poorer lands where food crops were less attractive relative to fuelwood 
Bench terraces were technically effective but ran into problems with the marginal farmer who was unable to sustain the temporary loss of food crops which terracing usually entails  Lastly a scheme for silvipasture involving quite an intricate technology combining livestock-rearing fodder grasses and fuelwood needed considerable capital and physical back-up on the part of farmers the larger operators of whom were successful 
Bonsu 1981 reports the results of experiments to reduce erosion in a savannah soil of northern Ghana by means of a number of agronomic practices including the leaving of crop residues as a mulch  One wonders how successful this was bearing in mind that residues are used there to feed livestock as fuel to cook food and to construct roofs for houses 
Indeed one could posit the hypothesis that this technique if enforced would put more pressure on sparse thorn/acacia resources or possibly animal dung as cooking fuel rather than as a fertiliser  The commonly promoted answer to these problems is more research into the decisions and practices of users UN Desertification Conference Nairobi 1977 
This is perhaps one of the few areas in which more research may provide genuinely useful insights for more realistic conservation programmes  c 
Conservation is hampered by existing land tenure conditions  In many countries with very unequal land holdings land reform is considered an essential prerequisite to a successful soil conservation programme e.g. Baker 1980 for Peru and Eckholm 1976 55 in order to encourage secure and long leases of land so that tenants would invest in conservation and in some cases provide marginal farmers with more land and therefore income to be able to afford conservation measures FAO 1977a 27 
Eckholm 1976 55 recounts the case in Ethiopia before the land reform of 1975 when peasants forced to work on a reafforestation project planted the seedlings upside-down as a protest against oppressive land tenure conditions  This example shows the indirect effects of tenure upon the attitude of subordinated peasants who had to plant trees on someone else 's land 
The same author goes on to say that there are cases where land reform or at least the break-up of large latifundia or estates had actually accelerated environmental decline as in Bolivia in the 1950s or after the emancipation of serfs in Russia in 1816  The major constraints which tenure conditions impose upon conservation programmes that discourage private initiatives to invest in conservation practices are short leases which tempt the tenant to remove as much plant material and nutrients as possible from the soil within the period of tenancy insecurity of tenants in longer leases uncertainty of compensation to tenants by landlords for conservation works at the end of the lease and a lack of an accepted means by which landlord and tenant can share these outlays in the first place Barlowe 1958 
d  A lack of participation by land-users in government sponsored conservation 
This explanation clearly overlaps the previous one where conservation cuts across existing agricultural and pastoral practices  Presumably preliminary consultation by conservation agencies and institutional involvement of local people in plan formulation and implementation would avoid these clashes 
However it goes further than that and implies a lack of awareness of the need for conservation of future private benefits for individual households and the village or larger local community as a whole leading to a failure to mobilise people to give their labour for construction even when it will be paid for for maintenance work and for enforcement where discipline is required to control lopping of small seedlings to exclude livestock from reafforested and other areas and so on  Bringing about community participation in forestry programmes would usually require a more equal pattern of land ownership and control than exists in most LDC 's that is require redistributive land reform 
Cooperation is rarely found to succeed amongst those who are unequal in material terms since it becomes difficult both to ensure an equal distribution of costs and benefits  Agarawal 1980 161 
This is an important but different explanation from that which attributes failure of conservation programmes to the conservation agency e.g. the Ministry of Forestry the Environment or ad hoc project staff being ineffective in getting local people to cooperate with them  Indeed internal dissensions between different groups of local people may lead to indifference on their part to government personnel and their efforts but the causes and remedies of the two explanations are different 
In Nepal a number of inequalities in the distribution of costs and benefits of various conservation programmes and related projects for increasing agricultural and fuelwood production can be identified Blaikie 1981 1983  Households with less privately-owned land which had to rely on the public economy the forest for livestock rearing rather than private land were less willing to see restrictions placed upon access to forests or to others ' private land for stubble grazing in cases where fodder tree planting on terrace backs was being advocated 
According to one source it was an immensely slow and difficult process for the British and Nepalese project personnel to get the village panchayat village council to agree to communal efforts necessary for conservation seed replication programmes seedling nurseries terrace improvements terrace-back planting woodfuel lot planting and stock improvement because of the vissiparious effects of perceived and real different costs and benefits of various parts of the scheme  This was used as one of the major defences of the British aid programme in Nepal which was to concentrate their efforts in villages with a predominant presence of ex-Gurkha soldiers which would encourage both better rapport between British field officers and farmers as well as an ex- army-style sense of organisation discipline and work-practice within the village itself 
In these villages it was argued a lack of common purpose would be less pronounced  Taking a counter-example the success of a project reported by Veblen 1978 for an area in western Guatemala was attributed to the institution of communal forest holdings or ejido which has favoured preservation of the forests of Totonicapan 
Communal overexploitation was averted first because of inter-personal face-to-face relationships involved in the design and implementation of forest preservation by a small community where enforcement and the meting out of punishments was a matter for the forest users themselves second because of the existence of a special interest group carpenters and third the shared and fierce desire of the people to remain as independent of outside influence and control as possible p. 434  Another isolated success story is reported by Shaxson 1981 reported in Morgan 1981 in India where a village finally decided to restore its hill-grazing area and plant fuelwood trees the scheme being designed and implemented locally 
It is instructive to compare these accounts with another proposed project FAO/UNDP reported by Velloso 1981 in Honduras where an effective linkage between the community and Honduran entrepreneurs for the proper exploitation and industrialisation of forests was hoped for  The Comayagua Plan includes a hydroelectric plant to fuel a planned woodpulp and paper factory an experimental nursery to test possible future forest products and the creation of employment opportunities to compensate local people for the necessary reduction in their livestock rearing 
The achievement of local participation seems very remote and a lion 's share of the benefits will probably accrue to more powerful elements entrepreneurs and outsiders  Other more coercive measures are almost bound to be used when participation breaks down a general issue which will be returned to later 
Turning to the relationship between direct land-users and conservation agents lack of participation of the former has been attributed to governments not involving the people in the design and implementation of the project  Where government introduces measures that exclude people from resources long since used by them the people come to view the project as a zero-sum game Thomson in Glantz ed. 1977 where their loss is exactly others ' gain and conservation will not in the long run lead to an increase in their incomes 
A lack of government efforts to involve local people is often contributory to the design of projects which cut across existing agricultural practices and tenurial arrangements  But also in another sense conservation has frequently been seen as an imposition so much so that many local people rioted formed armed resistance and used the issue as a nucleus for organising wide-ranging political dissent in eastern Africa against the British colonial administration Young and Fosbrooke 1960 Cliffe 1964 
In the colonial context the word participation had an uncomfortable ring about it quite alien to the ideology of the political status quo and the colonial administration and agricultural extension service knowing what was good for the African cultivator  Another example in Algeria shortly after independence is discussed by Stewart 1975 31 
The central criticism of the 1960 programme has always been directed against its allegedly authoritarian character  The treatment was to be decided by experts and the people had simply to accept it 
Their acquiescence was to be encouraged by a campaign of information and by mobilising convinced peasants to persuade recalcitrant ones but nothing could stop the tractors from moving in on the appointed day  Successful attempts to get local people to participate in official conservation programmes may have increased in post-colonial times but there are many cases of governments choosing coercion rather than participation for example 
The soil conservation efforts in Lesotho were no more successful in increasing agricultural output than were those installed by the British during the pre-independence period  And again since no erosion research data were collected their effects on soil losses are unknown 
But the record shows clearly that they were definitely more expensive and at least as disruptive of local village life as the earlier British programs had been  Nobe and Seckler 1979 157 
The case studies by Rapp Berry and Temple 1973 which were referred to earlier in this chapter also illustrate all the major reasons for failure of conservation in Tanganyika and post-colonial Tanzania technical incompetence and incompatibility with existing agricultural practice has already been mentioned also attempts at coercion of peasants to build erosion works p. 1 17 250 and a lack of participation with an excess of petty restrictions p. 251  Even where the government pays for the mechanical means of conservation entirely and thus avoids the problems of a lack of capital or labour on the part of the farmer his inability to forgo food crops for a season and the reduction of his perception of the risks involved even if his private resources are sufficient such an act engenders apathy on the part of the farmer who regards the work as belonging to the state FAO 1966 172 for a project in Morocco 
e  Institutional weaknesses 
These causes of failure are attributed to problems at the top although of course these must be linked to problems further down particularly of lack of participation of local people inappropriate conservation measures local enforcement and so on  It perhaps seems the easiest problem to tackle if the viewer also is located somewhere near the top e.g. a foreign advisor international academic or senior bureaucrat or politician in the country involved 
This perhaps explains the predominance of recommendations for institutional reform compared with the other deeper-seated changes in civil society which are implied and later analysed in this book  A commonly recognised problem is a lack of coordination in conservation policy which comes about because the wide-ranging issues implied in its brief are traditionally dealt with by separate line ministries 
Here soil conservation does not stand alone in this and rural development in general suffers from the same problems which have generated a large literature in the improvement of planning and administrative systems  In some cases there are competing institutions for policy-making and implementation of soil conservation such as in FAO itself as in many governments of lesser developed countries 
In response to this a separate central organisation with special powers is often suggested  Sandbach 1980 cites a United Nations Environment Programme UNEP report published in 1976 which states that seventy countries had created central organisations concerned with the environment 
For example at the time of writing every nation in South America except Paraguay has such an institution  A different but not exclusive approach is to insist upon a conservation element being included in most rural development projects 
This is sometimes quite difficult if funded by governments but even more so if funded by bilateral aid where the donor may have its own ideas on the subject  Furthermore they may be different ones from other bilateral or multilateral agencies making a coordinated national conservation programme rather difficult 
The case of Nepal illustrates this  In 1982 there were sixteen forestry/conservation projects and conservation elements in six integrated rural development projects each with a different donor agency 
Some of these are included in the Sixth Five Year Plan and some of which have been tacked on to ad hoc annual plans  There are scarcely monitored nor integrated into a national conservation plan 
In Kenya a new Ministry of the Environment and other far-reaching institutional reforms are currently before parliament  Inter-departmental squabbles are blamed for failures in India Bali 1974 Ranganathan 1978 
Effective legislation is another area of institutional strengthening often advocated  Although there are many laws on the statute book often dating from colonial administration they have either become dead letters or are not integrated into a coherent national conservation programme FAO Soils Bulletin No. 30 1976b lists various legislation for different countries 
Indeed many of the conservation statutes in Kenya Zambia Zimbabwe and Tanzania which the post-colonial governments have resurrected or only slightly redrafted date from the British administration  These statutes were ironically among the main foci of opposition during those countries ' independence movements 
In the case of Thailand legislation has been on the statute books for at least twenty years but its Constitution of October 1976 and Interim Constitution of November 1977 contain no mention of environmental protection at all as also is the case of the Philippines Shane in MacAndrews and Chia Lin Sien eds. 1979  However from evidence cited by Shane ibid it is not so much the lack of legislation but the unwillingness or inability of governments to enforce existing measures adequately which is the more fundamental problem 
Conservation techniques do not conserve soil in practice because of technical failures through inadequate or misapplied research  These range from the collapse of concrete-walled and widened terraces constructed by the Israelis in occupied territories Bunyard 1980 to repeated failure of inflexible concrete check dams nowadays frequently replaced by gabion breached bunds inadequate storm channels and inadequate knowledge of the requirements and performance of grasses and trees 
Other examples include Nobe and Seckler for Lesotho 1979 Robinson for Zambia 1978a 1978b Coulson 1981 Rapp 1975 and Rapp et al.  1973 
Conservation techniques do not fit into agricultural and pastoral practices and therefore are not applied by farmers or pastoralists  An extended example of local conservation techniques being neglected or even discouraged and government initiated ones being encouraged and later on forced upon the local population is given by Berry and Townshend 1973 
Table 4.2 adapted and added to the original ibid 246 indicates the techniques their origin and their acceptance  One or two extra and up-dated pieces of information are supplied Eco-Systems 1982 
Inspection of Table 4.2 shows that those techniques already practised by local farmers which the colonial government also encouraged and wished to extend were accepted  Those introduced by government which were similar to those already employed e.g. contour ridging were also accepted 
Others ran into practical difficulties  For example contour banks in the Mbeya region led to rat infestation wide grass strips and contour hedges often used up too much land 
Boxed and broad-based terraces required an enormous amount of labour reduced yields and proved unstable  Coercion had to be used to get local farmers to undertake these technically dubious measures 
Many conservation schemes in southern and central Africa demanded a reduction in stocking rates and thus in the major form of storage of wealth capital and prestige Stocking 1981a for Swaziland Cliffe 1964 in Tanzania  In Java Pickering 1979 reports in detail problems of the same kind 
Ridge and tree planting on very steep slopes met resistance when the trees grew enough to shade food crops planted in between and were savagely pruned back  Constant supervision of seedling trees was also a problem 
However this technique was better accepted on poorer lands where food crops were less attractive relative to fuelwood  Bench terraces were technically effective but ran into problems with the marginal farmer who was unable to sustain the temporary loss of food crops which terracing usually entails 
Lastly a scheme for silvipasture involving quite an intricate technology combining livestock-rearing fodder grasses and fuelwood needed considerable capital and physical back-up on the part of farmers the larger operators of whom were successful  Bonsu 1981 reports the results of experiments to reduce erosion in a savannah soil of northern Ghana by means of a number of agronomic practices including the leaving of crop residues as a mulch 
One wonders how successful this was bearing in mind that residues are used there to feed livestock as fuel to cook food and to construct roofs for houses  Indeed one could posit the hypothesis that this technique if enforced would put more pressure on sparse thorn/acacia resources or possibly animal dung as cooking fuel rather than as a fertiliser 
The commonly promoted answer to these problems is more research into the decisions and practices of users UN Desertification Conference Nairobi 1977  This is perhaps one of the few areas in which more research may provide genuinely useful insights for more realistic conservation programmes 
Conservation is hampered by existing land tenure conditions  In many countries with very unequal land holdings land reform is considered an essential prerequisite to a successful soil conservation programme e.g. Baker 1980 for Peru and Eckholm 1976 55 in order to encourage secure and long leases of land so that tenants would invest in conservation and in some cases provide marginal farmers with more land and therefore income to be able to afford conservation measures FAO 1977a 27 
Eckholm 1976 55 recounts the case in Ethiopia before the land reform of 1975 when peasants forced to work on a reafforestation project planted the seedlings upside-down as a protest against oppressive land tenure conditions  This example shows the indirect effects of tenure upon the attitude of subordinated peasants who had to plant trees on someone else 's land 
The same author goes on to say that there are cases where land reform or at least the break-up of large latifundia or estates had actually accelerated environmental decline as in Bolivia in the 1950s or after the emancipation of serfs in Russia in 1816  The major constraints which tenure conditions impose upon conservation programmes that discourage private initiatives to invest in conservation practices are short leases which tempt the tenant to remove as much plant material and nutrients as possible from the soil within the period of tenancy insecurity of tenants in longer leases uncertainty of compensation to tenants by landlords for conservation works at the end of the lease and a lack of an accepted means by which landlord and tenant can share these outlays in the first place Barlowe 1958 
A lack of participation by land-users in government sponsored conservation  This explanation clearly overlaps the previous one where conservation cuts across existing agricultural and pastoral practices 
Presumably preliminary consultation by conservation agencies and institutional involvement of local people in plan formulation and implementation would avoid these clashes  However it goes further than that and implies a lack of awareness of the need for conservation of future private benefits for individual households and the village or larger local community as a whole leading to a failure to mobilise people to give their labour for construction even when it will be paid for for maintenance work and for enforcement where discipline is required to control lopping of small seedlings to exclude livestock from reafforested and other areas and so on 
Bringing about community participation in forestry programmes would usually require a more equal pattern of land ownership and control than exists in most LDC 's that is require redistributive land reform  Cooperation is rarely found to succeed amongst those who are unequal in material terms since it becomes difficult both to ensure an equal distribution of costs and benefits 
Agarawal 1980 161  Bringing about community participation in forestry programmes would usually require a more equal pattern of land ownership and control than exists in most LDC 's that is require redistributive land reform 
Cooperation is rarely found to succeed amongst those who are unequal in material terms since it becomes difficult both to ensure an equal distribution of costs and benefits  Agarawal 1980 161 
This is an important but different explanation from that which attributes failure of conservation programmes to the conservation agency e.g. the Ministry of Forestry the Environment or ad hoc project staff being ineffective in getting local people to cooperate with them  Indeed internal dissensions between different groups of local people may lead to indifference on their part to government personnel and their efforts but the causes and remedies of the two explanations are different 
In Nepal a number of inequalities in the distribution of costs and benefits of various conservation programmes and related projects for increasing agricultural and fuelwood production can be identified Blaikie 1981 1983  Households with less privately-owned land which had to rely on the public economy the forest for livestock rearing rather than private land were less willing to see restrictions placed upon access to forests or to others ' private land for stubble grazing in cases where fodder tree planting on terrace backs was being advocated 
According to one source it was an immensely slow and difficult process for the British and Nepalese project personnel to get the village panchayat village council to agree to communal efforts necessary for conservation seed replication programmes seedling nurseries terrace improvements terrace-back planting woodfuel lot planting and stock improvement because of the vissiparious effects of perceived and real different costs and benefits of various parts of the scheme  This was used as one of the major defences of the British aid programme in Nepal which was to concentrate their efforts in villages with a predominant presence of ex-Gurkha soldiers which would encourage both better rapport between British field officers and farmers as well as an ex- army-style sense of organisation discipline and work-practice within the village itself 
In these villages it was argued a lack of common purpose would be less pronounced  Taking a counter-example the success of a project reported by Veblen 1978 for an area in western Guatemala was attributed to the institution of communal forest holdings or ejido which has favoured preservation of the forests of Totonicapan 
Communal overexploitation was averted first because of inter-personal face-to-face relationships involved in the design and implementation of forest preservation by a small community where enforcement and the meting out of punishments was a matter for the forest users themselves second because of the existence of a special interest group carpenters and third the shared and fierce desire of the people to remain as independent of outside influence and control as possible p. 434  Another isolated success story is reported by Shaxson 1981 reported in Morgan 1981 in India where a village finally decided to restore its hill-grazing area and plant fuelwood trees the scheme being designed and implemented locally 
It is instructive to compare these accounts with another proposed project FAO/UNDP reported by Velloso 1981 in Honduras where an effective linkage between the community and Honduran entrepreneurs for the proper exploitation and industrialisation of forests was hoped for  The Comayagua Plan includes a hydroelectric plant to fuel a planned woodpulp and paper factory an experimental nursery to test possible future forest products and the creation of employment opportunities to compensate local people for the necessary reduction in their livestock rearing 
The achievement of local participation seems very remote and a lion 's share of the benefits will probably accrue to more powerful elements entrepreneurs and outsiders  Other more coercive measures are almost bound to be used when participation breaks down a general issue which will be returned to later 
Turning to the relationship between direct land-users and conservation agents lack of participation of the former has been attributed to governments not involving the people in the design and implementation of the project  Where government introduces measures that exclude people from resources long since used by them the people come to view the project as a zero-sum game Thomson in Glantz ed. 1977 where their loss is exactly others ' gain and conservation will not in the long run lead to an increase in their incomes 
A lack of government efforts to involve local people is often contributory to the design of projects which cut across existing agricultural practices and tenurial arrangements  But also in another sense conservation has frequently been seen as an imposition so much so that many local people rioted formed armed resistance and used the issue as a nucleus for organising wide-ranging political dissent in eastern Africa against the British colonial administration Young and Fosbrooke 1960 Cliffe 1964 
In the colonial context the word participation had an uncomfortable ring about it quite alien to the ideology of the political status quo and the colonial administration and agricultural extension service knowing what was good for the African cultivator  Another example in Algeria shortly after independence is discussed by Stewart 1975 31 
The central criticism of the 1960 programme has always been directed against its allegedly authoritarian character  The treatment was to be decided by experts and the people had simply to accept it 
Their acquiescence was to be encouraged by a campaign of information and by mobilising convinced peasants to persuade recalcitrant ones but nothing could stop the tractors from moving in on the appointed day  The central criticism of the 1960 programme has always been directed against its allegedly authoritarian character

Successful attempts to get local people to participate in official conservation programmes may have increased in post-colonial times but there are many cases of governments choosing coercion rather than participation for example  The soil conservation efforts in Lesotho were no more successful in increasing agricultural output than were those installed by the British during the pre-independence period 
And again since no erosion research data were collected their effects on soil losses are unknown  But the record shows clearly that they were definitely more expensive and at least as disruptive of local village life as the earlier British programs had been

And again since no erosion research data were collected their effects on soil losses are unknown  But the record shows clearly that they were definitely more expensive and at least as disruptive of local village life as the earlier British programs had been 
Nobe and Seckler 1979 157  The case studies by Rapp Berry and Temple 1973 which were referred to earlier in this chapter also illustrate all the major reasons for failure of conservation in Tanganyika and post-colonial Tanzania technical incompetence and incompatibility with existing agricultural practice has already been mentioned also attempts at coercion of peasants to build erosion works p. 1 17 250 and a lack of participation with an excess of petty restrictions p. 251 
Even where the government pays for the mechanical means of conservation entirely and thus avoids the problems of a lack of capital or labour on the part of the farmer his inability to forgo food crops for a season and the reduction of his perception of the risks involved even if his private resources are sufficient such an act engenders apathy on the part of the farmer who regards the work as belonging to the state FAO 1966 172 for a project in Morocco  Institutional weaknesses 
These causes of failure are attributed to problems at the top although of course these must be linked to problems further down particularly of lack of participation of local people inappropriate conservation measures local enforcement and so on  It perhaps seems the easiest problem to tackle if the viewer also is located somewhere near the top e.g. a foreign advisor international academic or senior bureaucrat or politician in the country involved 
This perhaps explains the predominance of recommendations for institutional reform compared with the other deeper-seated changes in civil society which are implied and later analysed in this book  A commonly recognised problem is a lack of coordination in conservation policy which comes about because the wide-ranging issues implied in its brief are traditionally dealt with by separate line ministries 
Here soil conservation does not stand alone in this and rural development in general suffers from the same problems which have generated a large literature in the improvement of planning and administrative systems  In some cases there are competing institutions for policy-making and implementation of soil conservation such as in FAO itself as in many governments of lesser developed countries 
In response to this a separate central organisation with special powers is often suggested  Sandbach 1980 cites a United Nations Environment Programme UNEP report published in 1976 which states that seventy countries had created central organisations concerned with the environment 
For example at the time of writing every nation in South America except Paraguay has such an institution  A different but not exclusive approach is to insist upon a conservation element being included in most rural development projects 
This is sometimes quite difficult if funded by governments but even more so if funded by bilateral aid where the donor may have its own ideas on the subject  Furthermore they may be different ones from other bilateral or multilateral agencies making a coordinated national conservation programme rather difficult 
The case of Nepal illustrates this  In 1982 there were sixteen forestry/conservation projects and conservation elements in six integrated rural development projects each with a different donor agency 
Some of these are included in the Sixth Five Year Plan and some of which have been tacked on to ad hoc annual plans  There are scarcely monitored nor integrated into a national conservation plan 
In Kenya a new Ministry of the Environment and other far-reaching institutional reforms are currently before parliament  Inter-departmental squabbles are blamed for failures in India Bali 1974 Ranganathan 1978 
Effective legislation is another area of institutional strengthening often advocated  Although there are many laws on the statute book often dating from colonial administration they have either become dead letters or are not integrated into a coherent national conservation programme FAO Soils Bulletin No. 30 1976b lists various legislation for different countries 
Indeed many of the conservation statutes in Kenya Zambia Zimbabwe and Tanzania which the post-colonial governments have resurrected or only slightly redrafted date from the British administration  These statutes were ironically among the main foci of opposition during those countries ' independence movements 
In the case of Thailand legislation has been on the statute books for at least twenty years but its Constitution of October 1976 and Interim Constitution of November 1977 contain no mention of environmental protection at all as also is the case of the Philippines Shane in MacAndrews and Chia Lin Sien eds. 1979  However from evidence cited by Shane ibid it is not so much the lack of legislation but the unwillingness or inability of governments to enforce existing measures adequately which is the more fundamental problem 
The response to these five perceived difficulties has been various  At the most analytically simple the difficulties remain as unexplored discrete entities or black boxes which then have to be removed or steered round in the formulation of a conservation project or policy 
In rather the same way as in some Basic Needs Strategies a checklist of desirable attributes of a good strategy can be compiled Blaikie Cameron & Seddon 1979  A drawback to this response is that merely bearing a desirable attribute in mind does not necessarily remove the problem 
Its advantage is that it is at least problem-orientated and gives the impression which is sometimes justified that one has the means to solve it  The more abstract the mode of analysis of the problem and therefore the more connected the items on the check-list become the less likely that one can solve them alone 
However even a rudimentary enquiry into the problems discussed above shows that they are connected in obvious ways  Local participation is achieved because and as a result of appropriate conservation measures which do not cut across existing practices and irreducible means of earning a livelihood 
Effective programme formulation and implementation by government to provide external inputs to appropriate skills is essential for local participation and implies effective and coordinated administration and so on  Furthermore all the items on the check-list themselves such as local participation effective administration by government and consonance between conservation measures and existing agricultural and pastoral practice require deep-seated political economic preconditions 
Community participation in conservation can occur under a variety of different circumstances but one can identify some that make it easier  For example inequalities of political power and access to land should not substantially weight the costs and benefits of conservation measures to or from particular groups or classes at the local level 
Also there should be an effective and widely respected authority which can solve disputes and give penalties in the case of infringement of mutually agreed codes of practice  Finally there should be a trusting two-way communication between externally provided skills e.g. water engineers agronomists planners and local land-users 
These three facilitating conditions are predicated upon the nature of the local political economy-who has power and how it is exercised upon the nature of the state and the interests and ideology of people who serve in government e.g. bureaucrats forest police or politicians  Hence there is a painful dilemma for the policy-maker between treating a problem as a black box which will not go away but whose size does not seem intimidating and is amenable to exorcism by benign rhetoric and minor policy adjustments or as a more diffuse analytically complex and sophisticated explanation of why most of the problems exist 
The choice that this book tends towards is the second and the ensuing problems are discussed in Chapter 5  The discussion so far does not imply that piecemeal improvements of conservation programmes have not occurred 
While research on the agronomic side of conservation has taken considerable strides during the past fifteen years for all its problems of misapplication there have also been some advances in the thinking on the socio-economic side of soil erosion and the resulting design of conservation programmes as well  This is particularly important in the ideological vacuum which was left by the retreat of empire from Africa and Asia where much soil conservation had been designed by colonial administration 
Three different ways can be identified in which piecemeal improvements to the conceptualisation of the soil erosion problem have been transcended  They are a a new attempt to understand the interrelatedness of the current problems that beset conservation policies b to stimulate flows of information between land-users and institutions of government and c linking conservation with wider development efforts 
An awareness of the way in which the reasons for erosion are connected has implied the necessity for inter-disciplinary study  This has led to a change in the way in which both physical and social data are collected and combined in an effective conservation policy or as Pickering 1979 puts it in such a way as to ensure the technical validity of a conservation technique is appropriate over the same area as its social validity 
One approach is to hire a sociologist to peer into the black box the quotation from Heusch 1981 423 and p. 46 in this book about the role of the sociologist is apposite here in a similar way to anthropologists who sought to tell colonial administrators how to avoid irritating the people they governed although according to Feuchtwang 1973 the administrators did not take much notice of what they had to say  It is the experience of other sociologists on similar missions that their findings are frequently cast in a negative role that certain conservation measures will not succeed or will actually do harm and also that they are frequently overridden or relegated to writing a disparate chapter in a project document or report entitled Social constraints to soil and water conservation 
Under these circumstances at least a gesture towards listening to the local people has been made  In other reports however these findings are actually incorporated into a project or programme although whether those parts of the project are actually implemented is another matter 
Another approach to handling inter-disciplinarity is to educate agricultural engineers and administrators into the way of being sympathetic at least to these social factors  A recent publication spells out the need for more inter-disciplinary awareness UNESCO 1979a 5 
Engineers are often most concerned with the attainments of a high level or technical competence which has resulted in the gradual erosion of the general level of social awareness and perspective necessary for an engineer to serve his community usefully  There are numerous examples where there has been an effort to apply an engineering solution to a problem without taking adequate account of all its parameters tube-wells and salination road building and rural income distribution

Seminars courses systems analysis panel discussions case studies and simulations are some of the solutions suggested  How far this approach can hope to have an impact is rather doubtful 
Also engineers are singled out here as the culprits when it could well have been social and technically incompetent scientists  Lastly inter-disciplinarity is assisted not only in the logistics of using knowledge but in the epistemology and methodology of that knowledge itself 
Here systems analysis has helped considerably  Such works as Odum 1971 Dumsday 1971 Dumsday and Flynn 1977 and Rieger 1978â€“9a & b are examples in that field 
Systems analysis has important advantages in that it can handle both complex biophysical relationships which is more difficult in a rigid mathematical programming approach and can include the effects of policy instruments and other hitherto exogenous social and economic variables  The disadvantages are that the technique is very ambitious is sensitive to data inaccuracies and incompleteness and technical problems of model validation are formidable 
However even if it is a matter of putting different variables in boxes on a sheet of paper and following through likely relationships qualitatively a far cry from what is usually meant by systems analysis it is a further intellectual advance on the black box approach to social factors  Fig. 4.2 from Rieger 1978/9a is an example of this approach 
It gives a good intellectual overview of the problem and a map in which can be located detailed close-up studies which at the same time do not lose sight of the general context in which they are made  In the context of lesser developed countries with acute problems of data collection and interpretation a systems approach rather than systems analysis will be more viable 
Modelling farming decisions by means of farming systems research is also another promising avenue  In this approach farming decisions are not analysed in isolation from each other or from non-farm employment something which is advocated in Ch. 5 especially and operationalised in a decision-making model in Ch. 6 
The second trend in current conservation thinking concerns the relationship between the programme and its clients or government and land-users and has taken a number of different forms  New thinking in rural development planning in general has only been taken up piecemeal by conservation planners and commentators in the international literature and they have been idealistic and exhortative in tone 
Chambers 1983 forthcoming and in shorter form 1980 a and b has exhorted government officials to be aware that in developing countries poor rural people and rural poverty in general are underperceived or misperceived by those who themselves are neither poor nor rural  The most relevant aspect of his advice concerns rural tourism as one inevitable relationship between government and the rural people which introduces biases in development programmes in which the poorer are neglected because they are inescapably the most remote and difficult to reach and in which university education and professional training blinker and condition researchers and planners so that they see problems of poverty in terms of their own specialisation and through filters of supposedly superior knowledge and status 
French 1982 specifies ten commandments for renewable energy analysis which has much of the same spirit as the advice of Chambers  These are do not harm be reality led and not technology-driven filter your data well find net present value set your calendar to local time master the unquantifiable be replicable provide no subsidies keep track of what you do and think small 
Most of these homilies and others of this genre are most relevant to conservation planners and are discussed indirectly elsewhere in this book  This is an appeal deriving from a politically specific stance which is liberal in outlook implying the importance of improving living conditions for the poor and from the ability of the aware and self-critical planner to do it through the state machinery 
Other developments of better government outreach to rural land-users advocate the need for more local research although the methodology of local research remains unspecified  Chapters 6 and 7 attempt to develop one which enables local situations to be studied in relation to wider concerns and to use ugly but accurate jargon to theorise the conjuncture 
Such calls have be.en made by Hudson 1981 for conservation although they are far more frequently made by agricultural economists and agronomists who are concerned with interactive research by farmers and research stations Biggs 1981  A top-down comment by Holdgate 1982 also makes a plea for relevant local research which can be applied and its resulting policies replicated 
Lastly conservation has been seen as just one element in rural development efforts and conservation elements have been linked with agricultural extension institutional development cooperatives regulated markets government-supplied services and so on and the provision of infrastructure storage roads buildings etc  Adamson et al 
1982  This has one most significant aspect in that soil conservation is not singled out as a specific and separate problem to be solved by a particular policy it is conceived of as normal practice and must be incorporated into the business of improving incomes for farmers 
Many integrated rural development projects have conservation elements built into them but judging by evaluation reports these are acknowledged to be difficult to measure slow to bring benefits and are often neglected or abandoned  Many bilateral and multilateral aid agencies have rightly upgraded the importance of monitoring and evaluation in their activities and as Chapter 2 has indicated quantification and measurement of the impact of soil conservation are essential 
None the less diffuse benefits from conservation accruing over a long-time horizon and targeted very widely among the rural population are poor candidates for adoption and funding  What can not be justified quantitatively can not command large resources 
Thus the inclusion of conservation elements in rural development projects tends to be more a conceptual advance than a practical one and to be an item in a project document rather than an output  All these three new developments are in the direction which this book advocates but they do not go nearly far enough 
A further extension of these new developments requires a new approach to the whole issue of erosion and conservation  This approach must first identify and question three fundamental assumptions on which most conservation thinking currently rests 
These are  a 
The causes of the problem of soil erosion lie only in the actual place in which the physical symptoms are felt  A new approach must also recognise they also derive from wider non-location-specific political-economic relations and also in other places that may be far from the affected area 
b  Soil conservation programmes and policies particularly those formulated by expatriates assume the state to be neutral able to mediate between competing interests and to intervene above them to apply rational policies for the maximum aggregate benefit 
Thus conservation problems can be more readily solved by better planning carried out by the apparatus of state ministries of agriculture local development offices forest rangers or research stations  c 
Putting a and b together another related assumption becomes clear  Land-using practices are economic activities in which political-economic relations may be crucial e.g. the ownership of the land the distribution of that ownership the crops grown for the market or for self-provisioning the existence of wage labour and so on 
Conservation policies must affect these relations  Some of those involved lose some win others will be unaffected 
Economic and political interests are therefore affected in the countryside and in the government  By not considering these interests explicitly most thinking on conservation policy can not link conservation with a whole set of wider issues deeply embedded in the patterns of power within a state 
In the next chapter these assumptions are further questioned and new ones are suggested  Upon these a new approach is constructed

In the next chapter these assumptions are further questioned and new ones are suggested  Upon these a new approach is constructed 
One of the major problems of building a theory of soil erosion is the high degree of contingency which always accompanies any explanation of soil erosion at a particular place  As Chapter 2 has indicated soil erosion has occurred in many different societies and periods of history in feudal Europe the Soviet Union Tsarist Russia the United States in the 1930s and in present-day peasantries and under widely differing physical conditions 
Essentially in an explanation of a case of soil erosion there are two sets of specificity to be tackled that of the physical system and that of the social/economic system and they both have to be brought together and analytically integrated  An omission of the first would lead to a failure to specify the physical processes of soil erosion their spatial variability and interaction and indeed the immediate causal variables such as slope soil structure vegetative cover land use rainfall intensity and so on 
To take an extreme illustrative case one can imagine a situation where broadly similar relationships exist between direct land-users pastoralists or peasants and other groups and the state and they develop historically in a steep-sloped area and in a plains area nearby  In the steep-sloped area a situation might have developed where overgrazing and deforestation occurred as a result of onerous taxation and loss of land to colonisers leading to virtual environmental collapse 
The same economic and social conditions in the plains area might have led only to loss of soil fertility but not to wholesale soil erosion and environmental collapse  Therefore the subsequent histories of the two areas will diverge and a different relation between environment and people will develop in each of the two areas 
In this illustration a very obvious physiographic variable can not be ignored and is integral as part of the explanation as well as an explanation for human action  The omission of the second the social/economic system leads to a purely technocratic and physical study of the processes of soil erosion and perhaps the immediate land-uses leading to it without any analysis of other political economic relationships at the local regional and international scales which determine the actions of the land-user in the affected area 
The two elements tend to lie in different scientific paradigms  The first is typically within the purview of the natural sciences and is the subject matter of agricultural engineers and soil scientists while the second is within the social sciences and is studied by economists and sociologists 
There are considerable epistemological and ideological problems involved in the combination of these two elements and these are discussed later  There is also another separation of intellectual concerns which must be brought together in an integrated analysis of soil erosion and conservation 
There is the concern for the physical manifestation of the problem a place-based concern for where it occurs  This tends to focus on the physical symptoms of soil erosion and finds its expression in maps of soil loss or erosion hazard but it also includes other spatial tangible variables such as land use stocking densities and the geographical expression of the flow of energy between people and the biosphere 
Therefore it is location-specific place-based and conjunctural  There are three ways in which the place-based location-specific element is relevant to any analysis of soil erosion 
First it clearly focuses on where the physical symptoms of the problem are  At smaller geographical scales it is physiographic variables those describing erodibility and erosivity which best explain the spatial variations of soil erosion 
This is the conventional and essential domain of soil erosion studies as presently conceived  Second a place-based concern must be directed to the study of other places where perhaps there is no visible soil erosion problem but where there are processes of spatial displacement of land-users 
For example efficiently run coffee estates which conserve soil well can cause soil erosion in other places by displacing small peasants  A capital intensive fruit plantation in the valley floor of a central American Republic can cause soil erosion on hillsides which are being cultivated by peasants who have been dispossessed of more suitable land for cultivation 
In Lesotho forestry programmes have taken grazing land out of use causing immediate pressure on remaining land without a displacement of the actual homes of land-users  Third other places which feel the effect of soil erosion downstream in the form of deposition and floods must also be part of the place-based analytical concern for soil erosion for two reasons 
First and more obviously direct curative measures e.g. flood protection clearly are within the domain of a soil conservation policy  Second there may be various political reasons for including these areas in a comprehensive analysis for accounting purposes 
For example the benefits of a soil conservation programme will be felt not only by the direct land users who are causing the soil erosion but by others who may be subjected to less severe crop losses deposition of gravel on cultivated land loss of livestock and building or siltation of canal irrigation networks  Therefore political and economic accounting of the costs and benefits of soil conservation programmes for others outside the directly affected areas is potentially relevant 
Sometimes those persons may live in a different country as in the case of Nepal and India for example which may well create both problems and opportunities for the funding and joint cooperation of soil conservation ventures  An estimated $US600 m. annual damage occurs in India due to flooding and siltation much of which is caused in Himalayan watersheds in Nepal Gribbin 1982 Thompson and Warburton 1982 
There is also the concern of the non-place-based or non-location specific networks of economic social and political relations acting directly and indirectly upon land users  It concerns relations between people and not just between the direct land users and the environment 
Land-users are taxed sell their produce in the market work for or employ others have unequal access to land or other agricultural inputs and are part of the processes of agrarian change such as commercialisation accumulation disinvestment and differentiation  Many of these relations directly or indirectly affect land using decisions which lead to environmental degradation 
It is these processes which are amenable to the analysis of political economy and involve the objective identification of different economic interests in the countryside as well as the town  It is true that these processes may well have a spatial expression in a specific situation but there are others to which it is difficult to attribute any physical manifestation or by definition which can not have a spatial expression at all 
For example the state may regulate the ownership of land through land tenure or give foreign franchises and concessions and may pursue national pricing policies for agricultural produce  These processes too are subject to political and economic analyses and are often intimately bound up with land-users who are responsible for accelerated soil erosion 
Both these elements are needed in an understanding of soil erosion conservation but hitherto it is only the first which has usually been considered and only in the first of the three location-specific senses at that  These social factors then are part of both the place-based and non-place-based concerns described above 
In the former they find expression in land-use patterns the spatial patterns of agricultural technology including the diffusion of innovations price-distance relationships of inputs and outputs spatial patterns of size of landholdings and other more complex eco-class relationships invoking spatial displacement and marginalisation of weaker groups which will be discussed later  In the latter they are the political-economic structures within 
which land-use decisions are made  A check-list of these social factors is given below but any analysis of the processes mentioned above will combine the items of the check-list 
Following a bottom-up analytical approach we start with the smallest decision-making unit which uses land usually centred on a hearth involving a family extended family or occasionally a larger unit  This unit is the smallest one which collectively makes decisions about its allocation of labour and other privately controlled resources though it may not necessarily own them in the sense implied by private property 
There will be definitional and ultimately theoretical problems in a few cases where land-use decisions are shared in a complex manner between a small group like a household and a larger community  However in the majority of cases we are talking about a household constituting a nuclear or extended family or a pastoral group controlling a flock or herd 
Although land-use decisions are made by the household these may well not be made equally by all members of it and this may be significant in the perception of conservation and any government sponsored conservation programme  So a prior starting point should be the politics within the household itself 
The general division of labour in peasant and pastoral households is significant it is women who frequently collect water fuel forest litter and fodder and indeed in some societies do most of the agricultural work as well except ploughing as for example in parts of South Asia  However cropping decisions the purchase of inputs and marketing are often done by men with important exceptions for example in West Africa 
In cases where women and the children they directly control collect forest products of one type or another it is they who are most aware of any deterioration in resource availability but who are often an inaccessible but important target group in agricultural extension efforts to get conservation methods accepted  There are other possible inequalities within the household frequently concerning both gender and age 
In many societies it is the older males including the head of household who allocate labour control access of young men to women for marriage and make other major decisions  It is their voice which is heard and they often are the opinion-makers in the household and in the local community 
Their views frequently are less innovative not necessarily in a pejorative sense than the next generation over whom they have considerable control  Whatever the politics of decision-making within the household male dominated elder-dominated or more egalitarian it is usually necessary to pursue these enquiries first 
At the level of the household land-use decisions are often only a sub-sector in a range of income opportunities and this range has to be fully specified to include the most common forms of income generation since land-use decisions are affected by these other forms  Thus non-agricultural activities should be considered alongside those which directly use land and this is particularly important where there is widespread rural-urban migration with or without a remittance economy e.g. South Yemen where outmigration to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf has led to the abandonment of terracing the Rif in Morocco and Algeria the Nepalese hills Lesotho and other labour reserves of Southern Africa or the Andean highlands where many of the male population have migrated seasonally or permanently to the coastal cities 
Chapter 6 formalises a decision-making model in which a household may take up a number of different income opportunities according to its capability and the entry costs of such opportunities  Many of these opportunities are expressed in terms of different crops and associated agricultural practices inter-cropping mulching or tie-ridging which have direct implications for soil erosion 
The political-economic structures behind the range of choices is the next necessary analytical step and opens up wider concerns at the local national and international level  At the local level certain decisions concerning land use and deployment of labour may be made by village councils whose range of authority extent of public acknowledgement of penalties acceptance by people and their distribution of power have to be considered 
Sometimes effective land-use management and watershed management requires a number of institutions of this kind to agree which may well be even more difficult because of unequal costs and benefits of conservation measures between different communities or villages  The nature and interrelationship between these entities is a difficult and debated subject and readers are referred to some of the best-known texts on the subject 
Here a simple conceptualisation as is serviceable for the purpose of this book is made and it follows the main elements of Miliband 's 1969  However it can not be proved or disproved in any final way and is unavoidably a political statement 
None the less it is necessary to make explicit what the state government and administration are and what they do  Many commentaries without such an explicit and analytical statement bewail the lack of political will expertise or rational planning without offering any explanation as to why these qualities frequently do not exist to carry out effective conservation 
First of all the definition of some terms is needed  The state is a most problematic term since as Miliband 1969 46 put it the state is not a thing and does not as such exist 
The state stands for in an abstract sense the final repository of agreement of the people to be ruled and therefore an ultimate legitimation backed up in the last instance by the state 's claim to the monopoly of legitimate use of force  So for example the inclusion of conservation principles in the constitution is a symbolic statement to which all people should give their allegiance and it is the duty of all governments to uphold and abide by it 
The government on the other hand speaks and acts in the name of the state  It may be a weak government and although formally invested with state power does not or can not use it 
The government or political executive has as its instrument for the business of governing the administration or bureaucracy which extends through the ministries and departments to a variety of institutions such as public corporations banks and others particularly the institutions of education and the media  The crucial difference between a social democratic view of the state and the one taken here is that we recognise that the bureaucracy itself is political in the course of exercising its executive powers particularly in the realm of policy-making at the upper levels and in implementation at the lower levels 
By extension then conservation practices left undone legislation remaining unheeded projects that only serve to keep research officers in salary and which never leave the experimental station those things not done are also political acts and not just omissions or non-events which do not need explaining  Although there still exists the notion that administration should be or is apolitical and merely a neutral tool of the government this is palpably not so in practically all states industrialised or less developed or socialist 
Senior civil servants have tremendous power particularly where government is weak changes are frequent or their political leaders lack technical or administrative expertise or have misplaced confidence  The administration itself is of course no monolith and does not act as a single bloc pursuing its interests whatever they may be 
At the top there are very senior bureaucrats who with their counterparts in the military and judiciary form a state elite  In some lesser developed countries particularly in central and east Africa it has been called a bureaucratic bourgeoisie a term which is discussed below 
Recruitment to its ranks is highly selective in terms of social and educational status and it perpetuates itself by spending parts of its accumulated surpluses on privileged education often abroad for its favoured sons and occasionally daughters  The term bureaucratic bourgeoisie to describe this state elite has certain problems and used strictly should refer to managers of state-owned enterprises 
However this class may actually enter into economic activities for private gain using for example its privileged position to secure credit at favourable rates of interest obtain monopolies and franchises in import and export businesses start up industrial enterprises speculate in urban property and so on for a debate about the bureaucracy in lesser developed countries see Coulson 1975 Leys 1975 193f  An example comes from Williams 1981 p.23 when he discusses the beneficiaries of a large World Bank project in Nigeria these rich beneficiaries are drawn from army officers government officials contractors merchants and members of the office-holding aristocracy who purchase land in anticipation of benefits from the project and from cheap bank credits 
In many countries this elite acts as the chief negotiator with transnational companies and therefore its members become beneficiaries from negotiations with logging contractors purchase of agricultural estates permission to sell agricultural inputs purchase of agricultural inputs and other policy measures  The distinction between individuals in government and the senior civil service banks and corporations is often more blurred than in western countries and therefore this elite tends to form a coherent and powerful set of economic interests although these may be contradictory and are usually very diverse and are not only represented in government but often are the government 
At the same time this is not to deny there are administrators and administrations which claim to act even want to act in a disinterested way  An analysis of Indian administrators Wood 1976 shows how the liberal democratic ideal of the disinterested administrator carrying out the orders of his political masters left him in independent India with relatively low-status and low-income compared to those in commerce or business 
This created a tendency for the administrator to facilitate the flow of benefits which the state frequently confers upon private enterprise to private businessmen for a return and indeed involve himself in a variety of legal and illegal activities for which the post of senior government servant is advantageous  Lastly after government the administration military and judiciary a fifth element of the system can be identified which Miliband 1969 calls the various units of sub-government in a sense the extension of central government but also a voice of the periphery and thus a channel of communication between the two 
This element is most readily identified in a federal structure such as the USA Brazil India or Nigeria but is also significant in local assemblies as well as in centres of district and regional administration  The politicians and bureaucrats at this level can have a profound effect upon the local people and can obstruct alter or intensify central government actions 
So the bureaucracy at this level will not necessarily fulfil the economic interests of its masters in any simple way  Only a small fraction of the bureaucracy can directly benefit from its position of high office and crucial monopoly or oligopoly in negotiations and policy-making 
All have career structures which have varying degrees of opportunity  For those at the lower and middle grades job security and risk-minimisation in decision-making may be their most important considerations in the execution of their duties since government employment in many lesser developed countries is relatively secure compared with other jobs available with special privileges such as pensions health services government schooling and housing 
At the lowest levels of the government machinery the village clerk the forest policeman and the agricultural extension agent there are additional contradictions  For these people day-to-day life is much more concerned with general social intercourse with farmers pastoralists small businessmen and local politicians chiefs headmen and so on 
As a result lower level or petty bureaucrats frequently have to rely upon local people for economic perks access to a small plot of land or to credit on favourable terms or the rent of a house  Local conservation officers forest guards and rangers therefore find that rational conservation policy is tempered by a web of social and economic relationships with various members of the public at the local level 
Thus considerations of job security avoidance of reprimand and conditions of work are further tempered by reciprocity and reliance upon local people  These various forms of differentiation within the bureaucracy are vital in the understanding of the formulation and implementation of conservation programmes 
Conservation programmes seldom bring opportunities for personal advancement for senior bureaucrats unlike other activities such as the issue of import-export licences the handling of foreign business and the control of access to state-controlled markets  Therefore in a positive sense conservation does not attract bureaucrats or quasi-official middlemen 
Indeed many mediocre and/or failed bureaucrats tend to be promoted to conservation by their more thrusting and successful colleagues  However conservation policies also affect the careers of bureaucrats and elements of sub-government in a negative sense putting them in difficult positions since these programmes usually include policy measures which are directly injurious to the interests of the state elite in their private economic capacities 
Usually conservation programmes and individual projects have a number of elements some contrary to the interests of the state elite others neutral and occasionally others which could provide opportunities e.g. contracts for earthworks labour recruitment for building of dams or tax advantages for conservation undertaken on private land  Also conservation programmes involve potential clashes with landowners politicians whose constituencies are adversely affected forest contractors who would like to fell trees without official controls and so on 
Lastly conservation programmes often fail and senior bureaucrats may have to take the blame  Having provided the briefest outline of the relationship between state government and state machinery let us show how it is helpful in the analysis of soil erosion and conservation 
First it provides a more convincing explanation of the failure of conservation than a lack of political will or powerful vested interests or other dark and unspecified reasons  There are clear reasons why state power should encompass the means to conserve soil reafforest and so on but why do governments not do it successfully 
Seeming contradictions can be explained in situations where conservation policies may be drawn up in some areas perhaps financed by foreign aid and attached to prestigious foreign fellowships and enhanced salaries for senior officials but in a neighbouring area a carte-blanche logging contract is offered to a transnational company  Successful conservation may well imply a cutback in commercial crops and therefore a reduction in foreign exchange on which the state elite depends for its imported luxuries foreign travel and education 
Where there is state intervention in food prices these tend to be low to favour a political alliance of various classes who live in towns  Pricing may well be a critical factor in returns to farmers and to decision-making about extension of cultivation and precise agronomic practices with direct implications for soil erosion and yet prices of foodstuffs for urban-based elites are naturally a highly sensitive political issue 
Thus what is done and what more commonly and significantly remains as rhetoric can be explained  Second this type of analysis shifts primary attention away from the preoccupation of conservation policy-makers academics and consultants with institution-building training government officers in environmental awareness tightening up and rationalisation of administrative and legislative procedures 
All these reforms may be necessary but alas so far from being sufficient that a reassessment of future conservation needs to be made  Empirical justification for this gloomy remark is all too evident in Chapters 2 and 3 
Third such analysis links national political-economic processes relevant to erosion and conservation to international affairs mediated in a great variety of ways by the state systems of different countries  Apart from the efforts of transnational companies already mentioned there are other strategic and financial considerations 
As was mentioned in Chapter 3 the American decision to sell grain once more to the Soviet Union in 1977 wiped out the Soil Bank established in the 1970s and caused ploughing up of marginal land and a marked increase in erosion rates Cook 1983  The American blockade of Cuba threw the latter 's post-revolutionary land-use planning into confusion and caused wholesale cultivation of food crops on very vulnerable steep slopes 
The deterioration of international relations between the USA and many Latin American countries saw the withdrawal of American aid which financed soil conservation efforts there  Lastly the effects of the world recession and specifically the price rise of oil in 1973 have put pressure upon national funding of conservation programmes encouraged the use of woodfuel or dung reduced artificial fertiliser application rates exacerbated the foreign exchange position of most lesser developed countries and discouraged government and private initiatives in conservation 
The advantage of the method of analysis suggested here is that these international influences are not treated as isolated and exogenous instances as if operated by deus ex machina but are explicable and connected within the context of the workings of the world economic system  These views are similar to those of Heyer Roberts and Williams 1981 who discuss rather broader issues of rural development 
They also stress that the assertion that rural development serves all or almost all interests is a necessary myth  The contradictions and convergences between national and international aid agencies have to be assessed in the design and implementation of rural development projects 
International organisations have to deal with governments who in most cases do not represent their peoples and certainly not the poor peasants p.2  One of the major reasons for the widespread failure of rural developments is that it usually does not serve the interests of the people at whom it is ostensibly aimed 
Instead it benefits big business contractors consultancies construction firms government officials international experts and academics  The point made here and in Heyer Roberts and Williams 1981 is that these conflicts of interest and how they are expressed in governments and outside have to be recognised 
In summary soil erosion problems can be analysed in a framework of Chinese boxes each fitting inside the other  The individual within a household the household itself the village or local community the local bureaucracy the bureaucracy government and nature of the state and finally international relations all represent contexts within which actions affecting soil erosion and conservation take place 
A specific analysis must identify these contexts and the relationships between them  It is when the physical phenomenon of soil erosion affects people so that they have to respond and adapt their mode of life that it becomes also a social phenomenon 
When this response affects others and brings about a clash of interests and it usually does except in areas of extreme remoteness and low population density it becomes a political phenomenon as well  In this section we examine the clash of interests which soil erosion brings about and we ask whose interests they are and how they are pursued in the face of conflict 
The major determinant of the response to soil erosion is the degree of political power of the class(es) or group(s) involved  Starting with classes and groups with very little power indeed their response is the weakest 
For those such as the rural semi-proletariat and the absolutely landless with little control over the means of production with which to meet their needs even individual responses are denied them  In essence their class position often forces them into using the environment destructively and inhibits any adaptive response to its inevitable deterioration 
Any individual act of self-denial or investment e.g. leaving small saplings to regenerate the forest or investing in an improved method of cooking food is frequently not repaid a classic tragedy of the commons does not respect individual and isolated remedial action  Peasants and pastoralists who have more control over the use of private land and/or flocks can carry out both new agricultural practices mulching inter-cropping zero-tillage or improved cultivation and invest in private erosion works such as terraces bunds gully-head protection etc 
However political action is required to tackle the more systemic and widespread symptoms of environmental deterioration such as the destruction of the forest wholesale sheet erosion across a large area or the threatened collapse of a whole tier of paddy terraces  It is then that a conflict of interests may arise 
It may arise simply because the risk of deterioration of a resource may be unequally shared among affected people or because the fruits of personal sacrifices will be enjoyed by others or discounted future benefits do not justify present sacrifices and are distributed unevenly  For example labour inputs for erosion works and temporary dislocation of food production fuel supplies and fodder for livestock may be borne by one group more than another 
Very often those without enough political power to influence the course of events resulting from erosion and from official conservation programmes are those who are politically subordinated in other related ways  For example in Mali resources flow from the poor peasant to the urban sector where a variety of powerful classes live and realise that surplus 
A state marketing system gives derisory prices for commodities produced by peasants and later exported to earn foreign exchange spent by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and other privileged classes or consumed as foodstuffs at cheap prices  However 80 per cent of the revenue generated is spent on civil service salaries and yet the government by imprecation if not implication blames this peasantry for sheet and gully erosion 
Lipton 1977 1982 in his thesis of urban bias while being strongly criticised on various grounds has many examples of this phenomenon  He paraphrases his thesis as follows 
Small interlocking urban elites comprising mainly businessmen politicians bureaucrats trade-union leaders and a supporting staff of professionals academics and intellectuals can in a modern state substantially control the distribution of resources  In the great majority of developing countries such urban elites spearheaded the fight against the colonizing power 
Partly for this reason urban elites formed and have since dominated the institutions of independence government political parties law civil service trade unions education business organisations and many more  But the power of the urban elite in a modern state is determined not by its economic role alone but by its capacity to organise centralise and control 
Rural people while much more numerous than urban people are also much more dispersed poor inarticulate and unorganised  That does not make them quiescent but it does diffuse their conflicts

That does not make them quiescent but it does diffuse their conflicts  Lipton in Harriss 1982 
Moving now to collective political responses the problems of political protest by the peasantry have been widely discussed by Shanin 1973 Alavi 1973 Cohen et al. eds 1979  The specific protests against soil conservation policies and other related issues such as the taking away of land for settlers plantations or the removal of forests have tended to follow the same pattern of violent politically primitive and usually short-lived protest involving marches on towns or centres of perceived political power of their oppressors and occasional guerrilla warfare e.g. the Mau Mau movement in Kenya although the issues involved were much wider than soil conservation 
Examples of peasant or pastoralist protest where official conservation policies were a catalytic or a leading grievance are Kenya Heyer et al.  1981 100 and the 1982 attempted coup Tanganyika Young and Fosbrooke 1960 Coulson 1981 56 Zambia Robinson 1978a 32 and the Chipko movement against commercial logging companies in the Indian Himalayas Albert 1979 Lean 1981 and for peasant struggles in general Cohen el al 
1979  In the vast majority of cases soil conservation measures were seen by land-users to be a symptom of oppression either by a colonial regime or by small interlocking urban elites 
From some of the evidence in Chapters 4.2 6.1 and 7.2 to 7.6 we may agree with them  Larger landholders may have equivocal and varied responses to official attempts at conservation 
On the one hand if erosion is seen to jeopardise the longer-term profitability of the farm government assistance in the form of agricultural extension grants for land management works advantageous pricing policies and subsidies are welcomed  On the other hand government interference is often resented and in liberal democracies the farm lobby is frequently quite powerful in the United States for example 
Well-organised farmers with economic and political resources are frequently instrumental in getting their governments to organise and even partly fund conservation services as in the predominantly German immigrant farmer community in Rio Grande de Sul of Brazil  In any concrete analysis there are four questions to be asked 
1  what precise groups and classes are affected adversely by soil erosion 
2  what power does each of them have in the state apparatus principally the legislature the army police certain key ministries and their line agencies down to the local level and outside it in the countryside Chambers of Commerce the shop-floor and so on 
3  in what ideological terms do these classes or groups perceive the problem of soil erosion causes blame solutions 
4  is the problem of soil erosion perceived to be important enough for them to unite on this issue so that their combined power leads to a coherent response 
what precise groups and classes are affected adversely by soil erosion  what power does each of them have in the state apparatus principally the legislature the army police certain key ministries and their line agencies down to the local level and outside it in the countryside Chambers of Commerce the shop-floor and so on 
in what ideological terms do these classes or groups perceive the problem of soil erosion causes blame solutions  is the problem of soil erosion perceived to be important enough for them to unite on this issue so that their combined power leads to a coherent response 
Two case studies will illustrate these ideas  It will be argued that the circumstances of Nepal and Zambia are not unusual in that a set of political preconditions for a successful soil conservation policy are not present and only exist in very rare circumstances the most outstanding examples being the Republic of South Africa and South Korea 
Usually the classes and groups most adversely affected by soil erosion are politically weak disunited and spatially separated  In the case of Nepal Blaikie 1983 the major impact of environmental degradation is felt by two groups 
The first are the poorer urban dwellers these are largely made up of junior office staff workers in the retail and hotel sectors petty retailers and petty commodity producers and the unemployed old and sick  Quite high proportions of their incomes are spent on fuelwood and prices have rocketed during the last ten years from Rs 20/- per load to Rs 50/-in Kathmandu from Rs 7/- in Pokhara in 1973 to Rs 20/- in 1983 
A shift to kerosene is very costly and nowadays fuel for cooking may absorb to up to 15â€“20 per cent of a poor household 's income see Schroeder 1977 Ives 1981  The second group are the farmers in the hills although there are considerable variations between regions and watersheds 
Farmers in the terai or plains are not really affected except by flooding although for physiographic reasons most of the flooding occurs to the south of the border with India  It is in the terai where large landlords often absent and in Kathmandu on other lucrative non-agricultural pursuits are well established rather than in the hills 
It would be reasonable to guess although without corroborative evidence that landslides gully and sheet erosion and a general decline in soil fertility would affect the livelihood of poorer and small farmers more critically than the strongly surplus farmer in all areas  The power that small hill farmers and poorer urban dwellers have in the state apparatus and in society at large is negligible 
The most powerful classes in Nepal include the rentier landlord both urban in Kathmandu involved in renting houses to shops aid personnel and in the hotel business and rural in the terai with large estates run on a share-cropping basis and/or with a relative or manager overseeing operations  Then there is the merchant class discreet and acting behind political figures whom they control with large inducements and dealing in the import of foreign luxuries and the export of rice both legally and illegally 
Finally there are the contractors who arrange labour and sometimes materials for the multifarious aid projects such as road construction buildings and hydroelectric plants  For each of these environmental deterioration is virtually irrelevant 
The ideological terms in which the affected groups perceive of the environmental crisis are not politically sophisticated in fact they have very little political content at all  The phenomenon of soil erosion tends to be understood in terms of a mixture of sound and quite sophisticated engineering principles which is implied in a classification of landslides and erosion and the supernatural 
The urban poor have many other issues alongside the escalating price of fuel particularly imported inflation manifested in high prices for cloth and imported household items high urban rents and low salaries at the bottom end of the public sector  Furthermore the causes of fuelwood scarcity must seem remote and diffuse to the average urban dweller 
It comes therefore as no surprise that these classes are disparate weak and ideologically unsophisticated in terms of facing the problem of soil erosion and deforestation  The impact of foreign aid upon environmental degradation is therefore doubly interesting and here the need to transcend a crude determinism of economic interests is necessary 
The ideological approach to the problem of soil erosion in the international aid and academic communities can not be read off or predetermined by the relative strength of direct economic interests as there is often a degree of autonomy of these ideas from economic determinants  After all the national interests of donors and the multilateral agencies they finance would be much better served by other projects than soil conservation which is a difficult diffuse and problematic area for foreign aid with goals that are very long term and difficult to achieve 
The interface therefore between aid personnel involved in the field of environmental conservation and government institutions in Nepal is interesting and one found in many countries elsewhere  On the one hand individuals usually on a short-term contract with a job to do face on the other hand a bureaucracy with mixed feelings about the importance of environmental deterioration 
The role of rhetoric becomes crucial here it serves to keep the flow of foreign funds from drying up and to disguise the endemic problems of implementation of these projects  The case of Zambia offers a contrast to that of Nepal 
The population of Zambia is less than half Nepal 's in a land area of more than ten times as large  In spite of low population pressure in an aggregate sense there has been considerable degradation and erosion in the clay-rich soils which are usually the most fertile and also in the north where rainfall intensities and runoff tend to be higher Robinson 1978b 15 
Erosion has also occurred as a result of overgrazing particularly in the Zambesi Valley the monoculture of maize and over smaller areas tobacco and of some European settler farmers who profitably exploited land in the Eastern Province during the tobacco boom but were not prepared to invest in long-term conservation measures  Yet in spite of a considerable erosion problem there exists no conservation service as such with only two ecologists at central level who are supposed to give adequate guidance for land use at the national level 
At the provincial level there are Land Use Planning Officers although their time is largely taken up by the supervision of settlement schemes and in planning state farms Stocking 1981b  The question arises as to why there is so little official action to combat soil erosion 
The present distribution of political power and the structure of the economy largely derive from Zambia 's Northern Rhodesia colonial history  Chapter 7.3 examines the colonial impact upon agriculture and this example confines itself to a very brief exploration of the colonial experience 
The area that is now Zambia attracted the attention of British colonisers because of its mineral wealth  Copper lead and zinc were mined in the centre and north of the country 
The economic structure of the countryside near the line-of-rail linking the mines with ports via South Africa was transformed to provide labour for the miners on temporary labour contracts in which the miner 's family would stay behind on the family farm  Also Africans were expelled from some of their lands to make way for European settlers who then farmed commercially to sell their produce to the mine workers and other urban dwellers 
The Zambian economy became extremely lop-sided in that it relied inordinately upon copper exports  Rural areas and subsistence-level farmers were neglected or actually excluded from the benefits which copper exports made possible in terms of schools health facilities agricultural inputs and credit Bwayla 1980 Klepper 1980 1981 ODG 1981 
Copper mining was responsible for 66 per cent of the country 's gross commercial product 60 per cent of government revenues and 95 per cent of export earnings Quick 1977 381  Since independence was regained in 1964 Zambia has become increasingly urbanised 
Indeed perhaps 50 per cent of the population now live in towns the highest level of urbanisation in Africa Simons 1981  The town represents overwhelmingly the focus of political power in Zambia today 
First well-developed mineworkers ' unions have been able to influence policy-makers particularly with regard to pursuing a cheap food policy  Second the political party which was instrumental in gaining independence and which has governed Zambia since the United National Independence Party or UNIP was and still is based mostly in towns particularly in Lusaka the national capital 
Third the bureaucratic bourgeoisie inflated in numbers and enjoying large incomes by African standards paid for by copper exports is in control of the state apparatus and decision-making see Szeftel 1980 for a more detailed and sophisticated analysis  In short 
The elite live mainly in cities and provincial capitals the seats of government headquarters of UNIP the ZCTU and mass media centres of financial institutions and the location of major mining industrial and commercial enterprises  These power centres attract people as honey attracts bees 
Operating from them decision-makers acquire urban habits and perspectives  Simons 1981 24

Operating from them decision-makers acquire urban habits and perspectives  Simons 1981 24 
All urban groups contrive in maintaining cheap food prices-as well as international capital and contractors who have interests in copper mining in Zambia in order to keep the pressure of union militancy for higher wages from squeezing profits  Therefore rural people have tended to have large surpluses extracted from them through low prices enforced by parastatal marketing boards 
Also miners ' families are not supported by the bachelors wages ' paid to the miner himself  Therefore family farms also cross-subsidise the profits from copper mining 
Commercial farmers increasingly Africans who have taken over in the wake of the slow European exodus since Independence are still relied upon to provide the bulk of the urban demand for foodstuffs particularly luxury items such as beef milk and cheese  Smaller family farmers have been neglected and offered derisory prices for the products they mostly sell e.g. cassava and honey see Chambers and Singer 1980 
Soil erosion would only affect these urban interests if it significantly threatened food supplies  Two important factors prevent this from happening 
First foreign earnings from copper have been used to purchase shortfalls in indigenous production  These shortfalls have increased in recent years due to cultivators avoiding cash crops altogether which attract poor prices bureaucratic and policy-making bungling and to a general neglect of the building up of physical and institutional infrastructure to aid farming 
Second there is as yet no land shortage and new land can still be taken into cultivation without much problem  The case of Operation Food Production launched in 1980 is such an example where enormous state farms have been set up to solve the food problem once and for all 
Therefore soil erosion is a problem faced by small farmers and pastoralists who are politically weak by large commercial farmers who can either move on or in the case of Europeans leave Zambia altogether  The financial support of the state apparatus and the spoils and patronage system that is a part of it lies in mining not in small farmer production 
For an introduction to the political economy of Zambia see Turok 1981  The first problem after adopting this approach is the size and scope of the analytical task 
From a more conventional approach which encompasses land use maps of soil erosion and the designation of technically feasible conservation measures which can be accepted within the constraints operating upon land-users a difficult enough task in itself an expansion is suggested to the present programme which seems to involve the political economy of the whole world in every instance of soil erosion  However I would suggest that the problem is more apparent than real 
Certainly it must be admitted that there are a number of relevant issues about development in general on which prior opinions have to be formed one of the most important is the relationship between rapid population growth and soil erosion which has been briefly discussed in Chapter 2  There are those concerning the nature of the state and the extent to which governments can conserve the environment 
Lastly there are those concerning the development of capitalism particularly whether it is beneficial for the mass of people living in lesser developed countries or whether it could or will become so  Admittedly then those seeking a comprehensive analysis will have to have some a priori position on these issues since they all profoundly affect or are affected by environmental degradation 
An isolated study of soil erosion and conservation by itself will not provide the answers to these broad controversies  However a bottom-up approach which always bears in mind the criterion of relevance to land-using decisions leading to environmental deterioration will leave many areas of local or national economic analysis aside 
A journalistic facility for finding and talking to knowledgeable people reading the right reports and informal commentaries plus a number of more academic and analytical papers should enable the researcher following the general methodology outlined here to explain soil erosion in a particular country  There is a second related problem that of the terms of reference of the concerned individual for effective action 
The question arises who is this analysis for and who does what about it  This is perhaps the most difficult one and brings up a number of fundamental contradictions 
The approach followed here is simply not a policy-orientated one although it may be helpful to that purpose incidentally  It is primarily an explanatory one it connects problems and explains why they are problems and who for and so does not set up bite-sized problems for the reformer to tackle one by one 
It is no coincidence that bureaucrats foreign aid consultants and ministry officials persist in seeing their role in this manner and trying to solve piecemeal separate problems  Indeed without other far-reaching changes in the way people make decisions this may be the only feasible strategy and this possibility is discussed in Chapter 9 
The conclusion reached there is that environmental degradation is and will be frequently beyond the power of the state and will only become a possibility as an incidental result of other fundamental social changes  In the light of this general conclusion which will be substantiated from Chapter 7 onwards it becomes clear that sharpening the tools of policy-making and increasing the expertness of government personnel should no longer be the central concern 
This in turn creates one of the most difficult problems of all a personal one which many government servants and agents or consultants must feel  It seems almost inconceivable that a project plan policy document or even a more abstract methodological contribution on conservation if well-organised and technically sound will not have a beneficial impact in the real world 
To fulfil the terms of reference for the task to work hard and to create a product that is innovative internally consistent and well-written gives satisfaction  It is very understandable for the person not to want to be aware that it probably will not fulfil its purpose 
To blame irrational politicians political constraints administrative incompetence or farmers ' traditional beliefs may ease the personal contradiction but it is analytically naive  Third there are epistemological and ideological problems associated with the bringing together of issues which have hitherto been studied in one or other of the natural or social sciences 
On the one hand as was mentioned at the outset of this chapter and in Chapter 2 the physical relationships which determine rates of soil erosion have been examined within natural science disciplines of hydrology agricultural engineering and agricultural botany  On the other hand the social relationships that determine how people use their environment have been studied in such disciplines as economics sociology and political science 
The point at issue is that both sets of disciplines tend to have different conceptions about the domain and status of proof in the pursuit of knowledge  Whether they should share a common epistemology is a debate which it is possible to avoid head-on in this context 
The view here is that while the activities of physical sciences too are amenable to a social explanation there are de facto different modes of explanation and substantiation  Some of these can be attributed to the subject matter for study itself the objects of study are so utterly different that they require fundamentally different methods and forms of explanation and understanding Benton 1977 12 
This is perhaps believed by practitioners rather than being a view that holds up to epistemological scrutiny  Members of academic research and other government institutions are divided into two separate scientific communities-the natural and social between which there is little effective cooperation and a lot of envy disdain and competition for scarce resources 
In the attempt to combine the analysis of physical processes of soil erosion with that of human agricultural and pastoral practices the expectations of natural and social scientists over the status and domain of proof tend to be irreconcilable for further discussion readers are referred to more detailed texts such as Winch 1958 Bernal 1969 Benton 1977 Gregory 1978  The main problem seems to derive from the positivist expectation that social explanation of soil erosion should be tested in the same way as most natural science ones 
While strenuous attempts to subject hypotheses to empirical evidence must be made the limits of proof must be recognised too  There are always a priori assumptions of what we call an ideological nature which are not amenable to proof but which may helpfully be amenable to explicit and prior communication 
The assumptions about the state and the world economic system which section 3 above discussed must lie outside and beyond an effort to prove by means of empirical verification  For example one can prove beyond a reasonable degree of doubt that a conservation project reduces the rate of soil removal 
One can not prove in the same way that senior bureaucrats do not implement effective conservation because there is no extra financial inducement and it could involve them in embarrassing political contradictions  As the foregoing critique of current soil conservation programmes shows there is a broad range of relevant issues about the nature of development itself 
Many of the reasons for widespread failure of conservation programmes and policies are the same as for failures in some other development programmes in lesser developed countries  An illustration is given of another important policy issue which has many political and economic similarities as well as the history of its thinking and policy formulation 
This is family planning and will be followed through with special reference to one of the world 's largest national programmes that of India  The evolution of the philosophy behind family planning during the last twenty years has moved rather quicker than that of soil conservation so that the present thinking and problems may indicate that in general terms this critique of conservation policy is not new but the transfer of ideas merely overdue 
Both family planning and soil conservation are activities which governments attempt to get people to undertake  Both are essentially private activities decided upon by persons within the household or in small groups and involve the deepest and most fundamental concerns in life 
Due partly to the propagation and acceptance of various theories of development e.g. Coale & Hoover 1958 and Ehrlich et al 1973 and perhaps to the direct pragmatic experience of government states have seen fit to try and persuade induce or coerce the people to undertake new patterns of reproduction or agricultural practice  One of the major problems with this is that the private benefits accruing to households or families who take up either family planning or conservation measures are often not clear either as perceived to exist by households themselves or even as calculated by economic models 
There is a considerable and divided literature about the private benefits accruing to a household with a small family Ohlin 1969 saying that children are not a good investment Caldwell 1978 and White 1976 suggesting a positive asset value for children  Much of the calculation depends upon the choice of discount rate which it might be added exists in the mind of the economist and rather foggily at that rather than in the minds of a couple about to sleep together 
In a similar way many economic models can not show a positive return to soil conservation measures except on very productive land with high susceptibility to erosion Harmon Knutson & Rosenberg 1979 Ervin & Washbourn 1981 for examples in the USA  In the case of the land-user implicit discount rates tend to be very high particularly for the disadvantaged 
Fuel for today and food for this season are vital concerns now and for such people Keynes ' aphorism that in the long run we are all dead may be appropriate  In the case of the couple or family considering the costs and benefits of a future child the explicit consideration of rates of discount is rather different in that children are perceived to be a positive asset from early on in life but particularly after fifteen years or so when they can work effectively on the farm and so replace costly paid labour at times of peak labour demand or as a wage labourer 
There is in many societies a strong economic political and psychic advantage in having male children so the proposition of preventing any births precludes that possibility and those benefits are perceived to be real as soon as the male child is born  In both cases too those private choices in some cases bring about the tragedy of the commons Hardin 1972 
Private benefits from more children in the same way as adding an extra livestock unit to the communal pasture are positive but the public benefits may be negative  Each extra livestock unit added means less pasture available per unit to the detriment of the whole herd 
Within a given political economy where there is a free market for labour taking this hypothetically as given labour becomes so plentiful and therefore cheap that it can not make a living  Second there is a different sense in which private individuals may not want to conserve soil or have a small family other than the most obvious that it may not benefit them 
Many societies have been conserving the environment perfectly well for millennia and have integrated conservation into cultivation practices but not as an explicit programme  Similarly children have been spaced or limited when required by a variety of means e.g. abstinence after the birth of a child or delaying the age for cohabitation 
Family planning practice as made possible by an operation such as vasectomy or tubeligation or the use of physical contraceptives makes the prevention of birth explicit and deliberate  Even where religious textual condemnation does not exist as in some societies there is a strong cross-cultural feeling that such acts are against nature or God 
In other words although people have been conserving soil or limiting children for a long time an explicit and out-of-context definition of a single element in people 's lives conservation small families will tend to be distrusted and misunderstood  Third technical problems of conservation and contraception have frequently caused suffering among their unfortunate adopters 
Examples of technical failures of mechanical means of soil conservation have already been given in Chapter 5  In the case of family planning the inter-uterine contraceptive device IUCD was launched in India in the mid-1960s before adequate research showed that many women were physically unsuited to it and it needed a high level of professional judgement on the part of the paramedical staff inserting it 
Oral contraceptives too have had long-term effects upon the health of users  Many cases of infections after vasectomy operations have been reported in India Blaikie 1972 1975 
In both cases inadequate research led to inadequate technical measures being launched and has in places where the worst effects were felt put both programmes back decades  Apart from the reasons why people resist or avoid government-sponsored conservation planning because of the lack of clear perceived private benefits there is a second similarity between the two programmes 
The issues awakened by these programmes lie deep in the political economy  A falling birth-rate is brought about by a large number of changes in society 
An inadequate list may include reduction in infant and child mortality better employment prospects for educated children making investment in education worthwhile and therefore a cost related to the number of children women 's status in the household and extent of emancipation in making decisions education of parents and enrolment rates in education for children and women 's participation in the formal labour force where pregnancy implies unavoidable loss of earnings  To alter these variables and to a sufficient degree and in sufficient combinations requires a wholesale change in the fabric of society 
In the same way soil conservation involves an almost equally wide range of social and economic changes  However in both cases piecemeal changes with a coherent programme can also have a definite effect 
Programme effects can sometimes be isolated statistically and in the case of family planning have not been insignificant  However in both cases successful programmes have only occurred when other deep-seated conditions in society have been present which are favourable to reductions in the birth-rate or to effective soil conservation 
For policy-makers the problems of research and measurement of a large number of important variables often of a non-quantitative kind have been severe both in population studies and in soil conservation  Perhaps it might be claimed that the major important variables in measuring population growth rates and their causes are technically easier than those measuring soil erosion rates and their causes 
However as experience in family planning programmes throughout the world has shown a lack of academic knowledge was not the major problem in achieving their modest attainments but the inability of governments to shift the major socio-economic variables which encourage the continuation of large families  Some progress was made upon a few particularly the reduction of major epidemics of malaria cholera smallpox and yellow-fever 
Others such as the improvement in the status of women or educational followed by enhanced employment opportunities for children particularly to disadvantaged and poor sections are much more difficult to achieve Cassen 1980  So it is with conservation policies 
More research is not a call made usually by conservationists quite the opposite in fact MAB 1979 Holdgate 1982 with the exception of a number of specific technical issues  It has been a lack of progress on other fundamental changes in society that has made effective implementation of either programme so difficult 
In the case of conservation an effective family planning programme and alternative employment for landless and small farmers outside agriculture reduces pressure on agricultural land pasture and forest  A more remunerative price structure for agricultural products and other measures to raise incomes for the poorest may encourage the use of purchased alternative fuels other than wood or cowdung 
It may also help the farmer to bear the immediate costs of conservation measures and an effective decision-making structure to secure the active cooperation of land-users themselves  Lastly both programmes have almost universally been politically unpopular in the countries where they have been launched 
Not a single political party in India up to the Emergency of 1975 supported the family planning programme publicly  Likewise many East and Central African leaders avoid conservation policies since these reminded the people of the coercive colonial policies imposed by the British 
In both cases the ideas of a very influential but small number of people in the United States individuals as well as institutions backed by large foreign aid funds and a wealth of expertise particularly in soil conservation were responsible for the presence of both family planning and conservation programmes in many lesser developed countries  In an historical analysis of the growth of neo-Malthusianism in US foreign policy the importance of a high-ranking State Department official one Philander Claxton Jr was vital 
He was able to ensure that the strong anti-natalist movement penetrated the highest offices of state and was responsible for enormous sums being spent in US foreign aid thereafter Simon 1981 Warwick 1982  Thus political leaders of lesser developed countries found themselves part of a government that had officially accepted a family planning programme or soil conservation programme or both but were aware that there was widespread opposition locally to both 
Thus there are four major areas in which family planning and soil conservation policies are similar the attempt on the part of the state to change private action where private benefits are not clear the deep-seated nature of the key or determining variables in the achievement of the policies ' objectives the problems of researching a highly complex field and the realisation that knowledge of how the key variables operate is not enough and the fact that these policies are almost universally unpopular with politicians and people in general  It is not surprising therefore that the history of thought about the two policy areas is in some ways similar although that of family planning is in many ways a decade ahead of conservation 
To return to the case of the family planning programme in India the 1961 national census provided some very sombre projections of available food supply per caput  The ideology of family planning for the lesser developed countries plus the formidable apparatus to diffuse it to world leaders was ready and was translated into American and later multilateral aid for India to set up a nationwide family planning service 
The clinical approach to family planning in which medical staff advised upon and provided services at the hospital was replaced by an extension approach in which a vast array of extension agents and network of services in the countryside was set up using many techniques of marketing and advertising adapted to the Indian context  A policy objective was identified to reduce the crude birth rate in ten years substantially in order to spread the small family norm 
Extension services were set up to focus upon a target population of every couple the wife of which was aged 15â€“44 years backed up by medical services and financial incentives to adopters  In this way the private benefits of the small family norm it was hoped would be adopted 
There were many problems predictably and acceptance was very uneven concentrated in cities the more prosperous rural areas and in literate middle-class couples Blaikie 1972 1975 IBRD 1977a  There were murmurs too that other constraints to a small family norm had been grossly neglected particularly the only slowly falling rate of infant and child mortality in many backward areas 
Also the notion that only households with very specific demographic characteristics and specific patterns of access to land find it in their interests to have fewer children gained some publicity Mamdani 1976  It was not until the UN Conference on Population in Bucharest in 1973 that a more radical critique of family planning programmes was launched and widely discussed at international level 
Also in India there appeared a number of radical critiques of its own programme which both contributed to and benefited from the conference on population at Bucharest e.g. Weissman 1970  Here an attack was launched on neo-Malthusianism which was considered by its critics to be politically conservative and which it was claimed shifted the burden of blame for underdevelopment to those with the largest families 
Rapid population growth was argued to be a result of poverty rather than a cause and causes were identified elsewhere in the relationship between developed capitalist and underdeveloped countries  The perception of high infant mortality itself was a symptom of poverty and this fuelled a continued desire to have a large family as an insurance against the death of existing children 
Landlessness was also seen as an element of poverty and encouraged large families so that children could earn and remit wages  Mamdani 1976 has put forward analyses which attempt to show that it is in the economic interests of many rural couples not to adopt family planning 
In short rapid population growth was a result of poverty and this asked fundamental questions about access and control over the means of production as well as the technical means by which they were developed  Neo-Malthusianism was further attacked in ways already discussed in Chapter 2 but also drew what in the authors ' opinion was a misplaced and utopian analysis from the Marxist literature based solely on a critique of bourgeois ideology without serious attention being given to the effects of rapid population growth in any social formation transitional to socialism or towards any other social order 
See also Cassen 1976 for a call for more convincing radical population studies  The genesis of political consciousness towards conservation programmes arose in very different circumstances but its development has been moving in the same directions as family planning programmes 
Conservation programmes arose both within the United States and more or less independently in the colonies of sub-Saharan Africa  As Chapters 3 and 4 have indicated a coercive conservation policy for African cultivators existed alongside a voluntary and financially supported one for white commercial farmers 
The enforced high population densities endured by Africans due to the expropriation of land for white commercial farmers threatened to make existing agricultural and pastoral practices very harmful to the long-term productivity of land  The conservation measures put forward by the British and Belgian colonial authorities were highly demanding of labour and moreover symbolised the logic of expropriation and more general exploitation by the colonial powers 
While freedom movements in central and eastern Africa were stimulated by these coercive policies an effective means of ideological diffusion did not lie in the hands of African cultivators nor their leaders and therefore the analytical lessons to be drawn did not find their way into the international conventional wisdom about conservation  However there is here an instructive similarity between the two policy areas in question 
Both identified a single problem and devised policy solutions without an acknowledgement of the possibility of political change and the removal of the root causes of the problem  Had this acknowledgement been made both a high birth-rate and environmental degradation would appear symptoms of a wider malaise 
There were two further developments of the family planning programme of India after Bucharest which are relevant to conservation programmes of today  The first was an accelerated attempt to broaden the focus of the family planning programme to include the broader concept of family welfare planning an ingenious verbal massage of an increasingly tarnished image but one which did acknowledge the need for a better delivery system for family health including better preventative medicine pre- and post-puerperal care and advice on household hygiene which would lower infant mortality rates and improve the health of the family 
Other measures were unfortunately not undertaken seriously unlike better health provision they impinged directly upon the political and economic interests of dominant classes or groups  Adult literacy campaigns particularly for women rural employment generation and land reform or land redistribution which all might have helped to provide a decision-making environment for a small family as well as other benefits for their own sake remained at the stage of inaugural addresses or insignificant pilot projects 
A true population programme in the broadest sense failed to emerge  Conservation thinking has begun to grasp a few of the same nettles 
It is now commonplace to read of the importance of local participation the problem of unequal landholdings the direct and indirect effects of large-scale commercial farming in the tropics and powerful and vested interests see Ch. 5  A few notable articles discussed in the following chapters have taken this further and laid out the implications of successful conservation 
The second development in family planning in India was of a very different kind and involved the attempt by the state during the Emergency of 1975/76 to step up the programme  It appeared as a leading policy under Sanjay Gandhi 's Four Point later Five Point Programme following the first official policy document National Population Policy a statement by the Government of India 16 April 1976 
A highly coercive and administratively effective set of measures were instituted and carried out  In the case of the state of Maharashtra a compulsory sterilisation bill outlining heavy prison sentences for non-sterilisation in certain cases actually reached the State Assembly Economic and Political Weekly 10 April 1976 p.550 
Political will backed by force as it had to be in the view of the highly ambivalent public reaction to the programme hitherto had come with a vengeance Gwatkin 1979 29  During the year 1976 the highest level of enthusiasm for family planning endured more than 8 million sterilisations were reported more than three times the number in the preceding year these meant a nearly 50% increase in the proportion of Indian couples estimated to be protected by modern contraception achieved within a matter of months 
But also by the time the programme drive came to an end when the Emergency ended and with it the effective coercive powers of than government millions had suffered harassment at the hands of government officials bent on implementing it many perhaps hundreds had died from it the political leaders who had willed it were out of power and in disrepute and the programme itself was in total disarray  See also Banerji 1977 Economic and Political Weekly Editorial 27 March 1976 and with reference to the backlash effect Bose 1978

See also Banerji 1977 Economic and Political Weekly Editorial 27 March 1976 and with reference to the backlash effect Bose 1978  What is also clear is that it was the weaker and poorer sections of the public that were harassed most 
Ironically it is they who have a birth-rate which is falling less quickly thus justifying that harassment  This is a direct parallel with conservation programmes that concentrate on small peasant farmers and those marginal semi-proletariat which find themselves eking out a living charcoal-burning cultivating the steepest slopes or in shifting cultivation without sufficient fallow-periods an issue which is explored in detail in Chapter 7 
In the case of the conservation policy of India similar failures to that of the family planning programme have already been noted in Chapter 3  The private benefits to conservation have been extremely ill-distributed which reflects the underlying dominance of certain classes and groups in Indian government the industrialists the capitalist farmers and senior bureaucrats 
Between 1951 and 1980 the total area brought under afforestation schemes was 3.18m ha and 2.2m ha nearly 70% were plantations for industrial purposes  The beneficiaries are overwhelmingly large landlords and industrial capital 
The beneficiaries are not small farmers except in a few isolated cases where costs and benefits are seen to be equally shared e.g. in Sukhomaj Village which is discussed in the CSE report p. 14  Second the cause of the problem has been clearly identified as nomads and graziers who are politically very weak and who have had much of their livelihood taken away and upon whom the heaviest penalties for trespassing on forest schemes fall in the same way as in the days of the Emergency when aggressive family planning drives herded vagrants petty thieves and other vulnerable groups into camps for more or less forcible vasectomy 
The dÃ©bÃ¢cle for the Indian family planning programme tells us something already clear from conservation programmes under colonial administration  Coercion is possible when there is a government willing to use state power but it also fails not solely because coercion as a means to an end tends to fail but because both programmes in order to achieve any impact involved very large numbers of people even the majority which implies serious problems for the logistics of coercion and of mass political backlash 
States that are exploring a tough policy which borders upon coercion like Kenya will either find that open political protest will challenge the power of the state or that like family planning in India an onslaught upon the least economically and politically powerful is only temporarily feasible  More passive forms of resistance such as stealing wire and fence posts which exclude people from afforestation projects ring-barking plantations setting protected pastures alight collecting firewood by night and so on are resorted to and are almost beyond the power of enforcement agencies to stop 
Those who advocate tough policies particularly those who do not seriously question the broad political economic context in which they might be implemented such as Hardin 1977 Hardin & Baden 1977 underestimate these difficulties and some obvious lessons from history  In summary family planning programmes in lesser developed countries since the 1960s have a good deal of light to throw upon soil conservation programmes 
Acknowledgement of the failure of targeting upon soil erosion as being the problem is long overdue  A full analysis of the causes of soil erosion is required 
If a mixed metaphor can be forgiven Pandora 's box remains black and must now be opened to the light of day  chapter 1 
Chapter 2  Chapter 3 
Chapter 4  Chapter 5 
If mountains can have personalities then volcanoes are schizophrenic they have split personalities  For most of their life they are dormant and one tends to think of them as graceful upsweeping cones delicately capped with snow dreaming serenely over the cherry-blossom-draped landscapes of calendars and travel posters 
Sometimes perhaps not very often during their lifetimes volcanoes erupt and present a wholly different character  Convolute eruption clouds tower above them raining hot ashes on the helpless humans who live on their flanks and glowing tongues of liquid rock ooze inexorably downwards engulfing the flimsy structures which stand in their way 
Not surprisingly it is for these displays of nature 's most powerful forces at work that volcanoes are chiefly known and in almost all primitive societies they have been regarded with fear and identified with deities and evil spirits  Although today volcanoes are no longer regarded with such religious awe their violent aspects are still widely publicized deservedly since volcanic eruptions are amongst the finest of natural spectacles 
There are thousands of metres of film of eruptions and hectares of accounts in newspapers and books almost all of it devoted to the human interest situations that arise whenever natural events interrupt the pattern of human life  Some eruptions have become major historical events since many of the world 's greatest natural disasters have been associated with volcanoes either directly through the effects of explosions and suffocation by volcanic gases or indirectly through the much further-reaching effects of tidal waves triggered off by an eruption such as those resulting from the great eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 
This book will of course deal with the familiar aspects of volcanoes and with the different kinds of eruptions that take place but in addition to this it will cover some of the quieter less well-known aspects and try to explain why volcanoes exist at all why they occur where they do and how they fit into the history of the Earth as a whole  To do this will involve discussion of concepts which you may not immediately associate with volcanoes the fact that Africa and South America were once joined and later drifted apart that the direction which is customarily thought of as north would a few million years ago have appeared to be south on an ordinary magnetic compass 
There is the fact that the very rocks on which we live no matter where may have originated through volcanism that much of the gold and many of the other economic minerals that we use every day are linked with volcanic activity that most of the world 's best coffee and tea come from volcanic areas and that there may be areas on the Moon and Mars which are analogous to terrestrial continents and oceans  Before embarking on these widely different topics however it is essential to consider volcanoes in their global setting 
The World Distribution of Volcanoes  Volcanoes are not scattered randomly around the world 
If you were asked to name countries in which volcanoes occur you would probably think of places such as Japan Iceland Hawaii Italy New Zealand and so on  At first these areas may seem quite unrelated but no matter what countries you think of the volcanoes in them have one rather odd thing in common they are all very near the sea 
This is n't such an irrelevant statement as it may sound it is a fact that almost all the volcanoes in the world are within a couple of hundred kilometres of the sea  There are remarkably few active volcanoes in the centres of continents none at all in South or North America away from the Andean-Rockies mountain belt none in central Asia none in Australia and only one away from the coast in Antarctica 
There are some important exceptions in Africa and also some recently-dead volcanoes in France and Germany but these form a rather specialized distinct group and we 'll see how they fit in later on  Given then that volcanoes have a predilection for the seaside let's now pin down more precisely where they occur 
If one plots the sites of all the recently-active volcanoes in the world on a map one finds that several distinct narrow chains exist some of these running along the edges of continental land masses some along island arcs and some of them through the sea see Fig. 1  We 'll follow two of these chains in a sort of volcanic Cook 's tour since they are of fundamental importance to our story and will crop up repeatedly throughout the rest of the text 
Before commencing it should be emphasized that when a geologist talks of a volcano having been recently active he means that it has been active within the last ten thousand years  That may seem anything but recent but remember that a million years is a relatively insignificant span of time compared with the age of the Earth at present reckoned at about 4,600 million years 
An active volcano is usually regarded as one which has erupted at least once in historic times  Continental Margin Volcanoes 
The first chain starts off right down in the Antarctic a few hundred kilometres from the South Pole  Here in the lonely isolation of the Antarctic ice cap is Mt Early the world 's southern-most volcano 
Further to the north along the ice-bound coast of Marie Byrd Land are more volcanoes and a well-defined belt soon becomes established swinging away into the long crooked arm of the Graham Land peninsula and then eastwards into a scatter of desolate little-known volcanic islands the South Sandwich Islands  This line of islands swings round to the north and finally back to the west through South Georgia describing a great loop and then heads off for the extreme south of South America 
Here in the tangle of islands and fjords that is Patagonia the volcanic chain becomes established on the South American continent with Mt Burney an obscure almost unknown volcano which has only once been visited by a geologist in 1911  From Mt Burney northwards volcanoes occur intermittently along almost the entire 7,000-kilometre length of the Andes 
In all there are thousands of extinct or dormant volcanoes but only forty-five are considered to be active  Right in the northern part of South America in Colombia the volcanic chain and the Andean mountain chain get a bit mixed up 
The mountains swing away to the east running into Venezuela but the volcanic chain after a short gap in the dreary and fever-ridden jungles of the Isthmus of Panama reappears in full vigour in Costa Rica and extends throughout the Central American republics of Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala which are by reputation as unstable and explosive politically as the many volcanoes that they contain  The Caribbean islands present a slight complication to this simple picture of a single volcanic chain running up the Americas 
They form another chain looping up from the coast of Venezuela through Jamaica and Cuba heading towards the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico  The West Indian islands contain less than a dozen active volcanoes all of them congregated in a small arc at the east of the chain but one of these Mt Pelee was responsible for the most lethal eruption of this century 
Mexico contains many active volcanoes a quantity of them burdened with tortuous Aztec names such as the well-known Popocatepetl  Moving further north the United States has rather fewer volcanoes and although there are some impressive cones such as those of Mt Shasta and Mt Rainier both over 4,000 metres high there have been only a few minor eruptions in historic times 
Further north still Canada has no major volcanoes but there have been some eruptions in prehistoric times  In the south west of Alaska the volcanic chain picks up again strongly and swings out to sea to form the long arcs of the Aleutian and Kurile Islands 
These curve back up northwards towards the Kamchatka peninsula of the U.S.S.R. an intensely active volcanic province and then the chain sweeps down southwards heading for Japan  From Japan the chain goes on through the island of Taiwan Nationalist China through the Philippines and into the Celebes 
Here there is a kind of volcanic T junction  One branch runs north-westwards up into the Indonesian archipelago where volcanoes have killed more people than anywhere else on earth and peters out before reaching the Asian mainland 
The other branch runs south-eastwards through New Guinea and the New Hebrides and through a scatter of small Melanesian islands before making an abrupt dog 's leg northwards to the Samoan islands to join the Tonga-Kermadec chain which extends southwards again into New Zealand  Sadly there are no volcanoes on the South Island of New Zealand and the volcanic chain we have been following all round the pacific seems to fizzle out there 
The only volcanoes further south are in Antarctica over 1,500 kilometres away  These include Buckle Island just off the Antarctic coast and Mts Erebus and Terror only a few kilometres from Scott 's original base camp from which he set out on his last heroic journey 
One should n't strictly include Erebus and Terror in the same chain as those of New Zealand the gap is rather large but they do bring us conveniently back to Antarctica from where we began our journey of some 40,000 kilometres round the entire Pacific Ocean  The chain of volcanoes which girdles the Pacific is known appropriately enough as the Ring of Fire and although it 's a much more complex disjointed affair than it may seem from this brief summary it is unquestionably one of the Earth 's greatest physical features and contains a large proportion of all the world 's volcanoes 
And not one of them is more than 300 kilometres from the sea  Mid-ocean Volcanoes see Fig. 2 
Our second tour begins nearly at the opposite pole with Jan Mayen a small ice-gripped island in the Arctic Ocean roughly half-way between Greenland and Arctic Norway  On this bleak island is a volcano Beerenberg which last erupted in 1970 
South-west of Jan Mayen is Iceland built entirely of volcanic rocks and famous for both its volcanoes and its geysers  The Icelanders called one of their finest gushers of boiling water and steam Geysir and this name was applied subsequently to all those depressing pieces of gas-fired plumbing which used to be a familiar part of the British bathroom scene 
Iceland has twenty-two volcanoes but the ones which have been most in the news are located on the Westmann Islands just off the south coast  A new island Surtsey was built up by an eruption which started in 1963 and continued intermittently until 1967 
In February 1973 an eruption suddenly burst out on the tiny island of Heimaey and for a time it seemed as though the town of Heimaey Iceland 's biggest fishing port would be destroyed  Fortunately though the eruption petered out in July 1973 before irrevocable damage had been done 
South of Iceland the Atlantic Ocean stretches out devoid of even the tiniest of islands for thousands of kilometres  In 1884 sightings of a submarine eruption were reported by the officers of ships right in the middle of the ocean half-way between Ireland and Newfoundland 
This may have been an eruption similar to that which built Surtsey but it came to nothing and no island succeeded in raising its head above water  Just about level with the Straits of Gibraltar and 1,300 kilometres from the Portuguese coast are the Azores a small group of islands which are entirely built of volcanic rocks where eruptions took place in 1957 and 1973 
South of the Azores but only about 100 to 150 kilometres from the African coast are the Canary Islands also volcanic and also the scene of recent eruptions  South and west of the Canaries the Atlantic extends emptily for thousands of kilometres broken only by the Cape Verde Islands also volcanic and two tiny specks of land St Peter and St Paul 's Rocks which are not strictly volcanic oddly enough but are composed of material that must have been derived from much deeper levels in the Earth than most volcanic rocks 
South of this tiny pair are a few lonely islands separated from one another by hundreds of kilometres of sea first Ascension Island then St Helena and then over towards the Brazilian coast Trinidade  Further south still is Tristan da Cunha notorious for its eruption in 1962 which precipitated the evacuation of the unfortunate islanders to Britain 
Tristan has two near neighbours both uninhabited Nightingale and Inaccessible and a third a couple of hundred kilometres further south Gough Island all of them are the battered remains of extinct volcanoes  Further south still the Roaring Forties begin those empty expanses of the Southern Ocean which stretch right around the world at this latitude 
The last link in our tenuous volcanic chain lies even further south south of latitude 50 degrees Bouvet Island desolate inaccessible and almost entirely icebound  Little is known of eruptions there but there may have been one in the last decade since sets of aerial photographs of the island taken many years apart show some slight changes 
Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics  Part 1 Continental Drift 
In the days before modern oceanography the story would stop short at this point with just a long tenuous chain of widely-separated volcanic islands running down the middle of the Atlantic with no obvious connection between them  The link however was discovered soon after systematic depth soundings were taken when it was discovered that there was a long submarine mountain range running down the middle of the Atlantic from Arctic to Antarctic 
This range although covered by many hundreds of metres of water for most of its length breaks surface in a few places to form the chain of apparently unconnected volcanic islands  But not all some like the Canaries although related to the ridge lie well to one side of it 
More important the range almost exactly bisects the Atlantic Ocean from north to south following closely the profile of the African and South American coasts so it 's always called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge  Specimens recovered from the sea floor showed that this ridge consists entirely of volcanic rocks and similar ridges were soon found to be present beneath many of the oceans 
Not all of them are strictly mid-ocean some of them run right up to the continents but together they form a world-wide network of mountain belts far higher above ocean floor level and more extensive than any on dry land  The Mid-Atlantic Ridge will play an important part in our study of the nature of volcanism and so will another the East Pacific Rise which runs up the eastern Pacific and eventually intersects the North American continent in the vicinity of California 
After Francis Bacon first drew attention to it in 1620 there was endless speculation on the reason for the striking similarity in shape between the coastlines of Africa and South America  Cardboard cut-outs of the two continents were made and fitted together computer programmes written to devise the most perfect match between the two continents similarities and the differences in the geology of corresponding areas studied ad nauseam and even details of the animal life in each continent compared but without reaching any firm conclusions on whether or not the two continents had ever been united 
The remarkably faithful matching of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the shapes of the continents was a great boost to the theory of continental drift which postulated that Africa and South America had originally formed a supercontinent which subsequently split up with the two parts moving away in opposite directions  But even the presence of the ridge proved nothing it merely made the problem at once more difficult and more fascinating and debate over the possibility of continental drift raged fiercely with geologists divided into two opposing camps 
So long as no viable cause for continental drift could be demonstrated however belief in it remained an act of faith  The elegant solution to the uniquely challenging problem of finding a cause was first suggested in 1929 by Arthur Holmes one of the greatest of British geologists but it was not until 1960 that the late Professor Harry Hess of Princeton University in the U.S.A. developed Holmes 's idea into a convincing hypothesis 
Although he did not know it at the time Hess 's work was to initiate a revolution in geological and geophysical thinking and ultimately it became the foundation of a major new theory about how continents and oceans are related and what part volcanoes play in the evolution of the Earth  This new approach to world geology is generally known as the Plate Tectonic Theory or just Plate Tectonics 
Although geology is a fairly elderly discipline as sciences go in its 150-year history there have been no sudden breakthroughs of the sort beloved of journalists  It has advanced slowly by the patient amassing and interpretation of data in many varied fields ranging from the study of fossils palaeontology to the chemical and physical properties of rocks themselves petrology 
Plate Tectonics however was truly a great leap forward since it helps to explain the interrelationships of almost all geological phenomena  As such it must rank as one of the most fundamental scientific advances of the century 
Apart from its intrinsic interest Plate Tectonics is also an excellent example of how many major scientific advances are made the starting point is a bright idea in the mind of some unusually-gifted scientist an intuitive feeling probably based on thoroughly shaky evidence rather than some great intellectual tour de force  The first idea is refined into a hypothesis by collecting more evidence to see if it really works and ultimately it may be elevated into the rather grand status of a Theory if successful predictions can be based upon it 
Any theory must be useful it must be able to explain how or why things happen  If in the course of its development observations are made to test the theory and the theory fails to explain some of them then it has to be refined to take account of the new observations 
Before considering the Plate Tectonic Theory and its evolution however a short background description of the overall structure of the Earth is necessary  Our planet has three main parts an inner core which is believed to consist of a mass of iron and nickel a mantle composed of dense dark silicate rock rich in iron and magnesium known as peridotite and a very thin crust see Fig. 1 
Since we live on the crust it is important to us in more ways than one but we are only going to consider it in its relationship to events in the mantle since these explain how Plate Tectonics works  The crust can be divided into two types oceanic and continental 
The continental crust taken as a whole consists of rocks fairly light both in colour and density which contain a lot of silica silicon dioxide  Silicon and oxygen are by far the most abundant constituents in the Earth 's crust 
Broadly speaking the rocks of the continental crust have the composition of granite the rather coarse-grained pink- or grey-speckled rock beloved of the more respectable banks and monumental masons  This should not be taken too literally not every rock in the crust is a granite things like limestones are vastly different in composition but the average composition of all the rocks on the continents is about that of granite and contains over 60 per cent of silica 
In most areas the continental crust consists of a thirty-kilometre thick slab of such rocks but under high mountain ranges it is fifty or more kilometres thick  Continental crust is also present beneath most of the shallow seas of the world such as the 200-metre-deep North Sea which is in geological terms just a temporarily flooded bit of the European continent 
The oceanic crust which forms the floor of all the deep oceans of the world is much thinner only about eight to ten kilometres thick but since the oceans cover a much greater proportion of the Earth 's surface than the continents the proportion is roughly three to one they are quantitatively just as significant  The rocks of the oceanic crust are different in many respects from the average rocks of the continents they are black dense rocks usually very fine-grained contain much less silica less than 50 per cent and are remarkably uniform even monotonous in appearance 
These are the archetypal volcanic rocks called basalts  Both the oceanic and the continental crust are separated from the underlying mantle by a sort of boundary or discontinuity known after its Yugoslavian discoverer as the Mohorovicic discontinuity or Moho for short 
This discontinuity was recognized by studying the behaviour of shock-waves from earthquakes above the Moho shock waves travel relatively slowly below it in the denser rocks of the mantle they travel much faster  Now what happens in the mantle is extremely important because it is in the mantle that we have to look for the mechanism behind Plate Tectonics 
The rocks of the mantle are rather curious in one respect they appear to have the properties of both liquids and solids  Where geologically instantaneous events such as earthquakes are concerned they are rigid enough to transmit the shock waves like any solid 
But on a much longer time-scale involving thousands of years they behave differently and can flow like a highly-viscous liquid millions of times more viscous than even the stickiest treacle  In this respect the mantle rocks resemble pitch or brittle toffee which will shatter at a sudden blow but will bend easily if flexed slowly and continuously 
Pitch of course gets progressively softer as it is heated and similarly since the rocks of the mantle are also at high temperatures the temperature in the earth increases downwards at a rate of about 30 degrees C per kilometre they can also be thought of as being rather soft  Accepting then that the material making up the mantle can behave as a viscous liquid this raises an interesting possibility 
If a body of liquid is at the same temperature throughout it will remain still unless someone comes along and stirs it up  But if the lower parts of the liquid are hotter than the upper parts then it will be anything but still 
The hottest parts of a liquid are also the least dense or lightest and so they tend to rise upwards to float above the denser cooler liquid  As the liquid ascends though it cools down and thus gets denser so that it must sink again 
A continuous cycle soon gets established with hot liquid rising and cold descending see Fig. 2 the effect can be seen in any hot liquid that has particles in it even tea or coffee made with instant milk  The process is known as convection and it is widely but not universally believed to work on a huge scale in the mantle 
In a cup of tea the particles whizz round at a great rate in the mantle the flow is so slow that it would be barely perceptible over the course of a human lifetime  It was Arthur Holmes who first suggested that mantle convection currents might be responsible for continental movements but he lacked any direct geophysical data that might have supported his views 
An upwelling current of hot liquid be it tea or mantle carries a lot of heat with it and this factor provided one of the starting points for the new Plate Tectonic ideas  It was found that the heatflow or rate at which heat is moving upwards through the Earth 's crust is several times higher along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge than on the ocean floor on either side 
This is where Hess started in his attempt to explain the nature of global processes  He suggested that beneath the volcanic Mid-Atlantic Ridge there was an upwelling convective current of hot partly-liquid rock in the mantle and that as this column approached the surface it would split turning away from the ridge in two branches 
Both branches would move steadily outwards to form the oceanic crust which as it got progressively further away from the ridge would rapidly acquire a thin veneer of deep sea sediments muds and clays mixed up with myriads of tiny shells from planktonic organisms  Hess mistakenly thought that the oceanic crust consisted of altered peridotite the material of the mantle itself 
It is now known however that it is made up of basaltic rocks derived indirectly from peridotite and erupted by volcanic action along the ridge itself building up the long submarine mountain range and giving rise to the relatively few volcanoes which poke their heads above sea level  Hess 's outstanding contribution was the suggestion that new oceanic crust is actually generated at a mid-ocean ridge and spreads out laterally away from it 
This suggestion which was made in 1960 is at the root of all that follows we can label it the sea-floor spreading hypothesis see Fig. 3  Right from the beginning it had some obvious implications 
Hess thought that the spreading rate at the ocean ridge was of the order of one centimetre per year  If this were true and if oceanic crust was being generated at all the oceanic ridges in the world at this rate throughout geological history then the entire present oceanic crust could have been formed in a mere couple of hundred million years and therefore without some other kind of process acting there would be a vast quantity of spare oceanic crust lying around 
Remember that the age of the Earth is 4,600 million years  It was obvious that oceanic crust must be continually destroyed somewhere at a rate comparable with that of its creation at the oceanic ridges in order to maintain a balance 
Hess suggested that this took place along the deep ocean trenches such as the Chile-Peru Trench which runs parallel to the west coast of South America and that the relatively cold oceanic crust dived down beneath the continents in these zones descending deep into the mantle to complete the convective cycle  Continental drift could therefore be easily explained by Hess 's hypothesis since the rocks of the mantle under the continents are identical to and continuous with the rocks of the mantle underlying the thin oceanic crust 
The continents just drift around passively on the backs of the mantle convection cells like great rafts with the leading edges of the rafts being dragged down and thickened where they encounter descending oceanic crust  The thickened edges of these rafts are of course the mountain chains such as the Andes 
A great deal of evidence from many different fields of research was required to turn Hess 's sea-floor spreading idea into a theory  Strangely enough the most critical discovery had already been made before Hess published his idea but it was left to two other geologists F.J. Vine and D.H 
Matthews to demonstrate three years later how this pre-existing evidence supported the new hypothesis  The evidence was of the way in which the rocks of the oceanic crust are magnetized it 's not the kind of thing that one comes across every day so it will take a bit of explaining 
Rocks may not seem initially to be particularly magnetic  They are n't on the whole though some will affect the needle of a compass brought up near to them 
All rocks however and especially basaltic rocks which contain a lot of iron minerals are weakly magnetized and this magnetism can be detected by sensitive instruments  The magnetism is built into the basalt when it is first formed and it records the nature of the Earth 's magnetic field at the time of formation 
This record is retained permanently so if a specimen of rock is put into the detecting instrument and various careful measurements made it is possible to find out what the Earth 's magnetic field was like at the time when the basalt cooled from its original molten state  We are all used to thinking of the Earth as some kind of large magnet with two magnetic poles located quite near the geographic North and South Poles so that the needle of a compass always lines up in the same direction 
We are so sure of this that we go out confidently into the hills or sail away in boats armed only with a magnetic compass certain that it will always point in the same north-south direction so we can judge our own direction of travel from it  Over the period of a man 's life small changes are in fact detectable the magnetic poles wander very slowly around the geographic poles so the direction of magnetic north varies slightly from year to year 
To all intents and purposes though magnetic north remains north  But if we were gods and immortal and could sit ourselves comfortably to watch the years slide by with a magnetic compass conveniently to hand next to the ambrosia and nectar we 'd see something extraordinarily interesting 
After about 100,000 years or so the needle of the compass would abruptly become unstable and then swing round to face in the opposite direction so that what was once compass north would become compass south and vice versa  Nothing else would change though the north geographic pole would n't move and if we were to go outside to check up the sun would still rise and set in the same place and the Pole Star would appear at night over the local gas works 
All that would have happened is that for some reason the Earth 's magnetic field would have reversed itself  If after a stiff swig of nectar we were to watch further developments we 'd find that in another 100,000 years or so or even longer exactly the same thing would happen again and the compass would swing back suddenly to its original position 
This process would continue indefinitely with reversals taking place at intervals of as little as 100,000 years or as much as one million years but with the overall result that the compass spent about as much time pointing in one direction as it did in the other  No one yet knows quite why these reversals occur but they were the keystone to Vine and Matthews 's modification of Hess 's sea-floor spreading concept 
Reversals have so far as is known been taking place throughout geological time and the evidence of these reversals is stored up in the magnetic fabrics of the rocks of both the continents and the oceanic crust  A group of geophysicists who were working on the rocks of the floor of the north-east Pacific had discovered before Hess 's suggestion was published that instead of a random pattern of reversals such as were common on land the oceanic crust in the Pacific exhibited a pattern of strip reversals the rocks in each strip were magnetized in one fixed direction but the rocks in alternate parallel strips were magnetized in the reverse direction 
See Fig. 4  Hess did not appreciate the significance of these strip reversals but Vine and Matthews did and they suggested that while the sea-floor spreading concept was basically right it could be refined and that instead of the simple kind of gigantic conveyor belt that Hess had conceived with oceanic crust being generated at the ridges and moving away in opposite directions the situation was much more like that of a conveyor belt-cum-tape recorder 
As the moving convection cell carries basaltic crust away from the ridge slowly but continuously the magnetic reversals taking place every few hundred thousand years or so leave their imprints on the newly-formed rocks emerging from the ridge as every reversal occurs so it is recorded in the formation of reversely-magnetized strips on each side of the ridge  Once a strip of new ocean floor has been formed and acquired its magnetic recording nothing further happens to it but it continues to move away slowly from the ridge at a rate of anything up to several centimetres per year 
Three implications followed immediately from Vine and Matthews 's brilliantly original modification of sea-floor spreading first the strips should always be parallel to the ridge axes second they should be symmetrical about the ridge so that the strips on one side are mirror images of those on the other third and most important the rocks furthest away from the ridge should be older than those nearest to it  A great deal of effort was put into the collection of new data on the magnetic patterns of the ocean floors in the 1960s and this quickly demonstrated the correctness of the first two points the strips certainly were parallel to the ridges and symmetrical about them 
One of the classic studies of this time was that of the Reykjanes ridge part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge just south of Iceland  The map shows clearly how the magnetic pattern relates to the ridge 
See Fig. 5  The strips of course are not complete exact rectangles that would be asking too much but they obviously are strips and obviously are symmetrical about the ridge axis each black strip left of the axis can be matched with a similar black strip of equal width on the right of the axis at the same distance from it 
The third implication that the rocks furthest from the ridge should be the oldest was less easy to test  However in 1969 a large-scale American project JOIDES Joint Oceanographic Institutions Deep Earth Sampling was able to confirm it in the course of a programme of drilling into the deep ocean floors to sample the rocks and sediments there 
Thirty bore-holes were drilled in the Atlantic at various carefully-selected sites and in each hole the drill first passed through a thin surface layer of sediments into the basaltic rocks of the oceanic crust  The material obtained from the drill holes could then be dated both by sophisticated radio-isotope methods and by the more ordinary down-to-earth method of examining the kinds of fossil organism present in the sediments 
Different fossils are characteristic of different periods in the Earth 's history  In splendid confirmation of Vine and Matthews 's hypothesis it was found that the age of each sample was proportional to its distance from the mid-ocean ridge 
The bore-holes nearest the ridge gave ages below seven million years while those furthest away gave ages of over 160 million years  See Fig. 6 
With this discovery the concept of sea-floor spreading was home and dry and almost universally accepted  Many scientists saw at once its far-reaching implications and a whole spate of major papers were published in 1967 and 1968 which quite suddenly added up together to make a completely new way of looking at the Earth 's main working parts Plate Tectonics 
Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics  Part 2 Plate Tectonics 
It would probably be unfair to single out a single worker as the discoverer of Plate Tectonics but the term plates was first used by an American W. Jason Morgan who was following up earlier work by J. Tuzo Wilson of Toronto University  Almost at the same time D. P. McKenzie of Cambridge and R. L. Parker of the Scripps Institution in America had come to much the same conclusions as Wilson and together these scientists were responsible for what they called the New Global Tectonics 
That term did n't last long though and Plate Tectonics really came into being when scientists all over the world such as Isacks Oliver Sykes Le Pichon and Morgan to name but a few began to apply the new way of thinking to specific parts of the globe  They demonstrated that the crust of the Earth can be divided into seven large plates and many smaller ones and that all major crustal processes can be related to the relative movements between these plates 
Thus the oceanic ridges are sites of intense seismic activity a huge number of earthquakes occur along and beneath them  See Fig. 1 
Many thousands of earthquakes can be recorded along the ridges in any one year and a few of these are quite severe but since they are generally a long way from anywhere they do n't hit the headlines  For us though they are important because if one plotted a map to show the distribution of all earthquake centres in the world for the last ten years a large proportion of them would be scattered along the oceanic ridges 
And the rest  Most would be congregated around the circum-Pacific Ring of Fire 
The earthquakes in these Pacific coastal areas of course are notorious since they occur at sites beneath the continental crust with all too familiar effects on human life  These major linear belts of earthquake or seismic activity are used to divide the Earth up into major plates each plate being bounded by plate margins 
There are three types of plate margin two of which we have already come across  The mid-ocean ridges where oceanic crust is being continuously created are known as constructive plate margins while the deep ocean trenches which define the sites where the oceanic crust dives down again into the mantle are known as destructive plate margins 
There is also a third type called conservative or passive plate margins which are margins between plates at which nothing special happens the two plates merely slide sideways past each other without fuss or bother  It would be quite impossible to discuss all the plates and sub-plates making up the Earth 's crust in this book and it would n't be very useful either since some of them are extremely complex and not at all well understood 
But to get over the main ideas we will consider just two plates and the margins between them the East Pacific Plate and the South American-Atlantic Plate  We 'll make a hypothetical traverse from Easter Island on the East Pacific Rise an oceanic ridge remember right across South America as far as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge so we 'll be starting at one plate margin crossing a second and ending up at a third each of them of course marked by a major belt of seismic activity see Fig. 2 
Notice that there is no seismic zone along the east coast of South America the continental crust merely sits passively on top of the mantle  The East Pacific or Nazca Plate between the East Pacific Rise and the west coast of South America consists entirely of oceanic crust but the other plate consists of both continental crust South America and oceanic crust the bit of the South Atlantic Ocean floor between South America and the Mid-Atlantic ridge 
Easter Island where the traverse starts is entirely volcanic but it is really only an insignificant scrap of land in the vast Pacific  Geologically the most critical zone is the junction between the two plates which is defined by two major physical features the extreme depths of the Chile-Peru Trench which runs along just off-shore of the continent and the extreme heights of the Andes mountains the crest line of which runs parallel to and 350 kilometres east of the Trench see Fig. 3 
There is a vertical difference of something like fifteen kilometres between the two extremities  Using sensitive earthquake-detecting instruments seismographs or seismometers it is possible to pin down quite precisely the sites where the shock waves originate in this region and it can easily be shown that these sites are confined to a narrow belt which dips steeply down under the continental margin at about 60 degrees and which hits the surface just where the ocean is deepest in the Chile-Peru Trench 
These steeply-inclined belts or zones of earthquake sites are known now to exist all round the Pacific they are called Benioff zones after their discoverer the seismologist Hugo Benioff  Now seafloor spreading tells us that the oceanic crust of the Pacific is moving away from the East Pacific Rise towards South America 
But South America itself is moving away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge since the Atlantic Ocean is widening steadily as new oceanic crust is generated at the ridge  So what happens when the two plates meet 
A sort of steady-state continuous collision and the site of the collision is marked by a major belt of active volcanism the Andean part of the Ring of Fire  More fully it looks as though what happens is this 
The oceanic crust of the East Pacific Plate does collide with the continental mass of South America but instead of piling up in a heap it ducks down and dives under the continent the site of the bend being below the 7,500 metre deep Chile-Peru Trench while the zone of actual sliding contact between oceanic and continental crust is defined by the 60 degree dipping earthquake belt the Benioff zone  See Fig. 4 
A colossal amount of energy is involved in the process of the two massive plates sliding over one another and most of the energy is manifested in the form of heat  Any two surfaces rubbing together produce frictional heat such as a brake shoe pressing against a brake-drum 
Along the Benioff zone so much heat is generated that some of the rocks of the oceanic plate and the lower part of the continental plate melt and the molten material then moves upwards and away  To escape the heat has to travel up through quite large thicknesses of continental crust and a large proportion does not get very far instead it comes to rest and solidifies a few kilometres below the surface forming enormous masses of igneous rock which have been forced or intruded into the crust and are known as batholiths Greek origin meaning something like deep stones 
The rest of the melted material reaches the surface and is erupted as lava and ashes building up the narrow chain of volcanoes that runs the whole way up the South American continent  So Plate Tectonics with its underlying concepts of constructive and destructive plate margins explains very elegantly why volcanoes exist where they do in distinct chains 
So far though volcanoes have been discussed in rather general terms as though the volcanoes of the constructive plate margins were identical to those of the destructive  This is n't the case at all and to see why one need only to look at the composition of the rocks involved 
Hawaii and Iceland are nearly as far apart as it is possible to get on Earth but both are composed of basalts and oceanic volcanoes everywhere in the world are composed of almost identical basalts  There are small variations in composition from one island to another of course but these are insignificant and should not obscure the underlying fact that basalt constitutes a fundamental rock type common to all parts of the Earth 
Basalts form the entire oceanic crust of the Earth and all of this basalt originates in the same way from the melting of rocks in the upper part of the mantle underneath the ocean ridges  These source rocks are the peridotites and since geophysics tells us that the mantle consists of the same kind of material all over the world it 's clear that melting part of the mantle beneath Hawaii should produce the same kind of rocks as those produced by melting part of the mantle beneath Iceland 
The continental volcanoes are a different kettle of fish  The lavas of which they are built appear to come from three separate source areas 
Some comes directly from the upper mantle above the descending oceanic plate some from partial melting of the oceanic plate itself and some from the lower part of the continental crust  Some of the sea-floor sediments muds and oozes sitting on top of the oceanic plate also get melted 
The upshot of this is that while melting of the rocks of the oceanic plate by itself might produce rocks similar to those of the oceanic volcanoes when it gets melted at the Benioff zone a great deal of other material is added from the mantle peridotitic and from the continental crust granitic  Thus the volcanic rocks formed are drastically different from their oceanic counterparts 
They are the andesites named after the Andes where they make up almost all of the major volcanoes  Andesites come halfway between basalts and granites in almost every property silica content density colour and so on so they are known as intermediate rocks 
A typical andesite is light grey in colour contains about 60 per cent of silica silicon dioxide and has a conspicuous number of small white crystals a few millimetres across scattered throughout a fine-grained homogeneous matrix  These small crystals are known as phenocrysts and are one of the most characteristic features of andesites 
To sum up remember that basalts are produced at constructive plate margins oceanic ridges and andesites at destructive margins such as the Ring of Fire type  The two rocks are different in chemical composition and this difference manifests itself in a number of intriguing ways ways which a fair part of this book will be devoted to exploring 
Three Classic Eruptions  In the few thousand years that civilized man has lived on Earth there has been an extremely large number of volcanic eruptions 
Of this number the great majority went unrecorded probably even unobserved but a very few made such an impact on human affairs that they have become significant historical events and have been described and discussed in the minutest detail  The eruption which probably had the most far reaching effect on civilization was that of Santorin Thera in the Aegean in about 1470 B.C. This abruptly extinguished the highly-developed Minoan culture centred on Crete and because the eruption caused the submergence beneath the sea of a large part of the island of Santorin it may have given rise to the age-old legends of Atlantis the lost or drowned continent 
Most of the evidence for these legends is drawn from some rather vague references by the Greek historian Plato in particular a passage in his Timaeus But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods and one grievous day and night befell them when the whole body  of warriors was swallowed up by the earth and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished 
Although this written account is extremely tenuous patient archaeological excavations that have been going on for many years on Santorin are beginning to reveal a story to rival that of Pompeii  The eruption of the volcano buried a town Akrotiri which is thought to have had a population originally of about 30,000 
The eruption itself was preceded by at least two major earthquakes which seem to have scared off the inhabitants since they stripped the town of all movable objects and fled no bodies have been found in the ruins  When it came the eruption was of massive proportions and deposited a great thickness of ash which completely buried the town and it set off great tidal waves which may have been responsible for the termination of the Minoan civilization by ravaging the coastal towns all around Crete 
The excavations on Santorin are far from complete but already some of the wall paintings that have been recovered from the ruins and preserved in the museum at Athens have been ranked as amongst the most important artistic discoveries of the century  Since there still remains so much more archaeological work to do on Santorin three more completely documented eruptions will be described in this chapter 
These can be regarded as classics of their kind and are important not only because of their intrinsic interest as dramatic events in history but also because they illustrate some of the facets of volcanic eruptions which will be discussed in later chapters  The three volcanoes concerned are about as widely scattered around the world as possible Vesuvius in the Mediterranean Krakatoa in Indonesia and Mt Pelee in the Caribbean 
The latter two are simple destructive plate margin volcanoes but the Plate Tectonic setting of Vesuvius is a bit complex  Vesuvius A.D. 79 
On 5 February A.D. 62 a severe earthquake shook the area round what is now Naples on the west coast of Italy  In Roman times of course Naples and its sprawling suburbs did not exist but clustered around the shores of the bay of Naples there were many small thriving towns and ports 
See Fig. 1  Two of them Pompeii and Herculaneum which were located on the lower flanks of Vesuvius were particularly badly shaken by the shocks and some damage was done but the townspeople were not especially alarmed 
They simply rebuilt the fallen walls and carried on with their normal efficient and highly organized lives they did not associate the earthquake with Vesuvius and there was no particular reason why they should  Although they knew that it was a volcano it had been dormant for centuries and they had no records whatever of any eruptions 
So peaceful had the volcano been in fact that its fertile soils were extensively cultivated vineyards flourished on favoured sunny slopes and the people living on and around the volcano were enjoying the prosperity and security of the Roman empire at its height  The earthquake of course was an expensive nuisance but earthquakes had never been particularly rare events in Italy so little significance was attached to it 
See Fig. 2  During the next sixteen years minor earthquakes continued to shake the area spasmodically 
We now know that major eruptions are commonly preceded by seismic activity and these shocks would have provided ample warning of the forthcoming eruption had anyone been aware of their significance  No one was however and life went on normally until the very last moment 
On 24 August A.D. 79 with all its preliminary stirrings ignored Vesuvius burst into life and one of the most momentous eruptions in history commenced  It lasted two days 
At the end of it both Pompeii and Herculaneum had been obliterated and thousands of people killed  One of those to die was a naturalist and an Admiral in the Roman Navy Caius Plinius or Pliny the Elder who was a much-respected man and widely-known in his own time 
By one of the ironies of history it was the death of this great man that led to our having an extraordinarily vivid accurate eye-witness account of the events of 1,900 years ago  Because Pliny the Elder had been so widely-esteemed the historian Tacitus was anxious to find out more about the circumstances of his death and about the eruption in general so he asked Pliny 's nephew who was seventeen at the time and survived the eruption to provide him with details of what had happened 
Pliny the Younger 's account took the form of two letters to Tacitus in which he described the fate that befell his uncle and how he and his mother had fared  These letters are particularly valuable to us because Pliny was clearly aware of the need to describe objectively what he had experienced and to resist the temptation to exaggerate 
As he wrote himself Nec defuerunt quifictis mentionisque terroribus vera pericula augerunt  There were people too who added to the real perils by inventing fictitious dangers 
Well of course there always are  The following account is closely based on Pliny 's letters 
On the morning of 24 August the ninth day before the kalends of September when the various Plinys were all in Misenum a small town across the bay of Naples from Vesuvius a curious large cloud was seen in the sky over the volcano  At first it looked harmless enough and did not even seem to be coming from the mountain 
It grew rapidly however soon dispelling all doubts  Rising initially in a vertical plume for many thousands of metres and then spreading out laterally in the upper atmosphere it took on a shape rather like that of a pine tree with a trunk and branches 
The elder Pliny was full of curiosity at first and planned to sail across in his galley for a closer look but his nephew was not so keen on the idea and turned down his uncle 's invitation to go along as well pleading pressure of work  Before he had even set off however Pliny the Elder received urgent requests for help from people living nearer the volcano so his trip which had been intended as something of a scientific investigation rapidly became a rescue mission 
Pliny intended to try and evacuate people living on the coast immediately beneath the volcano in the area which is now Torre del Greco but as his galley approached the coast it was showered with hot ashes and sizeable lumps of pumice from the volcano  The shore was already becoming inaccessible as piles of ash accumulated so he was forced to abandon his attempt and turned to the south running before the wind to escape from the increasingly heavy rain of ashes 
He landed eventually at Stabiae near the present Castellammare where things were still fairly tolerable and there he encountered a friend of his one Pomponianus who was making frantic preparations to escape loading his possessions on to ships and fretting for a favourable wind so that he could put to sea  Full of confidence Pliny tried to calm down the overwrought Pomponianus and to demonstrate his own unconcern went off to freshen up in the local baths and subsequently sat down to eat a hearty meal 
As night fell on Stabiae Vesuvius presented an awesome sight with the oppressively heavy ash cloud above it lit up in a baleful red glare from the many fires that had been started by the rain of hot ash  Remarkably Pliny slept calmly during the early part of the night although ashes had begun to pile up outside the house but he eventually awoke as the situation deteriorated 
Pomponianus and his companions were badly worried both by the ash-fall and by the frequent tremors which were now shaking the house  After a discussion they decided that their best hope for safety would lie in leaving the house making for the shore and trying to get away in a ship 
Tying pillows to their heads with towels to protect themselves from the larger falling lumps they set off  It was totally dark blacker and denser than the darkest night even after dawn should have come as the thick cloud of ash hung over them cutting off the light from the sun 
Carrying torches to light their way they all reached the shore safely but to their dismay found the wind still unfavourable and the sea too rough to allow them to get away  At this point apparently Pliny became unwell he lay down on a cloth spread out for him and twice asked for water to drink 
Later on when wafts of sulphurous fumes from the volcano still so frequent that their chariots were constantly on the move despite having their wheels chocked with stones  Overhead lightning flickered frequently as the static electricity accumulating in the ash cloud discharged 
At one point they saw the sea receding from the near-by beaches sucked away and apparently forced back by the earthquakes so that quantities of sea creatures were left stranded  Ash began to sift down round them lightly at first adding to the horror of the situation 
Conditions were not so bad however that Pliny and his mother could not have got well away from the town into a safer region but they were reluctant to leave because they were worried and uncertain about the fate of the elder Pliny  They remained therefore on the outskirts of the town until terrified of being crushed by the mob they decided to seek refuge in the open fields but they had hardly agreed on this when fresh ash clouds denser than ever overwhelmed them and brought total darkness 
The darkness was so complete that Pliny compared it with a sealed room in which the lamp had been put out  It was infinitely more unnerving than that though for they were not in a sealed room but out in the open with the air rent with cries from the crowd screams of naked terror and prayers for deliverance 
The ash fall became heavier piling up around them so that they had periodically to shake themselves clear of it to prevent themselves being buried  This living nightmare lasted for many hours until a sickly daylight showed again and the sun could be seen once more through the haze of dust 
Peace returned and the dazed survivors were able to collect themselves find their friends and look about  Great changes had been wrought by the eruption 
See Fig. 3 Where once the smooth cone of Vesuvius had risen only a shattered stump now remained where once there had been fields and vineyards and all the normal clutter of the countryside there now stretched a silent grey carpet of ash mantling everything like a thick dirty snowfall  Amidst it all not a bird or insect stirred 
Pliny 's account naturally did n't go into the details of the mechanics of the eruption but his account is so illuminating that it is quite clear what happened and similar eruptions blasting large volumes of pumiceous ash into the air are still called Plinian eruptions  It was the heavy fall of ash from the eruption which brought an abrupt end to the town of Pompeii 
It almost disappeared under a carpet of pumice over three metres deep so that only the upper parts of some tall buildings emerged above it  With most of its inhabitants either dead or financially ruined by the eruption there was no hope at all of salvaging the buried town and it was abandoned 
So completely was it abandoned that with the passage of time and the weathering away of what little remained of it its location was forgotten although the facts of its existence and its fate were widely known  Centuries passed 
The Roman empire declined and fell the Dark Ages came and went new peoples settled round Vesuvius and ultimately new towns began to spring up  In 1595 some remains of the city came to light during excavation work for a new aqueduct a few coins and some fragments of marble tablets containing inscriptions referring to Pompeii 
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when noble families all over Europe were becoming increasingly art-conscious in the wake of the Renaissance and anxious to fill their mansions and palaces with pieces of classical statuary and other antiquities the remains of Pompeii were ravaged haphazardly with innumerable random pits being dug in the hope of turning up items of value particularly small carved figures vases and pieces of jewellery  There was no pretence of archaeological intentions the subject had n't evolved by then Pompeii simply acted as a large open pit mine for works of art 
Sir William Hamilton Britain 's envoy to Naples was once deeply involved in this pillaging giving most of his acquisitions to his wife Emma better-known as Nelson 's mistress  Herculaneum suffered equally badly except that there underground shafts and tunnels had to be driven to get at the antiquities 
Things began to improve in the nineteenth century however when more coordinated methods were employed and for the first time digging began to be directed at finding out about Pompeii rather than making a profit  It has been said in fact that systematic archaeology was born in the ruins of Pompeii 
Although the excavations are not yet wholly complete many hectares of the town have now been revealed to the light of day and it is now possible to stroll along the abandoned streets once more with the remains of shops houses and villas on either side  The general impression is rather eerie but it is more reminiscent of a Second World War bombed city than of one abandoned nearly 2,000 years ago 
Judging by the size of the town it probably had a population of about 20,000 in A.D. 79  Many of these people were able to escape before the town was overwhelmed but about 2,000 died some because they elected to remain in what they thought was the safety of their houses some because they left their escape until it was too late some because they were too burdened down with prized possessions to move quickly enough and some because they were just plain unlucky 
It 's quite clear that the eruption was totally unexpected  The normal business life of the town continued right up to the last moment and in some houses food was laid out for meals that were never eaten 
Many corpses or rather fossils of corpses were found by the excavators in the ash  After death the bodies of the victims of the eruption were rapidly buried by the accumulating ash and rain falling on this ash soon after the eruption cemented it into a fairly hard mass before the flesh of the corpses had decayed 
The ash swelled slightly as a result of the wetting and set hard round the corpses making perfect natural moulds of them and in some cases preserving even the imprint of clothing and the details of facial expressions  These moulds were found as holes in the ash by the nineteenth century excavators and they discovered that by pouring in a setting compound such as plaster of Paris they could obtain a complete three dimensional cast of the original corpse 
Many hundreds of casts of these human fossils have since been made and from them we can learn a good deal about the last appalling hours in the life of Pompeii  A few of the victims who sought refuge in their houses were killed when the weight of accumulating ash caused the roofs to collapse but most were suffocated by the choking sulphurous fumes of the ash cloud 
The plaster casts demonstrate this with unpleasant clarity in many of them the hands are still pressed to the mouth preserving the last hopeless efforts to breathe  Those who died in the streets attempting to get away suffered the same agonizing fate and were stifled by the fumes 
The many casts all tell the same sad story  See Fig. 4 
One of the most pathetic is that of a pet dog which died still chained to a post  It survived for quite a long time until the accumulating ash had built up to such a thickness that its chain would no longer allow it to keep above the ash and it died its dreadful last moments clearly visible in its taut body arched back and straining neck 
Many of the human victims clearly left their homes feeling full of optimism carrying bags of gold pieces of jewellery and other valued objects which they refused to abandon even at the point of death  They died still clutching them 
At least one citizen died through coming back into the town after a great thickness of ash had accumulated and presumably during a lull in the eruption either to loot or to rescue his own little hoard of gold  So great is the lure of material possessions 
Pompeii was not the only town to suffer from the rain of pumice and ash the fall-out in fact covered an area of hundreds of square kilometres and several other Roman settlements but Pompeii was particularly badly hit because it was so close to the volcano and was down-wind of it so that the ash-laden eruption cloud was carried towards the town by the prevailing wind  Neighbouring Herculaneum suffered quite differently 
It was upwind of the volcano so it escaped the worst of the thick ash-fall that Pompeii experienced and almost all the population seem to have escaped unharmed not more than thirty skeletons have been found  The main difference though was that while Pompeii was obliterated by the steady accumulation of ashes over a long period perhaps as much as two days Herculaneum was overwhelmed in a matter of minutes possibly well after the eruption proper had ceased 
Great thicknesses of pumice and ash had piled up on the slopes of Vesuvius above Herculaneum and this loose material very rapidly became saturated by torrential rainstorms which may have been triggered by the eruption cloud itself the dust particles acting as nuclei on which water vapour could condense to form droplets  The waterlogged heaps of wet muck soon became unstable and eventually began to slide downwards quite suddenly becoming semi-liquid slurries or mudflows which swept down the sides of the volcano gathering speed and more and more material the whole time 
Some of these mudflows rushed through Herculaneum and engulfed it completely crushing some buildings and smothering the rest twenty metres deep in a slowly consolidating welter of mud pumice boulders and debris  So thoroughly buried was Herculaneum that a new town Resina has been built right on top of the old 
The compacted mudflow presents a much more serious problem to archaeologists than the relatively soft pumice of Pompeii and this coupled with the awkward presence of the new town on top of it makes it unlikely that it will ever be completely excavated  In some respects however Herculaneum is even better-preserved than Pompeii although it did not escape the attentions of the treasure seekers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and it has furnished an even greater wealth of detail than Pompeii on the day-to-day life of a flourishing Roman town 
The social and historical value of both Herculaneum and Pompeii are well known and need not detain us here  The ash-fall which buried Pompeii and the mudflow which covered Herculaneum however are first-class examples of two major kinds of volcanic phenomena which have been repeated scores of times on different volcanoes in different parts of the world and we will be following them up more closely when we come to a detailed consideration of the mechanisms of eruptions 
The Sunda Straits between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra are one of the great sea lanes of the world  Even in the nineteenth century many hundreds of vessels passed through the Straits each year most of them small coasting ships but also a good many larger vessels trading between Europe and the East Indies Java and Sumatra were at that time prosperous Dutch colonies 
See Fig. 1  The Straits which are only twenty-four kilometres across at their narrowest point are not particularly deep averaging about 200 metres and there are a number of islands dotted about them 
Approximately thirty-two kilometres west of the narrowest point of the Straits there lay a small group of rather oddly-named islands Krakatoa Verlaten Island Lang Island and oddest of all Polish Hat  See Fig. 2 
Most of the coastal details of these islands were fairly well known to the hydrographers of both the British and Dutch navies but little was known about their inland geography  The largest of them Krakatoa was known to be about nine kilometres across from north to south and the British Admiralty charts showed it to consist of several volcanic cones arranged roughly in a line 
At the southern end of the line was a particularly prominent fresh-looking cone 798 metres high known by its Javanese name of Rakata  Somehow by the mangling that place names go through the name Krakatoa was corrupted from Rakata 
At the northern end was a much lower broader cone Perboewetan whose crater wall had been breached at some time in the past by a large lava flow  None of the islands was inhabited nor were they often visited except by woodcutters from both shores of the Straits who landed periodically to fell timber in the luxuriant tropical forests that clothed the islands 
From time to time too native fishermen would anchor in their sheltered bays to take on water or ride out storms  Some of the Naval survey parties may also have landed briefly on Krakatoa because a hot spring is marked on some maps but apart from this we know remarkably little about the islands or their volcanic history 
There are some reports of a major eruption which took place between May 1680 and November 1681 and this eruption is said to have stripped bare the rich vegetation and ejected vast quantities of pumice that covered all the surrounding seas but this is all that is known  It is n't even known where on Krakatoa the eruption was centred but the chances are that it was Perboewetan since the lava flows in the crater looked extremely fresh when they were examined in the nineteenth century 
It 's possible that some other minor eruptions occurred between 1681 and 1883 but if they did there is no record of them and all of the reports and descriptions made by ships passing Krakatoa suggest that it was quite dormant  The islands were well-known for their beauty to the passengers of the steamships passing up and down the Straits but few of those who leant on their ship 's rail on sultry moonlit evenings gazing out at the serene islands could ever have conceived that they were to be the site of some of the most catastrophic events that the world has ever seen 
The first intimations that the forces which had lain dormant for two centuries would soon be unleashed came in the late 1870s when frequent minor earthquakes began to shake the areas round the Sunda Straits  A particularly big tremor on 1 September 1880 damaged an important lighthouse on the Java coast and was perceptible as far away as northern Australia 
But Indonesia in common with Vesuvius and almost all volcanic areas in the world is located in the middle of an intensely active seismic zone so earthquakes in the area were far from uncommon and the local people did not attach much special significance to this latest bout of tremors  The seismic activity gradually increased in intensity until on Sunday 20 May 1883 Krakatoa abruptly came to life announcing its re-awakening with a series of explosions audible in towns over 150 kilometres away 
These went on for several hours rattling doors and windows almost continuously  On the following day a sprinkling of ash fell over a wide area and a great column of steam was seen rising above Krakatoa leaving no doubt that a major eruption was under way 
This vigorous phase continued for a few days with the column of steam and ash climbing eleven kilometres high above the volcano and showering ash over points up to 480 kilometres distant  By 27 May though things had quietened down sufficiently for a daring or foolhardy party to charter a steamboat from Batavia now Djakarta and sail out to the islands to see what was going on 
The noise at one point as the party approached the island was quite deafening  In the words of one of them the background noise was so loud that a rifle shot sounded comparable to the popping of a champagne cork amid the hubbub of a banquet 
Sophisticated crowd these Dutch colonials  From their boat they saw that everything on the island was entirely covered with fine white dust like snow and that the trees on the northern part of Krakatoa and Verlaten Island had been stripped of their leaves and branches by the rain of falling pumice while those growing on Lang Island and Polish Hat seemed to have got away without much damage 
Scrambling ashore and scuffing their way inland through ankle-deep ash the party were able to see that the centre of all the excitement was the small cone of Perboewetan at the northern end of Krakatoa  This was in a state of semi-continuous eruption with minor explosions taking place every five or ten minutes showering fragments of pumice 200 metres into the air and occasionally revealing the cherry-red glow of liquid lava in the crater while all the while a great banner of steam rose 3,000 metres into the air 
The visiting party who were the first and last ever to get a good look at the crater of Perboewetan found it to be about 1,000 metres in diameter and about fifty metres deep with a small pit also about fifty metres deep in the centre of the crater floor it was from this pit that the steam cloud was escaping with a great roar  After this remarkable visit the volcano continued to be active for a week or two but the explosive activity died down somewhat and it began to look as though the eruption was going to be just a nine-days ' wonder and would soon fade away and be forgotten 
On 19 June however things began to warm up again and the plume of steam and ash which had been showing signs of flagging rose higher and higher as more and more powerful explosions shook the air  By the end of June observers on the mainland of Sumatra reported that all the higher parts of Perboewetan had been blown away and that a second eruption column was now rising from the centre of the island 
During the month of July many areas in Java and Sumatra were rocked both by explosive blasts of exceptional violence and by many minor earthquakes  Even this severe shaking however failed to cause alarm amongst the local people they had by that time been living with the eruption for many weeks and it is remarkable just to what extent familiarity of even something as exceptional as a volcanic eruption can breed contempt 
On 11 August a Dutch government surveyor Captain Ferzenaar made another examination of the island at close quarters but he prudently stayed on his boat  He reported that all of the formerly rampant vegetation on Krakatoa had now been destroyed with only a few of the thicker tree-trunks still rising above the thick mantle of ash and that there were now three major eruption columns carrying clouds of dust and pumice high into the air escaping from three separate vents 
One of these was the original pit at the centre of the Perboewetan crater the other two seemed to be more in the centre of the island  From the north-east side of the island Captain Ferzenaar also reported that he could see no less than eleven other minor centres of activity which were either emitting small columns of steam or occasionally ejecting dust in small explosive bursts 
There may well have been others on other parts of the island but unfortunately the heavy curtain of dust and fumes being carried by the wind prevented him getting right round  Captain Ferzenaar 's observations on the state of Krakatoa in early August even though made only from a boat keeping to the upwind side are particularly useful because they provide the last reliable account of the situation before the culminating events which ensued fifteen days later 
Volcanic eruptions are sometimes compared with the drama colour and spectacle of Wagner 's operas the Ride of the Valkyries has been used very effectively as the background music to a film of some particularly lurid eruptions  Wagner 's operas are remarkable for their length their tedium and the magnificence of their occasional climaxes 
The eruption of Krakatoa has some parallels in these respects for after an impressive opening the eruption dragged on for a full three months before reaching its climax on 26 and 27 August  So extensive was the havoc wrought in those two days that it was only many months afterwards that a complete picture began to emerge of what had happened 
The Dutch government appointed a fact-finding Scientific Commission in October 1883 and they published a preliminary report some six months later  The Royal Society in Britain also set up a committee to investigate the scientific aspects of the eruption and published a weighty tome containing the committee 's findings in 1888 
These two reports remain the source of almost all the information about the eruption the Royal Society in particular went to great lengths to amass every possible scrap of information and even inserted a notice in The Times requesting anyone who had seen or heard anything to come forward  Part of the difficulty in compiling these accounts was that there were so few survivors from the coastal towns in the Sunda Straits which were most directly affected and those who had survived were often too distraught and confused to give an accurate description of what they had experienced 
The best eye-witness reports came from European officials living in the two important towns of Batavia and Buitenzorg where there were even some useful scientific recording instruments one of them at the Batavia town gasworks and from the officers on board the various vessels that were on passage through the Straits at the time of the eruption  There were a great number of these at different points along the Straits but there were three that found themselves right in the thick of things 
First there was the British ship Charles Bal under Captain Watson on voyage to Hong Kong which was sailing eastwards through the Straits on 26 August keeping to the south of Krakatoa and passing about sixteen kilometres distant  Second there was a local Indonesian vessel the Gouveneur-Generaal Loudon which was plying back and forth across the Straits between Anjer in Java and Telok Betong in Sumatra 
She passed about forty-eight kilometres north of Krakatoa on the evening of the twenty-sixth spent the night of the twenty-sixth to seventh anchored in Telok Betong tried to sail again for Anjer in the morning but was prevented from doing so by the violence of the eruption  Third there was another British vessel the Sir Robert Sale which was at the eastern narrower end of the Straits sixty-four kilometres from Krakatoa on the twenty-sixth and attempted to sail westwards towards Krakatoa on the twenty-seventh but was quite unable to do so 
Apart from these three reports came in to the Royal Society from more than fifty other vessels whose log-books provided a valuable source of information particularly since officers-of-the-watch habitually keep a note of the time at which observations are made  After months of sifting through scores of reports from observers at sea and on dry land the geologist in charge of the Dutch investigation R.D. Verbeek was able to piece together a comprehensive account of the events of the two fateful days Sunday 26 and Monday 27 August 
All the reports agreed that there had been a gradual but marked increase in the intensity of activity on Krakatoa during the three days preceding the twenty-sixth  At 1 p.m. on the twenty-sixth explosions loud enough to be heard well over 150 kilometres away were taking place at intervals of about ten minutes and at about 2 p.m. an English ship 120 kilometres from the scene sighted a black cloud rising to an altitude estimated to be about twenty-five kilometres above the volcano 
By 3 p.m. the explosions were so loud that they were audible 240 kilometres away by 5 p.m. they were so stupendous that the sound was carrying all over Java  In towns such as Batavia 160 kilometres from Krakatoa the din was terrific the noise being compared with the discharge of artillery close at hand 
causing rattling of windows and shaking of pictures chandeliers and other hanging objects  The same pattern of events continued throughout Sunday evening and most of the night 
The Charles Bal which was at its closest to the volcano at this time reported  sounds like discharges of artillery at intervals of a second of time and a crackling noise probably due to the impact of fragments in the atmosphere 
the whole commotion increasing towards 5 p.m. when it became so intense that the captain feared to continue his voyage and began to shorten sail  From 5 to 6 p.m. a rain of pumice in large pieces quite warm fell upon the ship 
Captain Woolridge on the Sir Robert Sale rather further away reported seeing the eruption column rising above the volcano  a most terrible appearance the dense mass of clouds being covered with a murky tinge with fierce flashes of lightning 
A little later at 7 p.m. the whole scene was lit up from time to time by electrical discharges and at one time the cloud above the mountain presented the appearance of an immense pine tree with the stem and branches formed with volcanic lightning  There 's an interesting analogy here with Pliny 's description of the great cloud at the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius 
Things became so bad for the Charles Bal later on in the evening that she had to spend the entire night tacking back and forth south east of Krakatoa probably remaining within twenty kilometres of it the ash-fall from the eruption was so thick that Captain Watson could not see well enough to steer away to safety but ironically the glare from the volcano provided a weird and somewhat improbable lighthouse  A less pleasant night can scarcely be imagined with a steady rain of hot ashes falling on the ship and the air laden with hot choking fumes of sulphurous gases 
To make matters worse peculiar pinky glows of static electricity lit up the mastheads and rigging of the ship with an unearthly light  On the Gouveneur-Generaal Loudon this phenomenon known to mariners as St Elmo 's Fire was even more extensive and the native crew engaged themselves busily in putting out this phosphorescent light with their hands 
and pleaded that if this light  made its way below a hole would burst in the ship not that they feared the ship taking fire but they thought the light was the work of evil spirits 
The peculiar phosphorescent glow was the result of the atmosphere around the ship being highly-charged with static electricity generated by the rush of the steam through the volcanic vent and the friction between the myriads of fragmentary particles that were blasted up with it  After 4 a.m. on the morning of the twenty-seventh the eruption appeared to die down a little but the grandest moments were yet to come 
They came in the form of series of explosions on a far greater scale even than any of the preceding ones and greater than anything that man has experienced before or since  According to the painstaking analysis of the records by Verbeek the largest of these took place at 05.30 06.44 10.02 and 10.52 Krakatoa time on the morning of 27 August of these the third was much the most violent 
The sound of these great explosions was audible over a large part of the Earth 's surface at Elsey Creek in South Australia 3,224 kilometres from Krakatoa the noise was loud enough to wake sleeping people who described it as being similar to the sound of rock being blasted  At Diego Garcia Island 3,647 kilometres away in the Indian Ocean the sounds of the explosions were at first thought to be coming from a ship in distress firing its guns to attract attention so the people ran out to vantage points on the coast of the island to try to see it 
The furthest point to which the sound carried was Rodriguez Island 4,811 kilometres distant near Mauritius in the Indian Ocean where the sounds were also taken for gunfire at first  Nearer Krakatoa the effects were much more serious 
At Batavia and Buitenzorg the blast blew in dozens of windows and even cracked walls  A barograph used to record the pressure of gas in the gasholder in Batavia enabled the times of arrival of the pressure waves from the explosions to be recorded accurately but the blast produced by the greatest of the explosions was such that the gasholder leapt out of its well causing the gas to escape 
Much the most destructive effects of the explosions however were a series of tsunamis often wrongly called tidal waves which swept up and down the shores of the Sunda Straits  It was these not so much the explosions per se that made the Krakatoa eruption the most lethal on record 
Very few people are known to have been killed directly by the explosions great though they were but no less than 36,000 died when the tsunamis ripped over low-lying areas all along the coasts overwhelming towns and villages  The port of Anjer quite simply ceased to exist as the succession of great waves washed over it carrying away all the flimsy wooden buildings that made up the town 
The climactic series of explosions of 27 August added volumes of fresh material to the already huge eruption column above the volcano and some estimates suggest that it rose as much as eighty kilometres into the air  The ash raining down from it added to the misery of the people in the area the Sir Robert Sale reported lumps the size of pumpkins falling on her decks and she was at least forty kilometres distant 
At Batavia the pall of ash took a fair while to arrive in the early morning of the twenty-seventh the sky was clear but by 10.15 it had become lurid and yellowish as the ash spread across the sky by 10.30 the first fine ash was actually sifting softly down on to the streets  At 11 a.m. a heavy rain of ash was falling and by 11.20 the air was so thick with ash and pumice dust that the sun was blotted out and total darkness fell on the city remaining until 1 p.m 
The ash-fall itself ceased two hours later  Since Batavia was over 160 kilometres from Krakatoa it escaped fairly lightly in some places nearer the volcano total unrelieved darkness lasted nearly two days 
These awful conditions naturally made it quite impossible to tell what was happening actually on Krakatoa but it is thought that some milder explosive activity continued  The Charles Bal and Sir Robert Sale were beating about in the darkness for the whole of the twenty-seventh and ash rained down on them so steadily that the crews had to spend hours shovelling it off the decks and shaking it clear of sails and rigging 
On the Gouveneur-Generaal Loudon it was reported that at one time dust and water were falling together as mud and a thickness of fifteen centimetres accumulated in only ten minutes  Fortunately this soon declined to a more tolerable rate 
At 7 p.m. on the twenty-seventh another outbreak of fairly violent explosive activity occurred and got progressively more and more vigorous until 11 p.m. when it started to decline  These outbursts marked the end of the entire eruption for at 2.30 p.m. on the twenty-eighth after being active for a hundred days the last mild explosion echoed out over Krakatoa and silence returned 
Slowly life returned to something like normal in the Straits and the bewildered survivors were able to bury their dead and salvage what they could of homes in towns and villages that had been swept by tsunamis and showered with ash  Initially the great masses of floating pumice which had piled up on the sea made it difficult for ships to force their way through the water rafts three metres thick were reported in places but eventually parties were able to reach the islands and determine what changes had taken place 
The Royal Dutch Navy made a detailed survey of the whole group of islands immediately after the eruption and the maps they produced revealed the full extent of the effects of the explosions which had reverberated round so much of the world  The whole of the northern part of the island of Krakatoa had disappeared with the exception of a bank of pumice and a small isolated rock about ten metres square which was left standing above the ocean with deep water on either side 
Not a vestige remained of the cone Perboewetan and the whole of the northern part of the cone Rakata had been blown away leaving a semi-vertical vertical cliff  A great crater had been formed most of it below sea level and soundings showed that where land had once stood 300 metres above sea level the water was now 300 metres deep 
In all about two thirds of the island of Krakatoa had disappeared and Verbeek estimated that about fifteen cubic kilometres of matter had been ejected by the eruption  This fell as pumice and fine ash over an area of nearly four million square kilometres but most of it of course fell in the immediate vicinity of Krakatoa 
So while the island of Krakatoa ended up considerably smaller Yerlaten Island and Lang Island ended up much bigger due to the accumulation on them of enormous volumes of ash which also piled up in the sea to form sand banks  And Polish Hat 
Not a trace remained  See Fig. 3 The mighty Krakatoa eruption was compared in some ways with a Wagnerian opera 
In the case of the 1902 eruption of Mt Pelee there is no need to resort to such artificial comparisons because the eruption does in fact form the basis of an opera known as The Violins of St Jacques which has been performed in London within the last few years  The opera by Malcolm Williamson was itself based on a novel of the same name by Patrick Leigh Fermor who wove a complicated plot of romance and intrigue against the colourful background of a sultry Caribbean town in the midst of a hectic carnival while above the town a volcano rumbled threateningly 
The volcano ended up by destroying the entire island  In the book Mt Pelee is thinly disguised as the volcano Salpetriere while St Pierre the town which was actually involved in the eruption appears as St Jacques but the actual events of Thursday 8 May 1902 were so dramatic in themselves and the tragedy so complete that it seems a little unnecessary to dress up the facts in a romanticized account 
But this is probably better than some of the attempts that have been made deliberately to exploit the natural human interest in such a tragic event with supposedly factual accounts of the eruption in which accurate reportage takes second place to lurid entirely hypothetical detail  A recent offender makes its intentions of arousing morbid curiosity perfectly clear on its front cover proclaiming 30,000 people burned boiled and suffocated to death A whole thriving city levelled to the ground in seconds and The world best-selling account of one day when the earth exploded 
At the time of the eruption St Pierre was the principal town on Martinique a small island in the Caribbean and a prosperous French colony  Six kilometres north of the town rose the gentle slopes of Mt Pelee not a particularly impressive volcano only 2,250 metres high 
The island and the volcano were renowned for their beauty  To quote a contemporary description which reads rather like a modern travel brochure 
It has the softest of summer zephyrs blowing across its fields and hillsides swift and rumbling waters break through forest and plain and mountain heights rise to where they can gather the island 's mists to their crowns  There are pretty thatched cottages nestling in the shade of coconut mango and breadfruit and decked out with bright hibiscus and bougainvillaea 
The town of St Pierre itself was no less appealing stretching for some three kilometres along the shores of the Caribbean  It boasted a number of imposing public buildings including a town hall cathedral military hospital and a theatre and even had electric lighting unusual in those days 
Most of the town however consisted of a picturesque maze of narrow rambling streets lined with old-fashioned houses with steeply-pitching red-tiled roofs  The population of this delightful little town was estimated in the official census of 1894 to be 19,722 most of them Martiniquians a hybrid mixture of creole mulatto negro and coolie with a few French government officials and civil servants 
Like Krakatoa Mt Pelee had been active for quite a time before disaster struck  Whereas however the Krakatoa eruption was the first for two centuries Mt Pelee had previously erupted within the living memory of some of the older residents of St Pierre a mild affair in 1851 which did little apart from sprinkling a bit of ash about 
The first signs of the new eruption were seen on 23 March 1902 when a rambling party were making an ascent of the volcano  Looking down below them from the top they saw that a small crater with the remains of a dried-up lake in it was emitting sulphurous vapours from several points 
This crater was known as the Etang Sec or dry tarn a name worth remembering because it was later to become the focus of the eruption proper  On 25 April things began to liven up and minor explosive activity in the Etang Sec hurled ashes and bits of rock into the air and the eruption gradually increased in vigour 
On 27 April an investigating party climbed up from St Pierre to find out what was happening and found that the Etang Sec now contained a small lake in the middle of which a small volcanic cone had begun to grow  The days that followed this discovery saw a steady increase in activity with the town of St Pierre now being showered with light falls of ash and subjected to unpleasant wafts of sulphurous fumes 
Mrs Prentiss the wife of the American consul in St Pierre wrote a letter home The smell of sulphur is so strong that horses in the street stop and snort and some of them drop in their harness and die of suffocation  Many of the people are obliged to wear wet handkerchiefs to protect themselves from the strong fumes of sulphur 
By 3 and 4 May the situation was really bad with frequent loud explosions and substantial amounts of ash accumulating in the streets  The St Pierre local newspaper Les Colonies carried an article saying The rain of ashes never ceases 
the passing of carriages is no longer heard in the streets  The wheels are muffled 
puffs of wind sweep the ashes from roofs and awnings and blow them into rooms the windows of which have imprudently been left open  The first major blow in the events of 1902 struck on 5 May when the crater lake in the Etang Sec burst through the crater walls and rushed down the valley of the Riviere Blanche 
The mass of new hot rock forcing its way up through the crater floor had both helped to displace the water from the crater and heated it up to nearly boiling point so it was a scalding torrent that flashed down the valley travelling at a speed of something like ninety kilometres an hour  As it flowed it incorporated into itself masses of loose debris mud rubble and boulders some of them reported to weigh fifty tons 
This peculiarly unpleasant mixture combined to become a mudflow which over-ran everything in its path in particular a large sugar processing plant the Usine Guerin which stood on a tongue of flat land in the valley of the Riviere Blanche surrounded by sugar-cane plantations  Thirty workmen died in the factory of which nothing remained but a tall chimney stack sticking up like a post above a desert of black boiling and seething mud 
as if this were not bad enough the great mudflow rolled on into the sea at the mouth of the Riviere Blanche setting up a series of waves as it did so one of which was powerful enough to capsize the yacht Precheur moored off the river mouth  All on board died 
Some accounts also suggest that these waves swept over the low-lying parts of St Pierre near the waterfront causing some damage and casualties  As the situation went from bad to worse the people living near the volcano became increasingly distressed and many tried to leave St Pierre heading for Fort-de-France Martinique 's second town 
The local authorities however did not welcome the prospect of a large-scale evacuation  Apart from the problem of dealing with large numbers of frightened refugees there was also an election coming up on 10 May and the political factions in the town were anxious that nothing should interfere with it so there was a concerted effort to play down the possible risk 
A scientific commission comprising some of the most learned people on the island was set up and they produced a report designed to set fears at rest  One of the members of this commission and principal of the Lycee Monsieur Landes was rather worried by events but when interviewed by the local newspaper made a cautious noncommittal statement and warned that some of the areas nearest the volcano should be evacuated 
The nub of Monsieur Landes 's thinking was that Mt Pelee presented no more danger to St Pierre than Vesuvius did to Naples a distinctly ambiguous conclusion  The editor of Les Colonies however seized on this statement and in an editorial in the very last issue his paper was ever to publish tried to use it to encourage people to stay in St Pierre 
Where he asked could one be better than at St Pierre  Do those who invade Fort-de-France believe that they will be better off there than here should the earth begin to quake 
This is a foolish error against which the populace should be warned  His appeal must have met with some response because although some hundreds of people did leave for Fort-de-France many hundreds more sought refuge in St Pierre itself flocking in from the surrounding countryside so that on the morning of 8 May as many as 30,000 people were probably crowding the town 
Mrs Prentiss the American consul 's wife in her last letter to America said that she had the opportunity of leaving St Pierre with her husband on an American schooner but decided that the situation did not warrant it  She died with her husband on the next day only a few hours after writing her letter 
At 07.52 St Pierre time on 8 May the telegraph operator in St Pierre tapped out the single word Allez to his opposite number in Fort-de-France meaning that he was ready to receive a message  It was the last word to come out of St Pierre 
We shall never know exactly the sequence of events in St Pierre on that morning but we can build up a fairly accurate picture from the physical evidence of the ruins and the reports of eyewitnesses  We can at least be sure of the time when the town died because apart from the abrupt halt in telegraph traffic the big clock on the Military Hospital was found intact in the smouldering ruins with its hands stopped at 07.52 
8 May was Ascension Day and many faithful Catholics had assembled in the Cathedral to celebrate the day and to pray for deliverance from the volcano  At about 07.50 a series of deafening detonations was heard and a great black cloud was seen to issue out from near the top of Mt Pelee 
The cloud rolled effortlessly and relentlessly down the slopes of the volcano spreading out into a broad fan which rapidly engulfed St Pierre and in the next two or three minutes killed all but two of the population and set the town ablaze from end to end  The eye-witness accounts of what happened in those few minutes naturally vary in many details but one of the most reliable descriptions of the actual eruption of the cloud was that of Monsieur Roger Arnoux a member of the Astronomical Society of France who was observing from a vantage point well above and away from the town 
He was awakened by a minor earth tremor during the night of the seventh to the eighth but went back to sleep again and experienced nothing else untoward during the night  The following morning however at about 8 o'clock 
while still watching the crater I noticed a small cloud pass out followed two seconds later by a considerable cloud  This latter cloud rolled swiftly down towards St Pierre hugging the ground but extending upwards at the same time so that it was almost as high as it was long 
The vapours  were of a violet grey colour and seemingly very dense for although endowed with an almost inconceivably powerful ascensive force they retained to the zenith their rounded summits 
Innumerable electrical scintillations played through the chaos of vapours and at the same time that the ears were deafened by a frightful fracas  The phenomenon that M. Arnoux had observed and described so graphically was new to science and subsequently when other examples were observed on Mt Pelee they became known as nuees ardentes or glowing clouds 
These turbulent masses of superheated gases and incandescent solid particles present some fascinating problems to vulcanologists which will be discussed in a later chapter  The sailing ship Roraima arrived at St Pierre early in the morning of Thursday 8 May and anchored a little way off shore 
She could not have come at a worse time a few hours after she arrived she was a helpless burning hulk with most of her passengers and crew dead  A few survived though and were able to describe their experiences 
They had seen that the volcano was in eruption even before dropping anchor many of them had come up on deck to see the spectacle  At about 7.45 ship time they heard a major explosion and a few minutes later a searing hot blast of gas roared over St Pierre and the ships lying off shore capsizing the steam ship Grappler and rolling the Roraima so severely that she lost all her masts and smokestacks 
The fiery blast killed everyone on deck instantly with the single exception of the captain who lived on for a short time before becoming unconscious and falling overboard  The force of the blast was such that skylights were blown in and boiling hot mud and ashes rained down on those below decks killing many and scalding others 
The fiery blast or nuee ardente did not itself last long but it set St Pierre ablaze  Some of the damage was done by the thousands of casks of rum which were stored in the town and which exploded in the heat and caught fire immediately 
The Roraima survivors described burning rum running down the streets and even into the sea spreading out as far as the ship and causing small fires on her  The conflagration raged for many hours throughout the town spreading rapidly through buildings already torn open by the blast and with not a single person left alive to check it 
It is possible that a fire storm condition developed in the town similar to that which occurred in several German cities during the last war when saturation bombing raids started so many fires that the city became effectively one big fire sucking into itself hurricane force winds to bring fresh oxygen to the heart of the inferno  One consequence of the blaze in St Pierre was that it is difficult now to diagnose how much of the damage was a direct result of the nuee ardente and how much a result of the fires it started 
This is a matter of considerable importance since it is clearly desirable to know as much as possible about the conditions within the nuee ardente  One of the first to go ashore at St Pierre after the disaster was the Vicar-General of Martinique Monsieur Parel who was at Fort-de-France on the morning of the eighth having left St Pierre only the afternoon before 
He was able to join a rescue party which set off by boat from Fort-de-France and he returned to St Pierre a scant twenty-four hours after he had left  Let him describe the scene that met his eyes in his own words 
Thursday 8 May  Ascension Day 
This date should be written in blood  When at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon we rounded the last promontory which separated us from what was once the magnificent panorama of St Pierre we suddenly perceived at the opposite extremity of the roadstead the Riviere Blanche with its crest of vapour rushing madly into the sea 
Then a little further out blazes a great American packet the Roraima which arrived on the scene just in time to be overwhelmed by the catastrophe  Nearer the shore two other ships are in flames 
The coast is strewn with wreckage with the keels of the overturned boats all that remains of the twenty to thirty ships which lay at anchor here the day before  All along the quays for a distance of 200 metres piles of lumber are burning 
Here and there around the city  fires can be seen through the smoke 
But St Pierre in the morning throbbing with life thronged with people is no more  Its ruins stretch before us wrapped in their shroud of smoke and ashes gloomy and silent a city of the dead 
Our eyes seek out the inhabitants fleeing distracted or returning to look for the dead  Nothing to be seen 
No living soul appears in this desert of desolation encompassed by appalling silence  The blast that struck St Pierre was remarkable not only for its searing heat but also for its sheer force masonry walls one metre thick were blown down heavy cannon torn from their mounts and a three-ton statue carried sixteen metres 
Angelo Heilprin an American geologist who visited the scene a few weeks later and wrote a book about the tragedy described twisted bars of iron great masses of roof sheeting wrapped like cloth about posts upon which they had been flung and iron girders looped and festooned as if they had been made of rope  Amidst all this evidence of the effects of unlimited destructive powers unleashed there were small pockets in which some remarkable things survived delicate china cups corked bottles of water still drinkable little packets of starch in which the granules were untouched even a street fountain still splashed cold drinking water in one of the ruined streets 
Because the actual physical damage was so variable in its extent it was immediately obvious to the early investigators that the almost total mortality was not solely the result of the force of the blast since there would have been at least a few survivors in areas where the blast was less severe  Evidence that the heat of the blast was the cause of death was abundant there were many poignant scenes of entire families dead in rooms where glass bottles jugs bowls and cutlery stood perfectly undamaged on tables where they had been set out 
The many thousands of bodies in the ruins all told much the same story of practically instantaneous death when the searing hurricane from Mt Pelee reached them  There had been no time to attempt to flee or even to struggle hundreds simply died in their tracks 
The hot gas did its work swiftly extinguishing thousands of lives in the space of two or three minutes  Many of the victims of course were badly burned after death by the fires that swept the town but even those that died in the open showed severe burns on their bodies even though in many cases their clothes were not even singed 
This suggests that although the blast that killed them was intensely hot it lasted only a few moments not long enough to ignite fabrics  The story that the survivors from the town itself told the number varies in different accounts between two and four confirms this interpretation 
The most famous tale of all is that of the prisoner of St Pierre a murderer who was incarcerated in the town jail at the time of the disaster  Fortunately for him his cell was extremely secure partly below ground level without even a window the only aperture into it was a tiny grating above the door 
The prisoner a negro stevedore called Augustus Ciparis remained locked up in his cell for four days after St Pierre had been laid waste without food half-dead from burns and shock until his cries for help were heard by two negroes picking through the ruins of the town  When he had recovered from his ordeal Ciparis was able to tell of what had happened and he went on telling the story for the rest of his life for he was given a free pardon joined a travelling circus and became something of a celebrity 
On the morning of 8 May Ciparis had been waiting as usual for his breakfast to be brought to him when it suddenly grew dark and immediately afterwards hot air laden with ashes began to come through the grating over the door  It was not a strong gust but it was fiercely hot and he was severely burned all over his back and legs 
He was wearing a shirt and trousers at the time these were unmarked  The heat did not last for more than a few seconds and when it had passed Ciparis was left in an awful solitude his cries for help going unanswered as the city burned above him 
Had he not had a bowl of water in his cell he too would have succumbed before his rescuers found him  A second survivor a negro shoemaker called Leon Leandre had an equally lucky escape but in circumstances more difficult to understand since he was not below ground like Ciparis and several companions around him were all killed outright 
On 8 May about 8 o'clock in the morning I was seated on the doorstep of my house  all of a sudden I felt a terrible wind blowing the earth began to tremble and the sky suddenly became dark 
I turned to go into the house made with great difficulty the three or four steps that separated me from my room and felt my arms and legs burning also my body  I dropped upon a table 
At this moment four others sought refuge in my room crying and writhing in pain although their garments showed no signs of having been touched by flame  At the end of ten minutes one of these the young Delavaud girl aged about ten years fell dead the others left 
I then got up and went into another room where I found the father Delavaud still clothed and lying on the bed dead  He was purple and inflated but the clothing was intact 
I went out and found in the court two corpses interlocked they were the bodies of the two young men who had before been with me in the room  Crazed and almost overcome I threw myself upon a bed inert and awaiting death 
My senses returned to me in perhaps an hour when I beheld the roof burning  With sufficient strength left my legs bleeding and covered with burns I ran to Fonds-Saint-Denis six kilometres from St Pierre 
There are certain inconsistencies in Leandre 's story but he was obviously describing what he had experienced as well as he could remember it  It seems likely that he owed his remarkable escape to the fact that his house lay right on the fringe of the nuee ardente in the extreme south-east of the town so that he escaped its worst effects 
He was also a strong well-built man so his good physique may have helped him  So much for the death of St Pierre 
The eruption did not stop after the destruction of the city though and the nuee that was responsible for the tragedy was in volcanic terms a relatively minor affair and it was by no means the last from Mt Pelee  On 20 May a second powerful nuee swept through St Pierre flattening many of the ruins left by its predecessor but taking no lives there were none left to take 
See Fig. 1  Several other nuees swept harmlessly down the valley of the Riviere Blanche during the next couple of months but on 30 August death came again to Martinique where a powerful nuee blasted out from Mt Pelee and rolled down in a new direction engulfing the small village of Morne Rouge 
Two thousand people died in circumstances almost identical to those of St Pierre  After this final fatal episode the eruption dragged on for many months lasting well into 1903 
The ash which had been falling on St Pierre since the beginning of May 1902 continued to accumulate sifting down softly to cover the ruins of St Pierre in a grey pall and burying many of the bodies that still lay in the debris  See Fig. 2 
One should not attribute human qualities to natural phenomena but in a strange way the gentleness with which Mt Pelee buried its victims seemed like a sort of atonement for their deaths  A stranger gesture was to follow 
In November 1902 a great spine or pillar of solidified lava began to rise above the crater of the Etang Sec forced upwards by the pressure of the magma below  Growing at a rate of about ten metres a day by May 1903 the spine was no less than 310 metres high rearing up above St Pierre like a memorial obelisk a tribute to the thousands that had died below 
Volcanic eruptions are difficult things to classify  Most of the difficulty stems from the fact that an eruption is an extremely complex phenomenon 
A single eruption may not only last for months but it may also consist of a series of separate different phases and in many cases different things may be going on on different parts of the same volcano at the same time  However so long as one is aware of their limitations classifications are useful since they provide a series of labels to attach to different eruptions aiding recognition and simplifying the job of describing them 
There are two principal ways in which eruptions can be grouped  The first purely spatial method groups eruptions according to the shape of the volcanic vent and where this is situated relative to the volcanic edifice as a whole while the second depends on the character of the eruption itself and the nature of the deposits it produces 
Both of these methods will be discussed briefly but it 's important to remember that any particular grouping should only be applied to individual recognizable phases of an eruption and that it does n't necessarily apply to the whole thing  Spatial Groupings 
By far the most important division here is between central and fissure eruptions  If one had to define a volcano the definition would have to be something like a site where molten rocks magma have been erupted at the surface of the Earth 
Central vent and fissure eruptions represent the two basic ways in which magma can reach the surface  Central vent eruptions are the best-known kind 
Basically what happens is that lava and other material is ejected from a hole in the ground or crater which is fed by a single pipe-like supply channel extending deep down below ground  As the eruption continues the ejected material piles up round the vent building up that heap of material that is called a volcano 
The standard Fuji-like conical volcanoes are constructed in this way but a host of other forms can also develop in different circumstances  Central vent eruptions occur all over the world on the mid-ocean ridge volcanoes at destructive plate margins and along the African rift valleys there is no particular environment which is specially favourable to them 
Fissure eruptions are different in this respect  They occur in areas where the Earth 's crust is subjected to tensional forces trying to pull it apart 
Where this happens the crust may actually break gaping open in long narrow slot-like vertical cracks  At the surface these cracks may remain open and empty forming deep clefts but deeper down magma forces its way up into the crack widening it considerably by hydraulically wedging the walls apart 
These magma-filled cracks are known as dykes  If the magma pressure is great enough it will force its way right up the dyke to the surface spilling out to form lava flows 
This will happen more or less simultaneously at several points along the length of the dyke hence the name fissure eruptions  See Fig. 1 
If you reflect for a moment on which areas are likely to have rocks under tension and where cracking and dyke intrusion are likely you will realize that the mid-ocean ridges are hot favourites for this kind of activity  Iceland astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provides an excellent example 
With the Atlantic Ocean floor spreading away in opposite directions from the ridge Iceland is getting wider at a rate of about half a centimetre per year so a lot of new material has to be added continuously in the zone of tension in the middle or else the two halves would soon be completely separated  Most of the material is injected in the form of dykes which do n't reach the surface and it 's been estimated that the total thickness of dykes intruded in the last ninety million years is over 400 kilometres 
Since each dyke is quite narrow averaging only ten metres wide that 's an awful lot of dykes and a cross-section through Iceland would reveal hundreds and hundreds sometimes so closely spaced together that there would be scarcely any non-dyke material present and many dykes would be intruded up the middle of earlier ones  A few of these dykes reach the surface when they do so a fissure eruption takes place and basalt lavas pour out over the surface 
See Fig. 2  When particularly large volumes of basalt are involved such eruptions are commonly known as basaltic flood eruptions 
The most recent example of this kind took place in 1783 when lava was erupted from the twenty-five kilometre length of the Laki fissure in southern Iceland  The eruption lasted between June and November of that year and in those six months about eleven cubic kilometres of lava flowed out from the fissure covering an area of nearly 600 square kilometres 
Most of the lava followed the courses of river valleys principally the Skaftar and the Hverfisfljot and formed glowing rivers of rock over fifty-six kilometres long  So much lava flowed into the Skaftar valley that it was completely filled and lava began to spill out over the surrounding countryside 
See Fig. 3  The long-term results of this eruption were profound it proved to be Iceland 's worst ever disaster 
We 'll see why later  Apart from oceanic areas such as Iceland fissure or basaltic flood eruptions have also occurred in several important continental areas the western United States India South Africa and South America 
Most of these are rather old and do n't relate to the present Plate Tectonic picture but rather to the situation ten or twenty million years ago  It 's thought in fact that they represent areas where midocean ridges once formed below the continents in the late stages of continental rifting but before an ocean proper had opened cf. chapter one so in a sense the kind of volcanic activity that is typical of oceanic areas in fact took place on dry land 
Although they are now inactive these old regions of continental flood basalts are impressive because of the sheer quantity of lavas involved  In the Columbia River area of the western U.S.A. where most of the lavas were erupted about twenty million years ago such vast amounts of basalt were poured out on to the surface that hills 1,500 metres high were drowned in lava 
This did n't happen during a single eruption of course the individual flows average only ten metres thick so many hundreds of individual flows are piled up one on top of the other covering an area of about 130,000 square kilometres  See Fig. 4 
It 's not now possible to identify the fissures from which each of these thousands of lava flows were erupted but it is likely that each was produced by an eruption broadly similar to that of the Laki fissure  It may seem initially that differentiation between a central and a fissure eruption is the simplest thing in the world but unfortunately it 's not 
A lot depends on the scale that is considered  For example the Laki eruption taken as a whole constitutes a splendid example of a fissure eruption but along its twenty-five kilometre length dozens of small volcanic cones were built up none of them very big although each one if considered separately could be called a central vent volcano 
More important the big volcanoes which make up the Hawaiian Islands all seem at first sight to have central vents they are mountains thousands of metres high with craters right at the top  But the summit craters are situated on a fissure zone and most of the lavas that are erupted actually emerge from fissures 
This means that as the volcano grows it becomes elongated in the direction of the fissure zone  See Fig. 5 
So it 's impossible to make a hard and fast distinction between fissure and central eruptions  That is n't particularly important in itself but it does illustrate some of the difficulties involved in dealing with volcanoes 
Let's leave that problem though and look at a few of the more important kinds of places in which eruptions occur relative to a preexisting volcano  First all the activity may be confined to the summit crater at the top of the volcano just where one might expect it to be 
Second it 's possible for some explosive activity to take place in the summit crater but for most of the lava to be erupted quietly from a vent or fissure on the flanks of the volcano  Third there may be very little activity at the summit crater but the feeder pipe usually a dyke may branch off and most of the eruption may take place on the flanks of the volcano with a small cone being built up and lavas emerging from it 
This is called a lateral eruption  Finally by a natural progression there may be no activity at all in the summit crater instead the new eruption may take place completely independently of the main volcano and a new mini-volcano or parasitic cone may be built up 
In some cases such parasitic cones can outgrow their parents but at that point the term becomes irrelevant  See Fig.6 
Groupings Based on the Characters of Eruptions  In the past vulcanologists have traditionally grouped eruptions into a sequence of progressively more violently explosive types 
This is rather a subjective approach and has sometimes led to the situation where the same eruption has been given a different label by different observers  It is still useful though and is described in this chapter 
In the last few years a more objective method based on the properties of the material erupted has been devised  This method is particularly valuable since it can be applied to deposits produced by prehistoric eruptions for which of course there are no observer 's records 
This method will be discussed in chapter five  Hawaiian eruptions are the mildest of all and are characteristic of the Hawaiian island volcanoes which all have soft peaceful-sounding names such as Halemaumau Kilauea and Mauna Loa 
The important thing about these volcanoes is that since they are right in the middle of the Pacific they are basaltic and their basalts are hot and very fluid  When any supply of magma is present below a volcano it usually contains a great deal of gas and this gas is often at high pressure 
When the magma gets near the surface the gas expands and tries to escape  If it can escape freely then the eruption will not be violently explosive since all explosions are the result of the more or less instantaneous expansion of large volumes of gas 
Now since the Hawaiian basalts are so fluid any high-pressure volcanic gases present can blow off steadily without much fuss or bother and the rising magma can reach the surface to become lava and flow away quietly quietly from the vent  The Hawaiian lavas are so fluid in fact that as they stream away downhill they are often very graphically described as rivers of fire 
Sometimes when an eruption takes place within a large crater the lava ca n't flow away and gets ponded up in the crater  This has frequently happened on the Halemaumau volcano which has a deep circular pit-like crater about one and a half kilometres across at its summit 
This crater often gets filled with lakes of lava which remain molten for amazingly long periods  For a hundred years prior to 1924 the lake was present continually and has appeared and disappeared again several times since 
By night the lava lake presents an unearthly sight with great slabs of dark solidified crust shifting about slowly on the surface allowing the bright lava underneath to gleam through along the cracks between slabs  Sometimes small lava fountains play in the centre and these reveal just how completely liquid lava can be as it splashes and sloshes round the base of the fountain at other times small jets of gas blow up through the lava in fiery gouts churning up the lake into glowing whorls and currents of molten rock 
For long periods this somewhat improbable lake is so safe and tranquil that visitors can come right to the edge of the crater without the least hazard  Not surprisingly this lava lake is one of the most photographed features in Hawaii and the crater has been labelled in suitable post-card terminology The House of Everlasting Fire 
This by the way is something of a misnomer since although adjectives like fiery are often applied to volcanic phenomena count the number of times in this book it 's not strictly correct since there is rarely any actual fire in the sense of combustible material burning to produce flames and smoke  Almost all the red and yellow colours come from the glow of the hot lava and the smoke consists of steam dust clouds and fumes of sulphur dioxide and other pungent-smelling gases 
Very occasionally true flames are seen usually small and faint and these are believed to be produced by the burning of hydrogen gas escaping from the magma  The ease with which the dissolved high-pressure gases can escape from Hawaiian magmas leads to some very spectacular eruptions 
The pressure of the escaping gas sprays liquid lava high into the air just as a soda siphon squirts water to form fire fountains  See Fig. 1 
These fountains must surely be amongst the most remarkable of all natural phenomena the plumes of incandescent liquid rock commonly reach many tens of metres in height and one in 1959 reached not less than 400 metres  They are not just short squirts either 
Some fire fountains play for hours on end  Not unvaryingly though like the miserable affairs in Trafalgar Square but swelling dying away and surging up irregularly 
At the top of the fountain the spray breaks up into individual droplets which get carried by the wind and fall a long way from the vent so that downwind of the fountain there is a shifting curtain of glowing droplets showering down  Hawaiian-type eruptions are not confined to Hawaii although in few other areas are fire fountains quite so beautifully developed 
Similar lava lakes to that of Halemaumau have been reported from many strange places two of the most active volcanoes in Africa Nyamlagira and Nyiragongo have both had persistent lava lakes at different times in their history  Generalizing rather it is probably true to say that Hawaiian-type eruptions are more common on the oceanic island volcanoes than elsewhere though the examples of Nyiragongo and Nyamlagira emphasize that it is only a generalization since it is in these environments that the fluid basalt lavas are most likely to be found 
Slightly more explosive are Strombolian eruptions named after the tiny volcanic island of Stromboli between Sicily and Italy  See Fig. 2 Stromboli has been showing the same kind of activity more or less continuously for centuries and is often called the lighthouse of the Mediterranean 
In a typical Strombolian eruption basaltic lava is again involved but it is not quite as fluid as in the Hawaiian eruptions and gas escape takes place spasmodically in minor explosions every few minutes or so sometimes rhythmically and predictably sometimes irregularly  The explosions usually sound more like thumps and whooshes than proper bangs and there are sometimes sustained blasts like the din made by a powerful jet engine at close quarters 
Each explosion shoots out glowing fragments of semi-solid lava high into the air  These although they must be travelling very fast initially seem to move quite slowly twisting and turning lazily in the air and tracing out elegant parabolic paths as they fall back to earth round the vent 
When they hit the ground they may stop abruptly embedding themselves still glowing fuming and sizzling slightly in the loose ash or they may bounce off to leap down the steep sides of the cone in a series of great bounds developing a rapid spin as they do so and whirring downhill like cannonballs ending up in a rattling shower of small stones at the bottom  Sometimes when activity is particularly intense the wall of the crater is breached and a small lava flow emerges and flows away downhill and if this happens the activity tends to quieten down for a while 
Large volume lava flows though are not an essential part of a Strombolian eruption the term is usually used to describe the activity within the crater  Strombolian activity then is a bit noisier than Hawaiian but it 's still not particularly dangerous there are two villages on Stromboli only a couple of kilometres from the ever-active vent and the inhabitants rarely have cause to worry about whether they will live to see the sun rise on another day or on another boatload of visitors coming across to look at the volcano 
This kind of semi-continuous mild activity is quite common on volcanoes all over the world  Etna on the island of Sicily has been whooshing and thumping away in one or other of its twin summit craters intermittently for hundreds of years Milton refers to it as Thundering Aetna in Paradise Lost and the lurid spectacle of gouts of lava being ejected from the crater every few minutes makes an odd contrast with the winter sports going on on the smooth snowy slopes beneath the summit 
In a quite different part of the world the volcano Pacaya only thirty-two kilometres from Guatemala City in Central America is just as active if not more so and the red glare from the volcano can easily be seen from the city on a clear night  This is a relatively small volcano and so easily accessible that it has even been suggested that a hotel should be built beneath it to make an especially attractive night spot for jaded Guatemalans but so far no one has risked the capital 
Mt Erebus the 4,045 metres-high volcano near McMurdo Sound in the Antarctic also has bouts of mild Strombolian activity  It was in this state when a team consisting of six men from Scott 's base camp made an ascent of the volcano in December 1912 with a geologist Raymond Priestley in the lead 
The party reached the lip of the main summit crater safely only to find that it was quite docile and that there was little to see within the crater apart from dense swirling clouds of pungent sulphurous steam  They took some photographs left a record of their ascent in a sealed tin in a cairn and set off back down again 
About twenty metres down from the top Priestley realized that the tin they had left in the cairn in fact contained their exposed photographic plates and that what they were carrying down with them was the tin containing the record of their ascent  He sent back one of the party to retrieve the proper tin but no sooner had this poor unfortunate reached the crater rim than the volcano blew up in his face 
Fortunately he survived unscathed apart from being showered with dust and ash and inhaling a few lungfuls too many of sulphur dioxide fumes  Some way to the west of Stromboli and just to the north of Sicily are the Lipari Islands 
One of these islands contains a small and rather drab unimpressive-looking conical heap of rubble with a deep crater at its centre  This is Vulcano the ancestor of all volcanoes 
It has been intermittently active throughout history and may have been even more active in Greek and Roman times than it is now  To the Greeks Vulcano was known as Hiera the chimney of the forge of Hephaestus God of Fire but it was the Roman God of fire Vulcan blacksmith to the Gods whose name stuck 
Vulcan by the way is supposed to have forged the breastplate of Hercules and the shield of Achilles as well as the arrows of Apollo and Diana  And just to cap all this mythological irrelevance the island of Vulcano is now linked by a small spit of land to another small volcano Vulcanello which used to be a separate island and it has been suggested that this pair comprised the Scylla and Charybdis beloved of Homer and modern politicians but then so have several other island pairs in the Mediterranean 
Apart from this dubious distinction Vulcano has also given its name to a type of eruption the Vulcanian very different from the Strombolian  Several features identify these eruptions 
First they do n't occur often during the life of the volcano but when they do they may continue intermittently for several months  Second the magmas involved are much more viscous than those in Strombolian eruptions so that the explosive activity tends to be violent often demolishing parts of the volcanic structure 
In Strombolian eruptions the red-hot fragments of lava that are hurled out of the vent are usually fairly plastic smallish and do n't travel far  In a Vulcanian eruption the ejected material comes in the form of solid blocks and highly-fragmented ash and the explosions are often powerful enough to heave blocks weighing many tons clear of the crater while smaller ones may be thrown for a kilometre or more 
Third and perhaps most conspicuous a great plume of gas and ash rises above the crater rolling upwards in tight turbulent convolutions often to a height of several kilometres  A word here in passing about what actually goes to make up a typical volcanic eruption cloud 
Three quite separate elements may be involved all or any of which may be present at any one time  First there may be a more or less continuous emission of steam and other vapours not carrying much solid material which forms a white column rather like the plume above a power-station cooling tower 
Next intermittent or semi-continuous explosions may hurl solid material up in a dense dark mass with the leading fragments soaring straight up into the air trailing smaller fragments behind them and looking from a distance like rockets  These do n't usually rise more than a couple of hundred metres before falling back along parabolic paths 
The profile of this short-lived low-level blast cloud is supposed to look something like that of a clump of fir trees so it 's sometimes described as cypressoid  Such clouds are usually best developed in eruptions of marine volcanoes 
Last and most important is the cloud of fine ash which rises  If there are distinct separate explosions taking place during the eruption then a fresh ash cloud will develop after each explosion just like the ones produced by the explosion of a bomb or after blasting in a quarry 
If the explosive activity is more or less continuous then clearly ash will rise continuously  These debris laden clouds usually have a dark solid appearance often compared with the globular voluted surface of a cauliflower and rather like the black towering cumulus clouds that threaten thunderstorms 
Often the three elements are intermingled so that the result is a mixture of white streaked with the grey or black ashy material  Beneath and down-wind of the ash cloud there is a steady rain of fine ash particles sometimes falling so thickly that a dark curtain appears to be hanging beneath the cloud while in and around it electrical storms rage with lightning flickering frequently so that the whole effect is much more dramatic than even the most ominous of thunderclouds 
Vulcanian eruptions sometimes form the first phases of a longer eruption when the volcano is clearing its throat for the real business and as such there may be no new magmatic material involved and all the material that is showered up as ash to form the cauliflower cloud may be merely old cold solid lava which was previously blocking up the throat if this is the case the eruptions are sometimes called ultra-vulcanian  On the other hand though it 's quite possible for Vulcanian eruptions to continue for long periods with fresh viscous magma constantly being supplied 
Between 1963 and 1965 the volcano Irazu in Costa Rica was more or less continuously active with frequent explosions raining ash over a wide area and ruining the all-important coffee crop but throughout this time no lavas were erupted and there was no significant change in the pattern of the eruption  Vesuvian or sub-Plinian eruptions are one step further on from Vulcanian their principal distinguishing feature being that rather than intermittent explosions there is a fairly sustained blast of escaping gas from the throat of the volcano which carries the cauliflower cloud of ash much higher into the air 
These continuous blasts may last for several hours and in that time they eject large volumes of ash which is always new magmatic material rather than shattered bits and pieces of old rock  Vesuvius which is only about ten kilometres from the centre of Naples and in one of the most densely populated areas of Italy has an irregular cycle of eruptions with twenty-five to thirty years of quiet being followed by a major outburst when a great plume of dust and ash from the volcano rises over the city reaching many kilometres into the air 
The ash-fall from a typical Vesuvian eruption rarely causes casualties but it did cause problems during the most recent eruption in 1944 when Allied airfields in the Naples area were carpeted with ash making the runways temporarily unusable and gritty particles found their way into the air intakes of aircraft flying in the area  Pliny the Younger 's account of the death of his uncle during the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius has been commemorated in the term Plinian eruption the most violent of all in the sequence we have been considering 
Although their effects are more extensive Plinian eruptions are not basically very different qualitatively from the Vesuvian type  By the way do n't forget that it is only types of eruption that are being discussed and that any individual volcano may erupt in any of these ways or in none 
The one thing above all others which characterizes a Plinian eruption is the sheer volume of the fragmentary material ejected by the gas blast  Pompeii approximately eight kilometres from Vesuvius was buried over three metres deep in pumice in A.D. 79 and the total volume ejected in the forty-eight hours or so of that eruption was probably about three cubic kilometres 
Frequently too there are major structural changes to the volcano with a large part of it being blown away or collapsing to form a gaping crater up to several kilometres across  The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa was of this kind although the four explosions that took place at its climax were so stupendous that a separate type of eruption the Krakatoan is sometimes referred to 
Probably the best modern example of a Plinian eruption was that of the Bezymianny volcano in Kamchatka part of the Russian segment of the Ring of Fire  Bezymianny was a rather obscure volcano the name itself means no name before the eruption and was generally thought to be extinct 
The volcano was 3,102 metres high and had a conical profile  In September 1955 seismic activity began to make itself felt in the surrounding area gradually increasing in severity until 22 October when the eruption commenced 
For several months intermittent Vulcanian activity continued hurling ash between four and eight kilometres in the air but died down somewhat in early 1956  On 30 March however an exceptionally violent explosion occurred blowing off the top 200 metres of the volcano and propagating a dense eruption cloud which expanded upwards at a speed estimated to be something like 500 metres per second finally reaching a height of thirty-eight kilometres 
About four cubic kilometres of ash were ejected falling out over an area of 57,000 square kilometres  After the eruption it was found that almost the whole of one side of the cone had disappeared and it looked as if a giant bite had been taken out of it 
In the bite-shaped hollow a small mound of viscous lava was growing and continued to do so for a long time afterwards  The significance of this little mound will soon become apparent 
The 1902 eruption of Mt Pelee was the first recognized example of a Peleean eruption a very different kind of phenomenon from the ordinary Vesuvian or Plinian types although Peleean eruptions often occur as short-lived side-shows to the latter  Only one feature characterizes a Peleean eruption a nuee ardente or glowing cloud of the sort that had such lethal effects on St Pierre 
Remember that Mt Pelee unleashed several nuees during the eruption of 1902â€“3 but only two caused casualties  All of these nuees were linked with the growth of a large pile or dome of viscous lava on the site of the Etang Sec where the eruption first started 
For the most part the growth of this dome was accompanied by intermittent Vulcanian activity responsible for the loud explosions heard in St Pierre and for the ash that was showered down on the town before and after the fateful 8 May  On that date a part of the side of the dome was blown out and a large cloud was blasted out sideways rather than straight up as in a normal Vulcanian eruption 
This was a nuee  A nuee consists of an incandescent mass of solid fragments buoyed up by the rush of expanding heated gases 
The escaping gases rise upwards forming a turbulent dynamic wall while the denser part containing most of the solid material hugs the ground and rolls rapidly over it travelling at great speed since each particle of the solid material is in a more or less floating condition cushioned by escaping gas like a hovercraft  A nuee is at once immensely hot and immensely powerful the St Pierre nuee has often been called a tornadic blast and its destructive capabilities are all too clear 
It 's a little surprising then that similar phenomena had not been recognized prior to 1902 since they must have occurred on numerous occasions in the past  Since St Pierre though nuees have been observed in a number of different eruptions and in a great many of them they are linked with the construction of a lava dome 
So often in fact that the presence of such a dome is sometimes considered to be a characteristic feature of Peleean eruptions  This is where that small mound of lava on Bezymianny comes in 
This eruption could as well be termed Peleean as Plinian for part of the force of the great eruption of 1956 was expended in powerful nuees which swept down the flanks of the volcano with terrific force  Trees twenty-four kilometres from the volcano were felled by the blast and sandy ash carried by the nuees formed deposits over thirty centimetres thick even nine kilometres away 
Not all nuees are associated with lava domes though  Ironically enough only the day before the St Pierre tragedy a series of nuees were erupted from the volcano Soufriere on St Vincent 144 kilometres south of Martinique 
About one third of the island was devastated but fortunately it was thinly populated and casualties were relatively few only 1,350 people were killed  The interesting thing about the St Vincent nuees is that they were a side-effect of a conventional Vulcanian-type explosion column 
As this rose vertically into the air the nuees rolled away sideways from its base and down the flanks of the volcano  These radially-directed nuees are an example of a phenomenon known as the base surge or ground surge first recognized in studies of test explosions of nuclear weapons 
Next time you see that familiar mushroom cloud rearing up hopefully on your T.V. screen not across the road look at the base or stalk of the mushroom and you 'll almost certainly see a ring of cloud rolling away horizontally from it  That 's the base surge 
See Fig. 3 Remember the term because it will turn up again in a rather odd context  In 1951 a well-documented eruption of this kind took place on Mt Lamington in Papua another of those volcanoes which was thought to be extinct until something nasty happened 
After a few days of premonitory seismic activity the eruption started on 15 January and for a few days well-developed Vulcanian activity continued with frequent explosions and a great eruption cloud reaching up to 10,000 metres  At 10.40 on 20 January a climactic explosion occurred with a huge ash-laden cloud climbing upwards to a height of 13,000 metres in two minutes 
Base surges spread out radially in all directions from the base of the rising ash column rolling down the volcano at speeds of nearly a hundred kilometres per hour and covering an area of more than 230 square kilometres  See Fig. 4 
Within the affected area the destruction was almost complete and there were no survivors  The force of the blast was impressive 
The thick forests growing on the flanks of the volcano were completely levelled in some cases so completely that it was hard to tell that there once had been trees growing there  To quote the Australian vulcanologist G.A 
Taylor who reached the scene two days later in many places the only evidence of the forest cover was charred roots carved off level with  soil surface 
Elsewhere fully grown trees were uprooted and were found laid out in the direction of the blast  Near the village of Higaturu the mangled remains of a vehicle were found hanging upside down in a tree 
Most of the houses in the village itself were totally destroyed and 3,000 people were killed  Many other examples of Peleean eruptions are now known especially among the volcanoes in the Philippine Islands and they have been closely studied since there is considerable interest in how these eruptions occur and in particular how the material in a nuee is actually transported 
This is important because it is directly relevant to understanding the mechanism of a type of eruption not yet observed at first hand by any human being but one that would make the Mt Pelee eruption pale into insignificance if an example were to occur today  These eruptions give rise to rocks known as ignimbrites and they are so powerful that tens of cubic kilometres of ignimbrite can be erupted in nuee ardente-like incandescent clouds in the space of a few hours or days 
Less than one million years ago an eruption of this sort took place near Naples the ignimbrites erupted spread out over 5,000 square kilometres and performed the almost incredible feat of rushing up and over mountain passes 600 metres high  Such eruptions are clearly something rather special and will be discussed in more detail later 
In discussing the various types of eruption that are generally recognized it was emphasized that labels such as Strombolian or Plinian should only be applied to recognizable phases of an eruption they may not necessarily apply to the whole thing  To see just how important this is we 'll follow the course of one eruption from start to finish 
The example we 'll consider is that of Mt Etna in 1971  This was n't an especially spectacular event although it was the biggest eruption on Etna for some years and there were no casualties but none the less it was very instructive 
Etna is a big volcano much the highest in Europe and it has a record of activity going well back into history  It 's just over 3,300 metres high so that the top part is snow-covered for much of the year and the fortunate Sicilians can ride up in a cable car from the warmth of the lower slopes to ski there 
Etna has two summit craters the Main Crater and the North-East Crater both lying along the line of a fissure and the North-East Crater had been showing mild Strombolian activity for many years prior to the 1971 eruption  The first evidence that this was on its way was noticed towards the end of March when a patch of snow just below and to the south of the Main Crater began to melt and simultaneously activity in the North-East Crater began to die down 
On 5 April a set of fissures opened in the same place and showers of incandescent fragments of lava were ejected  These rapidly accumulated round the fissure building up into a conical heap and then as more and more new material emerged from the fissures lava flows were erupted and began to stream down the ski-slopes 
This was the first phase of the eruption it lasted about two weeks  Strombolian activity continued for most of this time in the little cone built up over the fissure until it was a respectable thirty metres or so in height while the lavas snaked down-slope in several glowing tongues permanently ruining many of the best skiing slopes engulfing one by one the pylons that carried the cable-way and demolishing the upper cable-station 
These flows were relatively small and they did n't get down to the lower inhabited parts of the mountain  Ironically though they demolished an imposing volcanological observatory built in the 19th century and modernized under Mussolini in the 1930s 
The second phase was completely different  A long linear fissure opened abruptly on 13 May well down on the eastern slopes of the volcano and at a height of only 1,800 metres 
There was no explosive activity no eruption column just a crack in the ground opening up and a few pungent blue sulphurous fumes  Soon though lava began to flow freely from the fissure quite quietly and in much greater volumes than in the first phase 
This undramatic release of large volumes of lava would if one had to give it a name probably best be described as a Hawaiian-type eruption  Since they were erupted so low down it was not long before the rivers of lava were flowing through inhabited areas 
They did a great deal of damage to vineyards roads bridges and houses and threatened the villages of St Alfio Fornazzo and Macchia  The people of St Alfio talked the local priest into exorcizing the lava with the help of sacred relics and with or without divine intervention the villages escaped serious damage 
The third and final phase was different again  On 18 May a deep pit-like hole opened high up on the volcano east of the Main Crater at a height of 2,980 metres 
No lava at all was erupted but great dark cauliflower explosion-clouds rolled out of it laying a thin carpet of ash downwind of the vent  This was classic Vulcanian activity 
So not counting the initial Strombolian activity in the North-East Crater there were three separate sites of activity during the course of the eruption and each showed different behaviour Strombolian Hawaiian and Vulcanian  See Fig. 1 
In part the difference in behaviour at the three sites reflects the relationship between a lava and its gas content a topic which will be discussed further in the next section  In the first phase the gas pressure on the magma was released by the mildly-explosive Strombolian activity 
This meant that the magma that fed the fissures of the second phase was almost completely de-gassed hence its quiet emission  The third Vulcanian phase also probably reflects this de-gassing process with gas escaping from the magma below accumulating in the higher parts of the volcano and then blasting its way to the surface 
This sort of pattern high-level de-gassing followed by low-level emission of gas-free lavas is typical of Etna and many other volcanoes  Controlling Factors in Eruptions 
The rather crude criterion that we have used to distinguish between types of eruption the degree of violence of explosiveness reflects two more fundamental variables the viscosity of the lava and the gas content  Let's have a closer look at these two viscosity first 
In common with all other liquids from petrol to treacle molten rocks have a viscosity and also in common with other liquids the viscosity decreases with increasing temperature  A hot lava freshly-erupted is a great deal less viscous than a cold one and it can therefore flow faster 
The temperature of a lava flow is naturally lower at its far end than at its source and this means that there are obvious differences in the speed at which the lava moves  At source a basalt lava may be moving at twenty or more kilometres an hour at the far end it may be oozing forward like treacle at only a few metres per hour so the temperature of a magma will obviously affect the style of an eruption considerably 
There 's a complication though  Not all magmas have the same composition and magmas with different compositions melt at different temperatures 
Basaltic rocks melt at about 1,100 degrees C while granitic rocks melt at only about 650â€“700 degrees C so magmas of granitic composition are many times more viscous than basaltic ones  In a Hawaiian eruption the magmas are basaltic hot and of low viscosity so they can be extruded from a vent as lavas with little effort 
Basaltic magmas are usually involved in most Strombolian eruptions too but these are slightly more viscous so there are rather more bangs and thumps but the material that is ejected is still fairly fluid  As one goes up the scale though one finds that magmas of more granitic composition are involved and they and the lavas they produce are more viscous 
The more viscous the lava the more difficult it is to force it through a vent and the vent may well become blocked with a slow-moving or stationary plug of lava  If this happens and gas pressure builds up beneath the plug a potentially highly-explosive situation develops 
In Vulcanian eruptions such a plug may be blown away by repeated explosions after which lavas may flow away quietly or if the magma is very viscous and keeps on coming explosions will continue  Highly-viscous lavas are always concerned in Peleean eruptions as we saw earlier a dome or plug of lava often builds up within the crater concerned blocking the throat of the volcano so that the pressures building up beneath can only be relieved by vigorous explosions which may be directed either upwards or sideways blasting out as nuees ardentes 
Evidence of just how viscous the lavas are and how great the forces involved are was provided by the great spine which was pushed up out of the vent of Mt Pelee reaching over 300 metres in height  A viscous magma however is not by itself explosive it is the gas content which is decisive and which puts the bang into an eruption 
If two magmas have identical viscosities it 's the one with the highest gas content that 's erupted most violently  In the case of the 1971 Etna eruption the magma involved was the same basaltic one throughout yet its behaviour was quite different in its de-gassed condition in the second phase from its original state in the first when the eruption was mildly explosive 
The contrast between gas-rich and gas-poor magmas is much more pronounced at the viscous granitic end of the scale  If such a granitic magma had a low gas content it would be erupted at the surface as a viscous lava flow which would ooze sluggishly out of the vent travel only a short distance and pile up into massive heaps 
If on the other hand the same granitic magma had a high gas content the result would be spectacularly different  As the magma approached the surface the pressure on it would decrease and the gas in it would expand as the gas expanded it would take up more room and this in turn would force the whole mass to rise faster and higher up the vent 
So a violent kind of self-accelerating process would take place with the magma rapidly blowing itself up into a froth of gas and liquid rock and blasting itself clear out of the vent  It is the myriad solidified fragments of this rock froth which form the large volumes of ash mantling the countryside round the volcano which is definitive of a Plinian eruption 
The light-weight rock froth itself is quite familiar and turns up in British bathrooms it is of course pumice  Submarine Eruptions 
Quite a large proportion of the world 's volcanoes are located on the oceanic crust most of them forming parts of the mid-ocean ridge systems  Inevitably therefore there must be a good many eruptions taking place below sea level so we will conclude this chapter by looking briefly at the sort of activity that results 
Two things stem directly from the location of a submarine eruption  First since the volcano is built on oceanic crust the magmas involved will be basaltic so that the sort of eruption that we can expect will be a modification of an ordinary Hawaiian or Strombolian eruption 
Second when red-hot magma comes into contact with a large volume of sea water the water is converted instantly into steam and an explosion results  So we can expect our submarine eruption to be much more explosive than its terrestrial counterpart 
The power of such underwater explosive activity was demonstrated forcibly in 1952 when a Japanese research vessel the No. 5 Kaiyo-Maru 211 tons was sent to investigate reports of a submarine eruption about 420 kilometres south of Tokyo  She never returned from that mission it is believed that an explosion took place while she was directly over the site of the volcano 
There were no survivors from the crew of thirty-one but some floating debris was found later with fragments of rock particles from the eruption deeply embedded within it  The ship had clearly been blown apart 
The effect of sea water on a basaltic magma is sometimes clearly displayed in places like Hawaii if there is a long active fissure extending from inland towards the coast  Along the inland part of the fissure ordinary Hawaiian-type eruptions will take place with lava being emitted quietly and perhaps a bit of fire-fountaining 
Near the sea though where water is able to penetrate inland and downwards through joints and cracks the activity is much more vigorous and in many respects resembles Vulcanian activity  A tall turbulent white steam column rolls upwards above the vent often becoming grey or black as ash is blasted upwards 
Frequent powerful explosions throw showers of fragments into the air forming the cypressoid eruption cloud mentioned earlier  It has recently been suggested that a good name for eruptions of this type would be Surtseyan after the eruption off Iceland in 1963 
When a volcano erupts actually beneath the sea a series of stages in the activity can usually be identified  At first there will be little to see other than an area of dirty discoloured water possibly hot or boiling and probably with a good many dead fish floating around in it 
Next explosive activity will start blasting ashy material in jets a couple of hundred metres above sea level  A more or less permanent steam column will soon establish itself and a Surtseyan eruption ensues with ejected material accumulating on the sea floor until there is such a pile that the top of it shows itself above sea level and an island is born 
The style of eruption does n't change much though until the island has grown substantially and a recognizable cone and crater have developed  By that time the feeder pipe of magma will have become fairly well insulated from the sea so for the first time the cherry red glow of liquid lava will be seen and small lava flows will emerge cementing the island together 
Mild explosive activity usually takes place in the crater throwing up showers of red-hot lava and in this condition the style is no longer Surtseyan but Strombolian and of course the eruption has ceased to be a strictly submarine one  The kinds of deposits that are produced by the submarine and surface phases of the same eruption are also quite different as we shall see 
In the last chapter the different types of volcanic eruption were described in this chapter and the two following some of the different types of rocks that result will be considered  It is important to emphasize how varied volcanoes can be in this respect 
Some volcanoes produce only one kind of rock during their entire lives but others show an impressive diversity  It is hard to imagine a greater contrast between two rock types than that between obsidian a natural volcanic glass which will shatter at a blow into razor-sharp splinters and pumice a rock so light and frothy that it will float on water 
Both however may be produced by a volcano during the course of a single eruption and they may be chemically identical  The pronounced physical differences between them result only from the contrasted ways in which they are erupted 
Obsidian is erupted quietly as lava forming thick sluggish flows while pumice is blasted out rapidly and blown up into a consistency something like expanded polystyrene with a delicate cellular structure that results from the expansion of large volumes of gas within the magma  Rocks like pumice which are ejected as broken solid fragments rather than in liquid form are known as pyroclastic rocks pyro fire clastic broken = broken by fire 
All volcanic rocks whatever their composition may turn up either as lavas or pyroclastics but rocks of some compositions are more often found as lavas while others are more common as pyroclastics  This is an important point and one that will be followed more closely 
First though a word about the stuff that rocks and minerals are made of  The Chemistry of Rocks 
When moving around the surface of the Earth one can not fail to be impressed by the diversity of all that one sees and it is easy to imagine that there is an infinite complexity of different things not apparently related to one another  In chemical terms though the situation is much simpler since all matter is composed of only a hundred or so elements 
So the apparently boundless diversity of plant life disappears when one recalls that all plants are composed of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and a few less important elements and that chemically there is little difference between a daisy and an oak tree  The same is true of rocks 
Thousands of different kinds of rocks have been described and separately named but when one gets down to their chemistry one finds that they all have a great deal in common  Ninety-two elements exist in nature and another dozen or so have been made by nuclear physicists 
Of these ninety-two only twelve occur in proportions greater than 0.1 per cent in the Earth 's crust  In the following table they are in order of abundance Percentage Oxygen 46.6 Silicon 27.7 Aluminium 8.1 Iron 5.0 Calcium 3.6 Sodium 2.8 Potassium 2.6 Magnesium 2.1 Titanium 0.4 Phosphorus 0.2 Manganese 0.1 Hydrogen 0.1 
Of these twelve the first eight are much the most abundant with silicon and oxygen head and shoulders above the rest  Silicon and oxygen in fact are the fundamental constituents of almost all the rocks in the Earth 's crust 
The two can occur just by themselves in a compound represented chemically as silicon dioxide this is silica and in the form of quartz it is one of the commonest rock-forming minerals in the world  Apart from quartz silicon and oxygen combine together to form an atomic building-block known as the silicon tetrahedron with a single atom of silica surrounded by four atoms of oxygen 
See Fig. 1 To get an idea of what a tetrahedron looks like in three dimensions look at one of those awkwardly-shaped cardboard milk cartons  They are made up of four triangular sides and are splendid tetrahedra 
This SiO4 building-block can combine with almost all of the other twelve elements in the list to form silicate minerals and these with quartz make up more than 99 per cent of all volcanic rocks  To be academic for a moment minerals can be defined as naturally formed inorganic substances which possess a definite chemical composition and a definite atomic structure 
Many thousands of separate natural minerals which fit this definition have been described and especially in the nineteenth century scientists spent decades of their lives in searching out new ones  Fortunately though all but a few volcanic rocks are built up by various combinations of only seven different minerals or rather mineral families 
Here they are Silicates Olivines Pyroxenes Amphiboles Micas Feldspars Quartz Oxides  The first six are all silicate minerals the last are also-rans making up the 1 per cent non-silicate content of volcanic rocks and are almost always oxides of iron and titanium 
The olivines pyroxenes amphiboles micas and feldspars are true families not individual minerals each family has the same atomic structure but the chemical composition of minerals in each family can vary widely within certain limits  The atomic structures which characterize each family are built up in different ways with the basic SiO4 building-block 
So volcanic rocks are composed of only a few mineral groups each group having its own characteristic atomic structure  Most volcanic rocks are composed of only four or so of these groups and there is a steady change in the proportions of different groups present as one goes from one end of the rock spectrum to another 
Rocks are classified chemically according to how much silica silicon dioxide they contain rocks with a lot of silica are known as acid  They consist mostly of quartz and feldspars with a little mica or amphibole 
Basic rocks form the other end of the spectrum they contain much less silicon dioxide there is no free quartz all the silica is present as silicates but there is a lot of feldspar and a great deal of pyroxene olivine and oxide minerals  Apart from quartz and the feldspars most minerals are dark in colour so basic rocks with no quartz tend to be dark-coloured while acid rocks are much lighter and usually have only isolated specks of dark minerals 
As far as actual examples of volcanic rocks are concerned it was mentioned that the most abundant are basalts which form at mid-ocean ridges and andesites which are formed at destructive plate margins  Basalts are examples of basic volcanic rocks while andesites are intermediate between basic and acid 
To these should be added a third group which are not so abundant in terms of volume but which are equally important  These are the rhyolites which are right at the other end of the spectrum from basalts that is to say they are acid contain a lot of silica and have the same composition as granite 
They are lighter in colour and lower in density than basalts or andesites and contain fewer dark minerals  Obsidian is a special kind of rhyolite it is a natural glass whereas ordinary rhyolites are not 
The important properties of these three principal volcanic rock groups can be summarized in simple tables  Property Basalt 
Silica content Least about 50% therefore basic  Content of dark minerals Highest 
Typical minerals Feldspar Pyroxene Olivine Oxides  Density Highest 
Melting point Highest  Viscosity as surface Least molten rock 
Tendency to form lavas Highest  Tendency to form pyroclastics Least 
Property Andesite  Silica content Intermediate â€“60% 
Content of dark minerals Intermediate  Typical minerals Feldspar Amphibole Pyroxene Mica 
Density Intermediate  Melting point Intermediate 
Viscosity as surface Intermediate molten rock  Tendency to form lavas Intermediate 
Tendency to form pyroclastics Intermediate  Property Rhyolite 
Silica content Most 65% therefore acid  Content of dark minerals Least 
Typical minerals Feldspar Quartz Mica Amphibole  Density Lowest 
Melting point Lowest  Viscosity as surface Highest molten rock 
Tendency to form lavas Least  Tendency to form pyroclastics Highest 
These tables illustrate the all-important variations in properties between the two extremes basalt and rhyolite  Fundamentally it is the differences in composition that are responsible for all the variations between the extremes and this produces an interesting chain of cause and effect which can be summed up like this 
Composition dictates melting temperature  Temperature dictates viscosity 
Viscosity dictates explosive potential of eruption  Explosiveness of eruption dictates whether lavas or pyroclastics are produced 
So while it may not seem obvious that two magmas differing only by 5 or 10 per cent in silica content should behave quite differently on eruption this chain of cause and effect operates to produce very substantial differences indeed  Physical Properties of Lava Flows 
Lavas are amongst the most harmless weapons in a volcano 's formidable armoury one can always see them coming and almost always get out of their way quickly enough  For all their harmlessness though they are still absorbingly interesting natural spectacles 
A specimen of basalt taken from a cold lava flow however is not a particularly inspiring object at all in most cases it probably looks like a dirty black lump of clinker  It is usually difficult to see the individual minerals making up a basalt since they are far too small so one has to use a microscope 
First though one has to obtain a very thin section of the rock thin enough to be translucent  Cutting these sections is a skilled job requiring the services of a technician in a specially-equipped workshop so there can be no question of using even the most portable of microscopes to study rocks in the field 
When a thin section of a basalt is examined under a microscope it can be seen to be made up of a closely-felted mass of interlocking needle-like crystals of feldspar a millimetre or so long with a scattering of more colourful tiny crystals of olivine and pyroxene and some black opaque specks of iron oxides  It is the word crystal that is important 
A crystalline substance is an ordered substance all the atoms in it are arranged in a regular geometrical pattern so when the lava cooled from its original molten condition the initial homogeneous liquid melt crystallized out to form well-ordered identifiable minerals  This may seem quite straightforward but it is important because in some cases this orderly process of crystallization does not take place and the result is a homogeneous lump of rock 
Different minerals crystallize at different temperatures so that when a basalt magma cools a sequence of minerals appears  The first mineral to crystallize is usually olivine which carries on crystallizing as the magma cools until a temperature is reached at which a second mineral pyroxene begins to appear and then as the temperature drops still further these two continue to crystallize together 
Finally a temperature is reached when a third mineral feldspar joins in  Crystallization then continues until the rock is completely solid 
Quite often olivine and pyroxene begin to crystallize out early on so they may be present in the final rock as quite large crystals up to a centimetre across many times larger than the crystals surrounding them and easily visible with the naked eye  So there is an important contrast here between the groundmass of tiny felted crystals and the much bigger separate phenocryst minerals 
Most volcanic rocks contain some phenocrysts they are a bit like the pips in raspberry jam  The groundmass crystals form when the lava cools on reaching the surface so the individual crystals are tiny simply because they do n't have the time to grow any larger in the relatively short period that the flow takes to cool 
The phenocryst minerals the pips in the jam however crystallize out much earlier while the magma is still underground  So they have plenty of time to grow to a respectable size and are merely carried passively up to the surface with the rest of the magma when it is erupted and are distributed uniformly throughout it 
But what about those lavas that solidify into one homogeneous lump without crystallizing  These are quite common but instead of being featureless uninteresting lumps they are highly distinctive natural glasses 
When a melt of any kind is cooled rapidly it does not have time to sort its atoms out into the ordered atomic structures of mineral crystals  The atoms are all frozen into the random positions they occupied in the liquid producing a material which is neither crystal nor liquid not crystal because it does n't have an ordered structure not liquid because it does n't flow 
It is in fact a supercooled liquid and if heated it would soften slowly over a broad temperature range rather than melting abruptly  Ordinary window glass is an example of matter in this state it is made by melting up silicate materials such as quartz sand and allowing the melt to cool under controlled conditions so that crystallization does not occur 
Glass however may crystallize out or devitrify in the solid state if it 's left long enough with myriads of tiny crystals forming and making it opaque  Brittle toffee is another example of a glass it consists mainly of non-crystalline sugar while some kinds of fudge are devitrified toffee 
When lava flows are erupted at the surface they are necessarily rapidly chilled and volcanic glasses are common  The surface layers of basalt flows are commonly glassy but deeper within the amount of glass gets less and more crystals appear until the whole mass is composed of crystals 
The transition from glass to crystals in a basalt may cover a few centimetres but in andesites and rhyolites it is much broader and large thicknesses of glass may be present  One of the most characteristic features of basalt lavas is that they are often riddled with holes 
Large quantities of gas may be involved in the eruption of basaltic lavas when the lava is below ground the gas is kept in solution in the molten rock when the pressure on the lava is reduced the gases come out of solution and bubbles form just as they do when a bottle of champagne is opened  If the bubbling gas can escape freely the lava will become de-gassed or flat and the rock that results will be free of bubbles 
If on the other hand gases continue to escape while the lava is being erupted bubbles will go on growing in the lava and these will be preserved in the rock when it cools  Normally these bubbles or vesicles are only a few millimetres across and quite thinly scattered but sometimes if the lava has been particularly gas rich the rock is so honeycombed with large bubbles that it looks like some kinds of Swiss cheese more holes than solid 
Gas bubbles in any liquid tend to rise to the surface so in any basalt lava flow it is only the top part which is likely to have a honeycomb texture  In the lower parts of the flow vesicles are much smaller and scarcer and are often absent altogether 
There are a great many other possible variables within a single basalt flow apart from the vesicle distribution  To get an idea of some of the many different features that can be produced consider what happens to a single large flow as it is traced from its source to its tip 
When it emerges from below ground a basalt lava is usually at a temperature of about 1,100 degrees C and it glows fiercely reddish yellow the colour of molten metal poured from a furnace  At this temperature the molten rock is at its least viscous and it flows downhill as a fiery river splashing and bounding over minor irregularities like a mountain stream and cascading over larger obstacles in glowing fire-falls 
As it flows the lava cools and its initial fierce glow subsides to a less intense yellow and more important the viscosity increases so that the lava becomes more like treacle  As the viscosity increases the lava flows more slowly and smoothly not as boisterously as at first 
In practical terms this means that when a yellow-hot lava is first emitted it can flow at a rate of many kilometres an hour but lower down on the flanks of the volcano when it is cooler it slows to the speed of a run and then of a fast walk  The actual rate of flow at any point will of course depend on the slope of the ground 
Further away from the source still the lava flows even slower and the yellow glow gives way to a bright cherry red and black streaks and blobs of chilled solid lava appear on the surface  Initially these are no more than tiny wisps streaked out on the surface of the lava like flecks of foam on a river which are soon engulfed once more in the main mass 
As the lava cools down further to a dull red more and more chilled fragments remain on the surface and these small particles soon agglomerate together forming progressively larger plates or rafts which cover the surface of the flow the hot lava itself only glowing through in the cracks between rafts  When the lava has reached this cherry red temperature it 's extremely viscous like sticky treacle and if one can get near enough to the flow to push a pole into it quite a lot of material can be collected and this can be carried away while still very hot and soft 
In many volcanic areas the locals make a practice of collecting small samples of lava in this way and then mould it while still hot into ashtrays medallions and so on to sell as souvenirs of the eruption  When a basalt flow has cooled sufficiently for some sort of crust to form one of two possible things can happen 
It can either form a thin skin-like layer of solid lava over the liquid rather like the skin that develops on custard or boiled milk or else it develops a rather thick rubbly surface layer consisting of loose blocks of solidified lava  This blocky layer is carried along on top of the moving flow looking for all the world like rocks on a conveyor belt in a quarry 
The custard-skin type of surface is not as common as the rubbly type but it is often particularly well-developed on oceanic volcanoes and especially on the Hawaiian islands  When lava like this comes to rest or slows down the skin piles up against itself buckling up into a closely-spaced series of pleats 
These pleats give the lava a ropy appearance and the flows are called by a name given to them by the Polynesian islanders pahoehoe flows  See Fig. 1 
The other kind of flow with the rubbly conveyor-belt surface is also known by a Polynesian name it is called an aa flow  Areas of many square kms can be covered by aa lavas and they present severe obstacles to anyone trying to cross them 
See Fig. 2  Every cindery boulder making up the jumbled chaotic surface is loose irregularly angular in shape and covered in razor-sharp protrusions 
Every step is a balancing act every slip of the foot means a series of razor-like slashes on one 's boots to fall means badly lacerated hands and knees  So crossing one of these flows is a dreary difficult and painful job 
No wonder the Polynesians call them aa flows and go round the long way  However unpleasant these flows are to scramble over when cold it is very instructive to watch them when hot 
As the lava cools not only does the surface solidify but the material at the sides does too  As soon as the flow becomes established in fact piles of solid lumps of lava build up at the sides of the flow and help to confine it to its course 
These marginal banks rapidly build up and the lava soon finds itself channelled into a sort of self-made canal  Often the initial rapid rate of flow decreases and then the level of the lava in the canal drops leaving the banks or levees as they are called standing up high and dry like walls 
See Fig. 3  If the flow rate should increase for any reason the lava may burst out over the levees flooding out to form a new branch of the main flow and this break out will itself rapidly become established between levees 
Solid lumps of lava also pile up in front of the advancing nose of the lava  In the higher hotter parts the lava continually advances forward over this solid material engulfing it and rolling it up like the tracks on a tank or caterpillar tractor 
In the lower colder parts though there is much more solid material on the surface on the flanks and in front and the lava can no longer simply advance over the top of the mass of its own rubble in front of it  The flow does n't stop though 
From the outside it may look like a static heap of boiler slag but it 's still very much alive and mobile lava is still arriving deep within it and pushing forward  So the nose of the flow is unstable and there is a constant gentle clatter of small lava chunks falling forward 
Every few minutes a large solid mass breaks off and topples forward in a cascade of loose glowing material and comes to rest a few feet from the main mass leaving a fading sullen red glowing scar to mark the place on the flow where it came from  In this way with one small rock fall following another the flow continues to advance very slowly clanking and rattling forward like a shuffling slag heap 
This movement perhaps only a few metres per hour continues until the supply dies away at source and the nose of the flow gradually slows down and stops still and silent  In a matter of hours the surface will be cold enough for geologists sight-seers and small boys to swarm over it without harm apart from singed boots and perhaps bottoms 
Deeper down though the main mass cools down much more slowly so that for weeks afterwards the core of the flow will be red hot with the glow visible from time to time when small collapses take place  The rubble of solid chilled material overlying the hot core naturally tends to insulate it and it does so very efficiently 
There is even one report of a couple of Russian geologists hopping on to the bouldery surface of an aa flow on the slopes of the Klyuchevskaya volcano in Kamchatka while it was still moving  They were carried along on their gently-moving conveyor belt at a speed of about one and a half kilometres an hour while they made determinations of the viscosity of the lava beneath the rubbly crust and eventually hopped off again none the worse for wear 
Features Associated with Basalt Lava Flows  A stream of lava is a long and complicated object and a great many things can happen to it depending on its own physical condition and the sort of ground it is moving over 
For example a basalt flow which is moving over a dry sandy surface is quite well-behaved and peaceful but if the same flow were to advance on to an area of wet boggy ground or on to a snow-field the water trapped beneath the lava may be heated up and turned into high-pressure steam  This steam sometimes blasts its way up to the surface through the lava causing what is known as a phreatic explosion so the advance of the lava is then anything but peaceful and unwary spectators are sometimes injured by the explosions 
Processes such as these produce a great range of minor surface structures and other curiosities but unfortunately there is only space here to mention one or two of them  Lava tunnels result from the rapid cooling of the surface and side of a flow 
If the flow is a big one this usually means that the flow has an outer layer of rubbly fragments an intermediate layer of solid hard lava and a core which is still molten  This core of lava may continue to flow for a long while but when the supply of fresh lava slows down at source there will not be enough coming through to fill the whole volume of the core so an empty space will be left and this will form a long tube or tunnel running along the centre of the flow sometimes for many kilometres 
See Fig. 4 and see Fig. 5  Such lava tunnels are quite common and they can be most useful 
At one time there was one high up on Etna which served as a convenient overnight refuge for geologists watching activity in the crater  It was at a height of nearly 3,000 metres & the air outside was well below freezing but the lava tunnel was in an area of recent activity and as a result it boasted beautiful underfloor heating 
Near the entrance the temperature was comfortable but further in it rose progressively until it was intolerable  Brewing up was easy all that had to be done was to shift a few boulders to reach a hot spot lower down and pop a billy-can of snow into the hole 
All things have drawbacks however and the sulphurous fumes wafting down from the crater were distinctly smelly and the occupants of the tunnel awoke in the morning with headaches and mouths that tasted like the bottom of a parrot 's cage  Lavas which are fluid enough to produce tunnels also produce a number of other oddities 
Sometimes in the middle of a flow or else at the small mouths or boccas from which the flows emerge gas venting from the lava flings small glowing gobbets of it short distances up into the air  These fall back to earth as soft squishy pancakes which pile up closely round the vent soon enclosing it in a kind of chimney or hornito 
These hornitos which are also known rather aptly as driblet cones go on growing as long as there is both gas and lava to feed them and they may reach a height of many metres  The rate of flow of gas blowing off through these vents is often surprisingly fast 
It 's sometimes possible to approach them closely enough to stick a device like an anemometer or wind speed gauge into the gas jet and by doing this supersonic speeds have been recorded  Unfortunately though the gas is often extremely hot probably over 800 degrees C so the instrument that comes out of the jet is often only a sad relic of the instrument that went in 
Sometimes it does n't come out  Submarine Basalt Lava Flows 
It may seem self-evident that submarine lava flows should be different from those formed on land and that their formation should be accompanied by violent interaction between sea water and hot lava  In some cases where large aa lavas flow from land into the sea this is true and great quantities of steam are generated while the lava is broken up into small glassy fragments which pile up in thick heaps at the front of the flow 
A lava flow originating on land can advance considerable distances into the sea in this way building up a kind of delta of fragmental material on to which the flow proper can advance  Surprisingly though small pahoehoe lavas can pour into the sea with as little disturbance as cream poured into coffee there is a little steam but little else 
This unexpected situation seems to arise because when the molten lava enters the water a layer of steam bubbles forms around it immediately and this forms an effective insulating blanket so that no violent interaction is possible  The same is true of lava flows which are actually extruded under water 
These are common enough since as has already been mentioned a large proportion of the world 's volcanoes are situated in or below the oceans  Unfortunately it is not easy for obvious reasons to study modern submarine lava flows in their proper environment 
The most convenient way to study flows of this sort is to look at old examples which have been brought up above sea level by earth movements of one kind or another and which have been subsequently cut through by erosion and exposed in clean dry cliff sections  Their appearance in such an exposure is extremely distinctive 
Instead of a single thick unit like a land-based basalt a submarine flow consists of a multitude of little packets of lava commonly about one metre across each with a fine-grained glassy skin and these packets are piled on top of one another sometimes in thicknesses of hundreds of metres or more  These packets are properly called pillows and the lavas pillow lavas 
It is clear that the skin of each pillow must originally have been fairly flexible since the base of each pillow characteristically sags into the gap between the ones below it  For many years there was much debate about how pillow lavas formed 
One idea was that they roll downslope from the submarine volcanic vent like plastic bags full of water before piling up on top of one another another was that they whizzed along the sea bed supported by a cushion of collapsing steam bubbles while a third suggested that pillows are n't separate entities at all but long worm-like tubes whose thickness varies along their length  It also used to be thought that pillow lavas could form only at great depths below the surface 
In the last few years our understanding of pillow lavas has advanced dramatically due almost entirely to some remarkable observations made by diver-geologists of pillow lavas actually in the process of formation in the sea off Hawaii  In some of the most outstanding film sequences of volcanic activity ever made the divers were able to demonstrate to the world exactly how pillows are born 
Their film shows the steep underwater flow front of a lava flow which was being erupted from a vent on Hawaii itself  The flow front appears as a mass of rounded pillows disappearing into the blue haze of the Pacific all appears to be motionless 
Suddenly the camera picks out a rounded tongue of hot lava being extruded from the flow front there is a brief flash of red almost immediately extinguished and a new pillow has been created  The flow advances in a manner similar to that of pahoehoe flows on dry land and the pillows are budded off so quietly that the cameramen were able to swim up to within less than a metre of the swelling pillows 
The only hazards in fact lay in the presence of pockets of scalding water and in the possibility of a newly-formed pillow becoming detached from the steep flow front and rolling down on top of them  Their unmistakable appearance coupled with the fact that they always form under water makes pillow lavas very useful in interpreting the volcanic history of geologically old rocks 
Pillow lavas have been identified in some of the oldest rocks on earth over 3,400 million years old and in rocks of all ages up to the present  Wherever one finds pillow lavas in sequences of old rocks one can be sure that they formed under water in the same way as their modern counterparts and this amongst other things helps to establish the sites of ancient oceanic volcanoes and mid-ocean ridges 
Andesite Lava Flows  Describing natural phenomena under separate headings always has the unwelcome implication that they can be considered as separate entities each in its own water-tight compartment 
There is no hard-and-fast difference between basalts and andesites there is a broad transitional group of rocks between them known as basaltic andesites just as there is a similar transitional group between andesites and the next group of rocks to be described the rhyolites  So the discussion of these three groups will necessarily be in general terms 
The first generalization that can be made is that andesite lavas are more viscous than basalt ones  This difference is primarily an effect of the composition of the lava but to a certain extent it may also be the result of the high proportion of phenocrysts present in the lava 
A typical basalt contains a few per cent of phenocryst minerals but in an andesite phenocrysts may form as much as 50 per cent volume of the rock  Such lavas resemble raspberry jam that is half pips or is it wood shavings they use they are not so much liquids as pasty mushes of solid material 
In an andesite the phenocrysts may be up to a centimetre across the groundmass or jam is extremely fine-grained and is often glassy even in the centres of flows  Basalts because of their low viscosity tend to form low thin flows which spread out over large areas and are rarely more than thirty metres thick 
Andesites by contrast form massive flows which may be anything up to 500 metres thick  Some andesite lavas reach staggering proportions the largest yet described in northern Chile has a volume of no less than twenty-four cubic kilometres 
If this flow could be transported to North Wales it would stand half as high as Snowdon if it could be transported to Surrey it would be half as high again as the highest hill and such is the attraction of all high objects from mountains to the cost of living it would be an important landmark regularly thronged in summer with picnickers and ramblers and would feature on scores of postcards  Basalts can also form large volume flows in some cases exceeding twenty-four cubic kilometres but because they are so much thinner they are not so conspicuous and do n't attract attention 
Another consequence of the greater viscosity of andesite lavas is that they flow more slowly  A basalt flow can advance over a kilometre of flat ground in a matter of hours an andesite may take months 
Similarly andesite flows show none of the obvious surface features of liquid lavas pahoehoe flows never occur and all andesite flows have a rough bouldery surface  This is often not quite so unpleasant as an aa flow to move across instead of loose angular cindery material the surface consists of big angular smooth-sided blocks of solid lava much more agreeable to touch and walk over 
This kind of flow is called block lava  The blocks are produced because andesite lavas are so viscous that they flow as plastic rather than liquid materials and consist of an outer chilled surface of solid rock with a steady progression towards increasing plasticity in the hotter central parts of the flow 
Because the outer layer is hard and brittle any heaving or shifting of the more mobile material deeper down will cause it to break up providing the clean sharply-defined angular blocks which cover the surface of the flow  Sometimes quite large solid blocks break off from the flow with the same kind of clean fracture and then since they are still very hot continue to flow slightly 
This emphasizes the vital point that in geology a solid is only a solid if you think of it on a short enough time-scale  In many respects rocks are like pitch which flows like a liquid if it is left unsupported for long enough for example on a steeply-sloping roof but will also break suddenly along clean shiny fracture surfaces if it is given a sharp blow 
It was mentioned in chapter one that the rocks making up the Earth 's mantle show the same kind of behaviour on a short time-scale they are rigid solid enough to transmit shock waves from earthquakes but on a much longer time-scale they can flow and accommodate the convection movements which are believed to provide the driving mechanisms behind Plate Tectonics  The viscous nature of andesite lavas has some interesting side effects especially in those which approach rhyolites in composition that is they contain more silica than an average andesite 
These rocks called dacites are often so viscous that they scarcely flow at all and merely heave themselves sluggishly to the surface to form an irregularly flat-topped mound over the vent  These mounds are not really lava flows at all they are the lava domes sometimes also called tholoids that were mentioned earlier in connection with the eruption of nuees ardentes and the destruction of St Pierre 
Lava domes form remarkably slowly  The dome of Santiaguito in Guatemala has been growing ever since 1922 and was still growing at the time of writing 
In a case like this it 's clear that an extremely viscous semi-solid lava is being slowly and continuously forced upwards through the vent as it does so it cools and thus the dome grows effectively by the addition of material from within  In the case of Santiaguito there is little evidence that the dome is actually growing at all one can sit and watch it for hours without seeing anything more than a few wisps of steam from the top and it 's quite safe to scramble all over it 
Material is continually arriving deep within the mass of dead-looking rock however and the pressure of this imperceptibly forces up spines of solid lava which rise in jagged battlements along the crest of the dome  It 's impossible to see these spines growing but easy to record their growth with a series of photographs taken from the same place over the course of a couple of months 
So domes do n't sound particularly exciting things  But as they continue to build up and up with spines getting higher and higher the time comes when large portions of the mass become mechanically unstable and break away collapsing in a clattering roaring avalanche 
Usually these are ordinary cold avalanches such as one finds on any mountain but if the collapse is a big one and it exposes hot rock deep within the dome a nuee ardente may be produced  So dome-watching is not so dull after all 
Santiaguito which was a complex of four distinct domes joined on to one another in a single elongate ridge is rarely quiet for long and one can literally hear it growing because there is an almost continual rattle of small stones and rocks falling from the higher parts down on to the scree slopes below it  Even when the tholoid is shrouded in mist and invisible as it often is in the afternoon the dry clattering continues with every now and then a much larger collapse taking place 
These start off usually with a thin gentle slithering sound of sliding boulders on the scree slope which abruptly gives way to a much louder roaring collapse as the main mass of rock falls away and hurtles downhill and then afterwards minor falls continue intermittently for long periods  Sometimes a single boulder bounds and clatters down the scree pile echoing loudly sometimes a larger mass breaks away sometimes the scree itself shifts and readjusts itself in a prolonged rattling clatter a noise rather like the sea swashing back over pebbles 
Domes like Santiaguito often develop within the crater walls of an older volcano Santiaguito itself is nested inside a large crater on the flanks of a volcano called Santa Maria  The crater was formed by a powerful eruption in 1902 the same year as the eruption of Mt Pelee 
That eruption also involved the growth of a lava dome in the Etang Sec and it was from this dome that the great spine of Mt Pelee was forced up  Such spines are a common feature of lava domes in fact they are an almost predictable result of the squeezing of viscous lava into a pile of loose broken rocks 
The Mt Pelee spine was exceptional only for its extreme height over 300 metres  In every other respect it was typical of its kind and like most spines it was short lived as it cooled it cracked and started to break up while the heaving of fresh pulses of lava in the dome below rapidly caused what was left to collapse 
Within a few months of reaching its greatest height nothing remained of it but a heap of rubble  Sometimes a mass of viscous lava gets intruded near the surface but does n't actually manage to break through instead it forces up the surface of the ground on top forming a considerable hill where there was no hill before 
This has happened twice in the crater of the Usu volcano in Japan the first time in 1910 the second in 1943  The first upheaval produced a hill which was called Sin-Zan or Roof Mountain the second logically enough was called Showa Sin-Zan or New Roof Mountain 
Showa Sin-Zan grew during the height of the Second World War so that there were no official records of its growth but a particularly astute village postmaster Masao Mimatsu kept a valuable pictorial record of its progress by drawing a series of profile sketches on the paper covering of his window  See Fig. 1 
This is what happened  After a long series of preliminary earthquakes a circular area of ground began to rise slowly and steadily in January 1944 by April the area affected was three kilometres across and had gone up fifteen metres by June it had gone up fifty metres and had taken the village of Fukaba and all its inhabitants with it 
Some fairly violent explosive activity then followed forcing the people of Fukaba to leave their homes but still no new lava showed its head above ground  By October the uplifted area was no less than 150 metres above its surroundings but still no lava had broken through the cover of soil and rocks 
Eventually in November 1944 a plug of incandescent lava poked up through the middle of the elevated dome and this gradually rose during the course of the next year until it was over a hundred metres above the top of the dome and nearly 300 metres above normal ground level  The odd thing about this new lava plug is that it went straight up like a piston in a cylinder wearing on top a thick cap of mud and clay which had originally been deposited in a crater lake and had formed the ground surface prior to all the upheaval 
Apart from being baked hard by the heat of the lava these sediments were quite undisturbed and had been carried bodily as smoothly as if they had gone up in a lift  Rhyolite Lava Flows 
Lavas become scarcer amongst rocks of more acid compositions and rhyolites are much less abundant than andesites They are highly viscous never flowing far from their source and usually merely ooze up from the vent like toothpaste to pile up into short thick flows and domes  Like dacite domes rhyolite domes often form within the crater of a preexisting volcano but they may equally well pop up at the surface as isolated extrusions not visibly related to any volcano 
Obsidian it will be recalled is the black volcanic glass with the composition of rhyolite  Although it is one of the most widely-known volcanic rocks obsidian lava flows are rare 
In Europe the only flows of any consequence occur on small volcanic islands in the Mediterranean the most famous of all being those on the island of Lipari which are thought to have been erupted about 1,400 years ago  Even better-known are a pair which were erupted about 1,000 years ago in Sisikyou County California 
These two formed a massive pile hundreds of metres thick which the Americans in their inimitable way call Glass Mountain  A mountain of glass it certainly is 
From the air it looks exactly as if someone had poured a couple of bucketsful of molten glass on to the surface forming a puddle which slowly oozed away  The flows are covered with large high wrinkles and ridges concentric with the edges of the flow where the stiff surface layer was crinkled up by the pressure of more material arriving from behind rather like a pahoehoe surface on a basalt lava but on a much bigger scale 
Obsidian itself is splendid stuff  The best material is jet black pure glass free from bubbles or other imperfections 
It shatters satisfyingly when hammered and it does so in a characteristic way  There are any number of razor-sharp splinters and jagged irregular surfaces of course but some fragments usually show what is called a conchoidal fracture the surface is fairly smooth but ridged with a number of concentric corrugations centred on the point of impact of the hammer and the effect produced is somewhat reminiscent of the appearance of the ridges on a cockle shell 
Unlike most volcanic rocks obsidian does not contain phenocrysts it is so to speak all glassy groundmass  Glasses are not particularly stable materials and in the course of time they devitrify acquiring a micro-crystalline structure and losing their glassy transparency 
In some cases devitrification begins at centres scattered regularly throughout the whole mass and this can produce very attractive effects  Some obsidians such as those from the Yellowstone National Park have white spots about a centimetre across scattered liberally throughout the black glass 
This is called snowflake obsidian and is something of a collector 's item  In most glassy lavas bands of devitrified glass and layers of frothy bubbly glass are interleaved with layers of unaltered material 
When this happens one can see clearly displayed just the convulsions and contortions the lava goes through as it flows the bands are tightly folded in tortuous patterns  These folded patterns are characteristic of flow in all kinds of media one can see similar folds in glaciers in some kinds of metamorphic rock which have been heated strongly and whenever immiscible liquids become intermingled 
The iridescent films of oil on top of puddles provide perhaps the best analogies  If such a puddle is stirred gently the swirling winding folds produced look exactly like those in obsidian lavas 
Few obsidian lavas consist of obsidian all the way through  In general the obsidian forms only on the outer skin of the lava which is rapidly chilled while the central parts of the flow which remain hot for a long while consist of rhyolite 
Rhyolites are pale grey or buff-coloured rocks with a micro-crystalline structure and a rather distinctive sugary texture or feel like obsidian they usually have a well-developed banding running through them which shows up the flow folds in the lava plainly  by no means all rhyolite lavas are associated with obsidian the majority are not and as one goes further back through the geological record obsidian becomes progressively more and more scarce due to devitrification and none at all is found in rocks more than a few million years old 
A Plate Tectonic Re-cap  Rather a lot has been said in this chapter about the minor details of lava flows 
It 's important however not to lose sight of the bigger issues  All the differences that have been discussed between basalts andesites and rhyolites fundamentally reflect their differences in composition and this in turn is a function of the geological environment in which the lavas occur 
Basalts are the rocks which are formed at mid-ocean ridges and which make up the entire oceanic crust  Some basalts do occur in continental areas notably the basaltic flood plateaux mentioned in chapter three but to see an eruption of basaltic lava taking place one would have to fly at short notice to an oceanic island volcano such as Iceland 
On Iceland one might if one were lucky also find small quantities of andesitic and rhyolitic rocks being erupted but they are scarce since they can only be formed by skimming off silica-rich material from a large volume of basaltic magma in the same way as cream is skimmed off the top of milk  Andesite lavas are characteristic of destructive plate margins where the rocks of the oceanic crust are diving down beneath a continental plate 
The Andes is obviously a good place to go looking for an eruption of an andesite lava but one would be extremely lucky to find one because although there are numerous active volcanoes along the Andean chain andesite eruptions are really rather rare events compared to basaltic ones  Destructive plate margins tend to produce a greater variety of lavas than constructive ones and in some cases basaltic and andesitic rocks are found together 
Although rhyolite lavas do not occur in large volumes anywhere in the world they are much more characteristic of destructive plate margins than constructive ones  They are rare because since they are so highly viscous rhyolite magmas are involved in more explosive eruptions than either basalts or andesites and therefore are usually erupted as pyroclastic rocks rather than lavas 
Which brings us on nicely to a discussion of pyroclastic rocks themselves  Volcanic Rocks Pyroclastic Fall Deposits 
Pumice is much the best-known of all pyroclastic or fire-broken rocks but it is only one of many types which are ejected from volcanoes as solid fragmentary material  This chapter will be concerned with the most straightforward kinds of pyroclastic deposits those which are made up of fragments which have simply been shot up into the air and fallen back down again so they are known as pyroclastic fall deposits 
The following chapter will be devoted to an examination of the rocks produced by nuees ardentes and similar phenomena these travel over the surface of the ground as pyroclastic flows and are very different  A shorter word for pyroclastic fall deposits is tephra 
Tephra comprises all the solid fragmental matter ejected by all types of volcano and covers all rock compositions from basic to acid  The tephra in any one place may include a wide range of different-sized fragments and a simple set of terms is used to distinguish between these 
Ashes are particles less than four millimetres across  Lapilli Italian little stones are between four and thirty-two millimetres across 
Bombs and blocks are lumps bigger than thirty-two millimetres across  Thus while newspaper accounts and other sources including this one often talk rather loosely about volcanic ashes during an eruption a vulcanologist properly restricts this term only to the smallest particles 
Tephra are often erupted extremely rapidly  During its 1947 eruption the Icelandic volcano Hekla ejected ash at a rate estimated to be nearly 100,000 cubic metres per second during the first half hour slowing down subsequently to a more modest 30,000 cubic metres per second 
Rapid production of such large amounts of material clearly has profound effects on the land round the volcano  In the immediate vicinity of the vent ashes and lapilli pile up to form a mantle many metres thick which blankets the countryside like a dirty snow fall like a snow fall too the ash tends to smooth out the earlier irregularities of the ground surface ultimately producing a landscape of soft gently moulded hillocks and hollows 
Such carpets of ash sometimes cover thousands of square kilometres but they need not be particularly extensive to be damaging  The town of Heimaey in Iceland was buried under basaltic tephra in a matter of days after the commencement of the eruption of the volcano Helgafell in 1973 
During the space of a few hours a one-metre thickness of ash accumulated in some parts of the town which were only a few hundred metres away from the active vent and many house roofs collapsed under the weight  In other parts of the town a kilometre or more from the vent the ash fall was thinner and damage proportionally less 
Since there is such a wide difference between the least violent types of eruption Hawaiian and the most violent Plinian it is scarcely surprising that there is an equally wide difference between the kinds of pyroclastic rocks produced by each  Recent work has shown that the types of deposit produced by different kinds of eruption can be recognized by objective criteria such as the total volume of material erupted the distance that it travels from the vent the degree of fragmentation and the range of particle sizes present at any point 
The details of this analysis of pyroclastic deposits are rather complex so only a few of the more interesting aspects will be described here  Hawaiian Eruptions 
One consequence of the extremely fluid nature of the lavas erupted in Hawaiian eruptions especially those of the Hawaiian volcanoes themselves is that they are sometimes so fluid that when fire fountains are spraying lava upwards some of the liquid sets solid into teardrop shapes with bulbous ends and long-drawn-out tails  They are made of basaltic glass so when they come to rest they glisten blackly on the ground 
See Fig. 1  The Hawaiian islanders have their own name for these glassy droplets they call them Pele 's tears after the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes Pele 
Not to be confused with the volcano Pelee in the Caribbean  It has been suggested that the term achnelith Greek spray stones should be used to describe pyroclastic particles which originated from lavas so fluid that they owe their shape more to the effects of surface tension than any other cause 
If a piece of ordinary glass is heated over a gas flame it softens easily and eventually the heated part will gather itself into a drop and fall to the ground  It does n't detach itself completely though as it falls it draws out behind it a thin flexible thread of glass which seems to stretch almost indefinitely 
The same thing happens with Pele 's tears they draw off behind them a long hair-like tail of glass which may be a metre or more long  If the hair should snap off from the tear it may drift for many kilometres on the wind falling slowly and come to rest a long way down-wind from the vent 
The finest of these thin threads of glass are extremely soft and flexible and are a light golden brown in colour  Little wonder then that they are known as Pele 's hair 
There are even reports that this hair is gathered by the more discriminating kinds of birds to build their nests  When less fluid lavas are involved which do n't break up into droplets large gobbets of the molten rock are flung up from the vent spreading out into irregular plates which may break up in the air into smaller bits 
As they trace their lazy parabolas back down to earth these bits twist around slowly over and over until they hit the ground with a flop or a flump splodging out to form round flattish masses  When cool these splodges look like the brown steaming splodges observed near cows on pastureland so they are known as cow-pats 
The individual cow-pats are often still very hot and plastic when they hit the ground so that as they pile up one on top of each other they spread out further and weld together forming a solid mass known as spatter  A spatter cone or spatter ring consisting exclusively of welded cow-pats often builds up around the vent 
These spatter cones contain little if any fine-grained ashy material and are amongst the most characteristic products of Hawaiian eruptions  Strombolian Eruptions 
The most abundant basaltic pyroclastic material is variously termed ash clinker cinders or slag depending on local preference  These terms are all very descriptive since the material which accumulates around a Strombolian vent does indeed look rather like boiler slag but it is more correctly called scoria and the cones which build up around the vent scoria cones 
The scoria from a typical Strombolian eruption consists of loose rubbly material with a wide range in size of the constituent fragments but with only a small proportion less than about one millimetre in size  The fragments themselves characteristically have a light frothy texture the lava being honeycombed with large numbers of gas bubbles or vesicles 
Normally basaltic scoria is a drab grey colour but sometimes when it is fresh the surface may be beautifully iridescent shining in peacock blue colours  Quite often also hot steam blasting through a scoria cone may oxidize or rust the iron in the rock giving the scoria a deep reddish-brown colour 
Scoria cones are themselves distinctive objects  They are rarely more than a couple of hundred metres high and they are usually symmetrical although they may be breached on one side where a lava flow has emerged 
Their most characteristic feature though is that the angle of slope of the sides of the cone is always that of the angle of rest for loose scoria which means that all young scoria cones have side slopes of 33 degrees  See Fig. 2 
Naturally this crisp geometrical profile becomes softened and less perceptible as scoria cones grow older and are subjected to the normal processes of erosion  Many of the fragments which go to make up a scoria cone are individually big enough to be called blocks or bombs according to the simple size classification 
But how does one differentiate between a block and a bomb  It has been suggested that a bomb be simply defined as an ejected block with a shape sufficiently interesting to attract attention 
While this is not a particularly scientific definition it is perfectly adequate and the term bomb is in common use in vulcanology although this is perhaps unfortunate since it may suggest to the reader some unpleasant kind of projectile which explodes on impact  This is not the case 
Volcanic bombs are just lumps of solid or sometimes plastic lava which are lobbed out of the vent fall back to earth with a wallop and that 's all  The biggest bombs though land with a considerable wallop and are quite as unpleasant to be standing beneath as any military weapon and they can be a good deal larger 
Cotopaxi in Ecuador is reported to have lobbed a 200-ton bomb over fourteen kilometres but this seems a little difficult to swallow  Macdonald however has described a well-documented case of an eight-ton bomb being hurled nearly one kilometre by an explosion in the crater of Halemaumau Hawaii in 1924 and there are many other equally impressive accounts 
Such large bombs are rather exceptional though most are well under a metre across and do n't travel more than a few tens of metres from the vent  There are a number of different kinds of bomb some of them known by a variety of colourful synonyms but in many cases there is a good deal of argument about exactly how they acquire their shape 
Some are undoubtedly produced when ropy strands or shreds of sticky lava are flung up out of the vent twisting and turning slightly in the air before falling back to earth these are known as rope or ribbon bombs and they may be as much as one metre long  When a bigger more compact lump of lava is ejected it commonly happens that the outermost skin of plastic lava tends to be pushed backwards towards the trailing edge of the bomb by the rush of air passing it 
If the bomb also twists or spins at all the skin gets drawn into a tail forming a spindle bomb  Ribbon and spindle bombs both owe their shapes to events taking place within and above the volcanic vents but other shaping processes also operate 
Bombs made from plastic lavas tend to remain where they fall but denser more solid bombs sometimes bounce off the sides of the scoria cone at a glancing angle and acquire a rapid spin  Once spinning they are difficult to stop and they flash down the slopes in a series of great leaps and bounds making a loud whirring noise and travel sometimes for hundreds of metres 
In their headlong rush they naturally tend to get their corners knocked off at each bounce so they end up as peculiarly smooth rounded lumps the smoothness being the result of mechanical abrasion  Such bombs often smash into other bigger stationary boulders at the base of the cone shattering into smithereens but in doing so they leave their own mark on the boulder 
Walking around the base of an active cone erupting these bombs is a bit like walking around a battlefield with spent rounded cannonball bombs and shattered fragments of cannonballs lying around and many big battered boulders exhibiting the bruises of a long volcanic siege  Every few minutes a fresh fusillade of whirring bombs hurtles downwards to smash into the debris below compelling the observer to stop walking idly around and take cover 
Surtseyan Eruptions  In chapter three it was mentioned that the effect of getting large volumes of water mixed up in a volcanic eruption is to make it more violent 
Not surprisingly one result of this is that the pyroclastic material erupted in a Surtseyan eruption is much more highly fragmented than that in a similar basaltic eruption taking place on land and this in turn means that the deposits produced contain a much greater proportion of very small particles than their Strombolian counterparts  This does n't mean that there are no large fragments present there are merely less of them 
A second consequence of the more explosive nature of a Surtseyan eruption is that the pyroclastic material gets scattered much more widely  This means that a typical Surtseyan cone has a different profile from a Strombolian one 
Put side by side the differences are obvious  See Fig. 3 
These low broad cones are called ash rings  They are quite unmistakable and are often very elegant indeed especially when they are perfectly circular and symmetrical 
Ash rings are characteristic of submarine eruptions but they are by no means confined to marine environments  They can be formed on land near the sea in shallow lakes or indeed anywhere where it is possible for a large volume of water to find its way into the volcanic vent 
Vulcanian Eruptions  The deposits produced by Vulcanian eruptions are similar to those produced by Surtseyan eruptions in that they too consist of highly-fragmented material with a large proportion of it less than one millimetre in size 
The principal difference between the two is that Vulcanian deposits consist of non-vesiculated material  Each fragment is a small dense angular piece of lava quite unlike the frothy vesiculated basaltic material that is characteristic of both Strombolian and Surtseyan deposits 
Probably the best known Vulcanian deposit is one produced by an eruption of Vulcano itself in the 1880s  This deposit mantles the flanks of the pre-existing cone but is no more than a few metres thick at most 
Littering the slopes of the volcano are thousands of large bombs ejected by the eruption some of them over a metre in diameter  The most intriguing of these are bread crust bombs which are rounded or angular lumps with a smooth glassy crust broken up by deep cracks and fissures which expose the frothy vesicular core of the bomb so that it looks rather like a well-baked crusty loaf 
These bombs were produced when lumps of viscous gas-rich lava were ejected from the vent the outer surface of the lump chilled quickly forming the glassy crust but the inside remained hot and the gas trapped within it continued to come out of solution and to expand forming a spongy mass of vesicles  This internal expansion caused the outer skin to crack open forming the diagnostic crusty-looking surface 
The pumice deposits produced by Vesuvian sub-Plinian and Plinian eruptions are much the most interesting of all pyroclastic rocks so they will be discussed in a little more detail  First a word about pumice itself 
The pumice that we know from painful experience in the bathroom consists of material containing over 65 per cent of silica and there is a general tendency to associate pumice only with acid rocks such as rhyolites  Strictly speaking though pumice is only a kind of highly vesicular glassy rock with a low density so low that many types will float on water and it may be anywhere between basalt and rhyolite in composition 
Pumice of basaltic composition however is rather rare although there are some rather peculiar varieties in the Hawaiian Islands  Some of these are the lightest known rocks in the world with apparent densities of only 0â€“3 
Surprisingly these ultra-light pumices sink in water since there is so little basaltic material and so much air space that all the air spaces are interconnected and water can fill the whole mass  Ordinary pumice by contrast shows a wide range in density depending upon the degree of vesiculation that has taken place in the magma but it is still nothing more than a solidified rock froth 
The vesicles are separated from one another by thin films of glass so that air can be trapped inside enabling the pumice to float  Sometimes when a volcano erupts in the sea massive carpets of floating pumice accumulate on the sea around it and may drift a long way from it 
These have occasionally given rise to strange sea-farers ' tales of floating islands  These islands are rapidly broken up by wind and waves but the pumice fragments may be carried thousands of kilometres to be washed up on some distant coral strand 
No pumice will float indefinitely though  After a period of months water finds its way into even the innermost air spaces and the pumice becomes waterlogged and finally sinks 
All air-fall pumice deposits originate in the same way in Vesuvian or Plinian gas-blast eruptions which throw up dense clouds of ash tens of thousands of metres into the air  The violence of the eruption and the lightness of the pumice fragments means that they will go higher and stay air-borne longer than any other kind of pyroclastic material and it is this that gives pumice deposits their unique properties 
Around the volcanic vent itself a jumbled mass of highly irregular pumice fragments most of them very large piles up to form a conical heap round the vent  Unlike a scoria cone though a pumice cone is usually rather low and poorly defined and sometimes does not even have a recognizable crater 
In a Plinian eruption it 's usually impossible to pin down the site of the vent exactly since it stands a high chance of being obliterated or destroyed by the eruption itself  Pumice deposits in fact are usually much better preserved and more informative when one sees them at points some way from the vent 
As one goes away from the vent two effects become apparent  First the thickness of the deposit steadily diminishes one which is ten metres thick close to the vent may be only twenty centimetres or so thick at twenty kilometres ' distance 
The thickness does not decrease linearly but follows an exponential curve with the thickness decreasing much more over the first kilometre than the second and so on  See Fig. 1 
Second and also predictably the average size of the fragments present at any one point also decreases with distance from the vent  See Fig. 2 
Perhaps the most interesting property of all though is that the range of sizes present at any one point in an air-fall pumice deposit is rather restricted so that the fragments tend to be all more or less the same size or to put it formally the deposit is said to be well-sorted  This point can best be illustrated with a couple of size-frequency graphs 
See Fig. 3  A badly-sorted deposit gives a low broad curve whereas a well sorted deposit which has exactly the same range of fragment sizes gives a single very well-defined peak 
This kind of peaked size-frequency distribution is thoroughly typical of air-fall pumice deposits so how does it come about  It 's all to do with what happens to the fragments of pumice while they are in mid-air suspended in the ash cloud above the volcano 
Within the cloud itself violent currents are at play sweeping round and round in tight convulsive cells just as in a thundercloud  These currents keep all the ash thoroughly mixed up but inevitably as the ash cloud drifts away down-wind the heavier particles tend to fall out leaving the finer ones behind them 
This does n't contradict Galileo 's famous observations on the speeds of falling bodies the pumice fragments are so light that their aerodynamic properties rather than their weight control their rate of fall  The larger particles naturally fall out nearer the vent the smaller ones fall more slowly and are dispersed by the wind 
The finest material may be carried for tens of kilometres down-wind and some of it may even stay suspended for many months eventually falling back to earth on the other side of the globe  The process is a bit like winnowing the old method of using the wind to separate wheat from chaff except that in the case of pyroclastic material there is no simple division into light material husks and heavy grain but a continuous gradation in sizes and therefore weight of particles from fine to coarse 
So it is a wind-winnowing process that is responsible for the well sorted distribution of grain sizes that is characteristic of air-fall deposits  The same process operates throughout the size spectrum 
This latter is quite an important point because although it may not be immediately obvious a deposit which consists only of large particles can be just as well-sorted as one which consists only of small ones  A case which illustrates some of these features well is the ash erupted by the Chilean volcano Quizapu during a Plinian eruption in 1932 
The ash cloud reached over 15,000 metres in height and was carried by the prevailing winds to the north-east into Argentina  Ash began to fall on Buenos Aires seventeen hours after the eruption had started on Quizapu 1,120 kilometres away 
The ash-fall was thick enough to darken the sky and about half a centimetre accumulated on the ground  A few days later ash from the same eruption had reached Rio de Janeiro 2,960 kilometres away but here the fall was very scanty indeed not thick enough to form a measurable deposit and consisted only of the finest dust-like particles 
The ash cloud drifted at somewhere between twenty-five and sixty kilometres per hour and it covered in all more than two million square kilometres of the South American continent  See Fig. 4 
Isopach Maps  Because they have been an important part of some historic eruptions a few pumice deposits are well-documented but surprisingly few have been studied closely from a geological viewpoint 
This situation is changing though and some interesting things are now being done with pumice deposits  One of the simplest and most informative things to do is to measure the thickness of the pumice deposit at as many places as possible plot these thicknesses on a map and then draw lines on the map rather like contour lines linking points of equal ash thickness say ten metres five metres one metre and so on 
These lines look a bit like the isobars on a weather map but the lines are isopachs and the map an isopach map  Bear in mind that pachydermal = thick skinned 
See Fig. 5  These maps are useful in a number of ways 
It 's immediately obvious how the thickness of the deposit varies away from the vent and it 's also possible to work out fairly rapidly the total volume of ash erupted  Less important these maps show up clearly the direction of the wind at the time of the eruption since the isopachs are all elongated downwind 
To digress for a moment it 's a curious fact that most isopach maps for pumice deposits reveal winds blowing generally in an easterly direction the ash deposits are all concentrated to the east of the volcano  Partly this may be due to the fact that outside the tropics atmospheric circulation is from west to east due to Coriolis forces the forces which result from the effect of the Earth 's rotation on moving bodies 
In areas where there are a number of pumice deposits present all of them looking much the same it 's clearly a difficult job to tell them apart and more important to recognize the same individual deposits in separate localities which may be many kilometres apart  Much slow and painstaking geological detective work is needed to make correlations such as these but the results can be very valuable 
The use of successive pumice or ash deposits in building up a history of the eruptive activity in an area is known as tephrachronology and this is increasingly being used to add precision to the study of the history of volcanic areas  Not only does tephrachronology enable a far-flung ash to be uniquely identified but if the ash can be independently dated at any single locality by isotopic methods then it provides a firm foundation on which to build the history of a volcano 
On the academic site detailed tephrachronology makes it possible to study patterns in the behaviour of volcanoes the magma erupted from one volcano may become steadily more acid or it may show cyclical changes or it may even vary consistently during each eruption starting off fairly basic and ending up at the close of the eruption much more acid  Evidence of this sort can provide clues to the history and origin of the magmas themselves and of the processes which are acting deep below the volcano 
Turning briefly to Plate Tectonics studies of pyroclastic deposits can contribute much useful information  It is easy enough to measure the volumes of lava flows but it is only by constructing isopach maps that the volume of pyroclastic material erupted can be estimated and this is particularly important in volcanoes at destructive plate margins where the mass of magma represented by pyroclastic rocks sometimes far outweighs that represented by lavas 
This is a point that has been commonly overlooked in the past even by geologists since there is a general tendency to assume that the only rocks worth bothering about are hard rocks which can be hit with a hammer  The ratio of the proportions of lavas and pyroclastic rocks in any area is of some intrinsic interest but the total rate at which new pyroclastic rocks and lavas are erupted at destructive plate margins is of more fundamental significance 
Although oceanic crust is consumed at destructive plate margins at very nearly the same rate at which it is created at constructive plate margins a small proportion of mantle material perhaps only a few per cent is involved in the generation of andesite magmas at destructive plate margins and contributes to the volcanic rocks erupted at the surface  The effect of this is that there is a slow but steady conversion of mantle material into continental crust and therefore a steady net increase in the volume of continental crust 
It 's been estimated that this might be of the order of one cubic kilometre per year  This in turn means that over the course of geological time the continents have been and are getting steadily bigger do n't worry though the extra real-estate coming on to the market wo n't make mortgages any easier to get

The Future  Dr Paul Pacy qualified from St George 's Hospital London in 1976 
He moved to Birmingham for his early clinical experience and to research on aspects of hypertension in diabetes which formed his MD thesis  He is now pursuing his clinical and research interests in diabetes and metabolism at the Clinical Research Centre Harrow 
Epidemiological studies mainly in the non-diabetic have demonstrated that hypertension is one of several major risk factors for atherosclerosis Keys 1975 Miller et al 1981  Since the widespread use of insulin therapy during the 1920s macrovascular disease has become the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic subject in both the UK and USA Entmacher et al 1964 Marble 1976 Tunbridge 1981 
Any attempt to improve the prognosis of diabetics must address this central observation  This chapter will attempt to delineate the relationship between hypertension and diabetes with specific reference to prevalence effect on prognosis pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment 
It is often claimed that hypertension is prevalent in diabetic subjects Christlieb 1982 although the evidence for such a statement is conflicting and by no means universally accepted  An association between hypertension and diabetes has been suspected for over 70 years 
As early as 1907 it was reported that there was a frequent association between hyperglycaemia hypertension atherosclerosis and obesity Elliott 1907  Several years later it was observed that 39 per cent of 500 diabetic patients had systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg Kramer 1928 and in the same year another study showed that hypertension was almost three times more common in diabetics than non-diabetics Bell & Clawson 1928 
By the end of the 1920s the majority of published work suggested that hypertension was more prevalent in diabetics Major 1929 however such a view was by no means unanimous  John 1932 found that hypertension was only more prevalent in diabetics who were over 40 years of age while another study failed to confirm an excess prevalence Sherrill 1933 
However numerous methodological problems arising in these papers make comparison of the results extremely difficult  These problems include failure to standardise the definition of hypertension and diabetes the use of either IV or V Korotkoff phases for diastolic blood pressure and a failure to take account of obesity or differentiate between the types of diabetes 
More recent studies have managed to overcome several of these problems  Pell & D'Alonzo reported that hypertension was more frequent in diabetics at 37 per cent prevalence compared to matched non-diabetics at 24 per cent employed at the Dupont Electric Company Pell & D'Alonzo 1967 
They also demonstrated that such differences in hypertension were present in the prediabetic state  In contrast a large clinic-based survey failed to show similar findings and the authors felt that hypertension was no more common in diabetics than non-diabetics Keen et al 1975 
Several large population-based surveys have confirmed that the blood pressure in diabetics is higher than in non-diabetics Ostrander et al 1965 Kannel & McGee 1979 the difference being more marked in females  In addition two recent American studies one from a diabetic clinic population Christlieb et al 1981 the other a community-based study in elderly subjects Barrett-Connor et al 1981 appeared to confirm the excess frequency of hypertension in diabetes 
Importantly in the community-based study the higher level of systolic blood pressure in diabetic subjects persisted even after correcting for obesity although the relationship was not as strong  Several large population surveys have shown an independent relationship between blood glucose and blood pressure with ethnic differences between whites and blacks also apparent Dunn et al 1970 Sive et al 1971 
The prevalence of hypertension is significantly greater in non-diabetic blacks than whites Comstock 1957 Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Co-operative Group 1977 and similar findings have been confirmed in a recent clinic survey of diabetics at a District General Hospital Pacy et al 1985  Forty per cent 203/507 of diabetics under 65 years of age were hypertensive using the current World Health Organisation criteria systolic blood pressure â‰¥ 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure â‰¥ 95 mm Hg World Health Organisation 1979 
Blacks 48.9 per cent had a greater prevalence than whites 37.5 per cent P<0.05 and Asians 35.4 per cent(P<0.05)  Females 49.1 per cent had a greater prevalence than males 33.0 per cent P<0.001 a trend noted for all ethnic groups 
Those not receiving insulin therapy had a greater prevalence 45.6 per cent than those on insulin 30.7 per cent P<0.001 although this relationship was not found in blacks in whom the prevalence of hypertension was similar regardless of the type of diabetic therapy  As in several previous studies isolated systolic hypertension was the commonest finding Epstein et al 1965 Garcia et al 1974 Hawthorne et al 1974 Kannel & McGee 1979 and isolated diastolic hypertension the least common in all ethnic groups 
Multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between age and systolic P<0.00001 and diastolic P<0.00001 blood pressure and a negative relationship between duration of diabetes and diastolic blood pressure  P<0.004 
A control non-diabetic group was not recruited in this study so that it was not possible to determine whether the prevalence of hypertension in diabetics was greater than in non-diabetics  However available data from non-diabetic populations in the age range surveyed in the diabetic clinic study have revealed prevalence rates in both sexes of between 20 and 25 per cent Epstein et al 1965 Garcia et al 1974 Hawthorne et al 1974 Kannel & McGee 1979 which would suggest that in non-insulin-treated diabetics at least hyper-tension is more prevalent than in non-diabetics in all ethnic groups 
Although all these studies have been conducted in adult subjects it appears that higher levels of systolic blood pressure are present in adolescent diabetics compared to non-diabetics both in Europe Florey et al 1976 and the USA Moss 1962  The majority of data indicate that hypertension is prevalent in diabetics and at all ages their systolic blood pressure is probably higher than in non-diabetics 
Evidence of higher levels of diastolic blood pressure at least before middle age is lacking provided there is no evidence of renal impairment  The majority of evidence appears to support the concept that hypertension has an adverse effect on prognosis in the diabetic 
A greater mortality in hypertensive compared to normotensive diabetics was reported in one study but no comparison with non-diabetic hypertensives was made Hayward & Lucena 1965 while a 10-year prospective study of 370 diabetics showed that hypertension was no more hazardous in diabetics than non-diabetics Pell & D'Alonzo 1970  In contrast data from life insurance applicants suggested that for comparable degrees of hypertension the impact on mortality was greater in diabetics and particularly marked in those aged less than 40 years Goodkin 1975 
The Framingham study Kannel & McGee 1979 has revealed that female diabetics have a 4-fold and males a 2-fold increased mortality compared to age- and sex-matched non-diabetics  In addition coronary artery disease cerebrovascular accidents and in particular intermittent claudication occurred more frequently in diabetics of both sexes 
However this study demonstrated that the increased prevalence of macrovascular complications was not accounted for by the increased frequency of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension  Similar findings had previously been reported from the Joslin Clinic in the USA although the specific role of hypertension was not evaluated Kessler 1971 
Evidence of a detrimental effect of hypertension has been derived from the Whitehall male civil servant study Fuller et al 1983  A nonlinear relationship was observed between coronary heart and stroke mortality with the two hour postprandial blood glucose 
Diabetics and those with postprandial blood glucose levels between 5.4â€“11  O mmol/l had increased mortality compared to those with blood glucose <5.4 mmol/l Age and hypertension were most strongly related to coronary heart and stroke mortality within both the diabetic and glucose-intolerant groups 
Therefore it appears that hypertension has an additive deleterious effect on overall prognosis in the diabetic  As in the non-diabetic the hypertension in diabetes can be divided into primary essential and secondary 
Despite numerous secondary conditions i.e. acromegaly Cushing 's and Conn 's syndromes phaeochromocytoma and thyrotoxicosis in which elevated blood pressure is associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism these are probably no more frequent in the diabetic than the non-diabetic hypertensive  Likewise other conditions such as renal artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis which might be expected to occur more frequently in the diabetic appear not to do so Munichoodappa et al 1979 
However renal dysfunction especially in long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes is the exception although whether hypertension is the cause or a result of the nephropathy remains uncertain  Several classifications have been proposed although a modification of that recently advocated Christlieb 1982 appears a practical and useful guide for management Table 3.1 
It is important to subdivide the hypertensive diabetic into insulin-dependent Type 1 or non-insulin-dependent Type 2  Each type may have hypertension with or without evidence of nephropathy 
The form of the elevated blood pressure may be isolated systolic isolated diastolic or a combination of both  Although this basic classification will suffice for the vast majority of hypertensive diabetics it is extremely important to delineate the numerically small percentage of those whose elevated blood pressure is associated with neuropathy as these will present an additional therapeutic challenge 
Table 3.1 Practical classification of hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus  Several authorities have stated that malignant hypertension implying the presence of arterial fibrinoid necrosis and usually a diastolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg with retinal changes such as haemorrhages exudates and papilloedema is rare in diabetics and that generally the degree of hypertension tends not to be severe Drury 1983 
In a recent study the mean systolic blood pressure of hypertensive diabetics n =203 was 174Â±27 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 89Â±14 mm Hg Pacy et al 1985  Similar mean blood-pressure levels were recorded in both those receiving insulin and those on diet with or without oral hypoglycaemic agents demonstrating that hypertension in the diabetic is not particularly severe 
Blood pressure is dependent upon two factors cardiac output and peripheral resistance  However the precise role of these in the diabetic hypertensive is not known 
Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated including premature atherosclerosis increased circulating blood volume a role for insulin body sodium and catecholamines abnormal central blood-pressure regulation and abnormalities of function or structure of plasma renin which will now be reviewed  It is now well established that diabetics are prone to early atherosclerosis Epstein et al 1965 Pirart 1978 Kannel & McGee 1979 which appears no different from that in non-diabetics Robertson & Strong 1968 
When this occurs in the great blood vessels it may result in loss of the normal damping mechanism of the cardiac output due to the relative inelasticity of these vessels  Clinically the reduced compliance in the great vessels will be manifest as an elevation of the systolic blood pressure which is perhaps the reason for its frequent occurrence in the diabetic subject Pacy et al 1985 
In the non-insulin-dependent diabetic it has been postulated that insulin may play a key role in the pathogenesis of elevated blood pressure  It is now established that insulin has an antinatriuretic action resulting in increased sodium reabsorption probably from the proximal convoluted tubules 
It has been shown that only physiological concentrations of insulin c. 30â€“40 Î¼ U/ml are required for such an effect De Fronzo 1981  Many non-insulin-dependent subjects are overweight and are therefore likely to be hyperinsulinaemic as a result of insulin resistance 
This may result in increased sodium reabsorption with subsequent increased exchangeable body sodium De Chatel et al 1977  Indeed increased exchangeable sodium in diabetics has been reported by one group of research workers who also showed that diuretic therapy lowered blood pressure while reversing the 10 per cent increased exchangeable sodium to normal De Chatel et al 1977 Weidmann et al 1979 
Studies using alloxan-induced diabetes in rats Christlieb 1974 and in poorly controlled human diabetics Christlieb et al 1975 have suggested that hyperglycaemia per se may be associated with increased blood volume possibly secondary to an osmotic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia  Such an effect along with the antinatriuretic effect of hyperinsulinaemia expands the extracellular compartment at the expense of intracellular dehydration 
As long as fluid intake remains adequate to compensate for ensuing polyuria the blood volume will remain expanded with resultant elevation of cardiac output and thus blood pressure  A possible pathological role for the renin-angiotensin system has been proposed 
In normotensive and hypertensive diabetics without evidence of nephropathy both raised and normal levels of plasma renin activity have been found Christleib et al 1976 De Chatel et al 1977 Burden & Thursten 1979  Although studies have revealed that only a small subgroup of such diabetics have reduced plasma renin in those with nephropathy both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone tend to be decreased Christlieb 1978 
This may be due to a reduction of free water clearance resulting in elevation of the blood volume and suppression of renin while the osmotic effect of hyperglycaemia may further exacerbate the problem  In addition the physical effect of thickening of the arteriolar walls in the kidney may prevent release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus Schindler & Sommers 1966 
Defectively synthesized renin big renin or prorenin has been shown to have reduced physiological activity De Leiva et al 1976  It has also been reported that diabetics may have increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II Christlieb 1976 Weidmann et al 1979 
This may be important as weight loss with accompanying reduction of blood pressure in obese non-diabetic hypertensives has been shown to be accompanied by reduced levels of plasma renin activity and aldosterone Tuck et al 1981  Abnormalities of the nervous system have been implicated in the development of hypertension in diabetes 
An American report found heart rate to be positively related to blood glucose Stamler et al 1975  However the relationship between blood glucose and blood pressure appeared independent of heart rate and therefore by implication either increased sympathetic activity or parasympathetic denervation 
Similar findings were reported in a British study Jarrett et al 1978  Diabetics have been found to have greater pressor responsiveness than non-diabetics with more pronounced elevation of systolic blood pressure following exercise Karlefors 1966 
Plasma catecholamine levels tend to be normal in the majority of diabetics except in those with ketoacidosis autonomic neuropathy and poor glycaemic control Christensen 1972 Christlieb 1976 Zadik et al 1980 although hypertensive diabetics may have increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines Christlieb 1976 De Chatel et al 1977  In the non-diabetic there is now considerable data showing a positive relationship between body mass index and blood pressure Boyle 1970 Wilcox 1978 Brennan et al 1980 Hovell 1982 
The evidence for this statement is based on three separate observations  First hypertensive subjects tend to increase their weight as the disease progresses Chiang et al 1969 Tyroler et al 1975 
Secondly hypertension is more frequent in obese than non-obese subjects Paffenbarger et al 1968 Stamler et al 1978 Weiss et al 1978  Lastly weight loss is frequently accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure Ramsay et al 1978 Reisin et al 1978 Fagerberg et al 1984 MacMahon et al 1985 
The pathological mechanisms for this relationship are poorly understood although several hypotheses have been proposed Messerli 1982  Elevated blood pressure itself or antihypertensive therapy may result in an inappropriately high energy intake and secondly obesity per se either due to metabolic changes or consequent upon an increased energy and possibly sodium intake with lack of exercise may predispose an individual to high blood pressure 
In addition it is possible that hypertension and obesity are linked by a common but as yet unknown factor  Finally this relationship may simply be fictitious arising from observations with an inappropriately sized sphygmomanometer cuff Ragan & Bordley 1941 King 1967 Maxwell et al 1982 
However a Belgian study in which cuff width and arm circumference were taken into account revealed that even after correcting for this relationship weight appeared correlated to blood pressure Demanet et al 1976  Many non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetics are overweight and this may be one reason for the high prevalence of hypertension observed in this group 
This association as implied previously may relate to the antinatriuretic action of insulin which is perhaps the common link between obesity and elevated blood pressure Bjorntorp 1982  Several other abnormalities have been described which may be relevant with respect to elevated blood pressure in diabetics 
These include increased platelet aggregation and blood viscosity and decreased vascular bed distensibility Khosla et al 1979 Faris et al 1982  In addition especially in insulin-dependent patients diabetic nephropathy initially presenting as either overt proteinuria or microalbuminuria may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension 
There is currently no evidence that adequate antihypertensive therapy in diabetes improves prognosis  However it has been stated that at worst similar results to those in non-diabetics might be anticipated Christlieb 1982 
In non-diabetics there are now excellent data showing a beneficial effect on several cardiovascular complications by conventional antihypertensive drugs in those with diastolic blood pressure â‰¥ 105 mm Hg Veterans Administration Cooperative Study 1967 1979 while the evidence is conflicting in those with pressures between 90 and 104 mm Hg Kaplan 1983 Toth & Horwitz 1983 despite claims to the contrary Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Cooperative Group 1979 Australian Therapeutic Trial 1980  There is no evidence that treating any level of elevated systolic blood pressure is beneficial 
It must be borne in mind that the majority of these data have been derived from subjects younger than 65 years Koch-Weser 1978 so that the effect of hypotensive drugs in the older age-groups regardless of their blood-pressure status was largely unknown until the recent publication of the European Working Party Trial which did show significant benefits in the elderly Amery et al 1985  Recently there has been speculation that the generally disappointing effects of hypotensive drug therapy in mildly hypertensive subjects may result from the deleterious metabolic side-effects of the agents themselves Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial Research Group 1982 
In the majority of studies the most frequently used drugs have been thiazide diuretics and beta-blocking agents  Their potentially adverse effects with particular reference to the diabetic will now be outlined 
Thiazides have been shown to impair carbohydrate Lewis et al 1976 Ames & Hill 1982 Murphy et al 1982 Bengtsson et al 1984 lipid and lipoprotein metabolism Goldman et al 1980 Joos et al 1980 Grimm et al 1981 and may result in impotence Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate Hypertension 1981  Thiazide diuretic agents might adversely influence carbohydrate metabolism in several ways 
The importance of potassium depletion has been suggested in several studies Conn 1965 Gorden 1973 and in another potassium supplementation was noted to reverse the detrimental effect on carbohydrate metabolism Helderman et al 1983  In addition there is some evidence that thiazide diuretic agents reduce tissue sensitivity to insulin Hicks et al 1973 accelerate the lack of insulin in the prediabetic subject Weller & Borondy 1965 and possibly reduce pancreatic insulin secretion Shapiro et al 1961 
It has also been reported that frusemide inhibits glucose transport Jung & Mookerjee 1976  A number of mechanisms have been implicated to account for the adverse effect of thiazide diuretics on lipid metabolism which include reduced lipoprotein lipase activity secondary to the decrease in insulin action Grimm et al 1981 
Changes in plasma volume may be important Ames & Hill 1976 although several observations make this rather unlikely Tarazi et al 1970 Joos et al 1980 Grimm et al 1981  In addition thiazide diuretics have been reported to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity Senft et al 1966 resulting in elevated cyclic 3 5-adenosine monophosphate levels which in turn might stimulate lipolysis in fat tissue Himms-Hagen 1972 
Î²-blockers may also adversely influence carbohydrate lipid and lipoprotein metabolism which appears particularly pronounced with the non-cardioselective agents Tanaka et al 1976 Wright et al 1979 Leren et al 1980 Day et al 1982 Veterans Administration Co-operative Study Group on Hypertensive Agents 1982 Bengtsson et al 1984  Î²-blockade might impair carbohydrate metabolism either as a consequence of direct Î²-adrenoreceptor blockade or as the result of relatively unopposed Î± activity either of which might suppress insulin release 
Indirect evidence of the latter being important is available from studies of the hyperglycaemic effect of clonidine an Î±-adrenergic agonist Hoefke 1980  Î²-blocking agents may adversely influence lipid and lipoprotein levels secondary to alpha -adrenergic stimulation which may inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity Day et al 1982 
In addition catecholamine levels are elevated during Î² blockade Rahn et al 1978 and studies in vitro have demonstrated that catecholamines inactivate lipoprotein lipase Ashby et al 1979  There has been considerable concern about the use of Î²-blocking drugs in diabetic patients in connection with hypoglycaemia and the peripheral circulation 
These drugs may aggravate hypoglycaemia Newman 1976 Lager et al 1979 may result in undamped hypertensive surges secondary to hypoglycaemic catecholamine release McMurty 1974 Shepherd et al 1981 and may threaten the peripheral circulation by arteriolar constriction McSorley & Warren 1978 Vale & Jeffreys 1978  Although symptoms such as tachycardia and tremor are masked sweating a predominantly Î±-mediated response appears more pronounced during hypoglycaemia with Î² blockade Molnar & Read 1973 Viberti et al 1978 
Despite such theoretical problems a clinical study found that Î²-blocking agents were safe in insulin-treated diabetics Barnett et al 1980  The adverse effect on the peripheral circulation is probably due to Î±-mediated vasoconstriction in the blood vessels 
In addition these agents may aggravate cardiac failure a common complication in the diabetic Garcia et al 1974 Kannel & McGee 1979  Many of the other hypotensive agents may also have side-effects that may be especially detrimental to the diabetic and these are shown in Table 3.2 
The generally disappointing effects of conventional drug therapy in mild hypertension have resulted in revived interest in non-pharmacological means of lowering blood pressure  In non-diabetics several individual dietary modifications such as diets low in sodium MacGregor et al 1982 Hoffman et al 1983 and fat Rao et al 1981 Puska et al 1983 while high in potassium Khaw & Thom 1982 MacGregor et al 1982 and fibre Wright et al 1979 Rouse et al 1983 have been shown to lower blood pressure 
Exactly how sodium restriction exerts its hypotensive action and why in only certain people remains unknown  It has been observed that sodium restriction tends to be more beneficial in hypertensives who have low plasma renin activity and in whom the aldosterone response to lowering dietary sodium is poor Vaughan et al 1973 
The reduction of intravascular fluid volume secondary to sodium restriction may be a relevant factor  An effect on the endogenous natriuretic hormone which may influence vascular tone via an effect on cellular ATPase modifying the sodium content of vascular tissue may be important De Wardner & MacGregor 1980 
Table 3.2 Complications of oral hypotensive drugs with reference to their use in diabetic subjects  Likewise how potassium may influence blood pressure is not clearly understood 
Proposed mechanisms include stimulation of the erythrocyte sodium potassium pump alteration in sodium and volume status effects on plasma renin neurogenic mechanisms and an influence on the peripheral vasculature Tannen 1985  Lowering total dietary fat while increasing the percentage of polyunsaturated fat is believed to beneficially influence blood pressures via linoleic acid which is increased by such dietary manipulation 
Linoleic acid is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid  The resultant prostaglandins may have a natriuretic or renal vasodilatory effect and thereby lower blood pressure Galli 1980 Iacono et al 1981 
Table 3.3 Summary of controlled studies of dietary manipulation on blood pressure in non-diabetic subjects  Dietary fibre may exert an influence on blood pressure due to several mechanisms 
These include an effect on gastric emptying and intestinal transit time the reduction of intraluminal pressure and colonic faecal transit all of which may alter central blood pressure regulation via afferent nerves from the gastrointestinal tract Anderson 1981  The antinatriuretic effect of insulin has also attracted interest De Fronzo 1981 
High-fibre diets tend to be associated with lower postprandial insulin concentrations than low-fibre diets Jenkins et al 1977  Additionally the effect of fibre on other gastrointestinal hormones such as gastric inhibitory polypeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and glucagon may be important probably through their effect on insulin and its antinatriuretic role Anderson 1980 
The effects of such diets individually appear small which raises the possibility that combining several of these factors may have a more substantial effect  Indeed a non-controlled Dodson & Humphreys 1981 and a controlled Beard et al 1982 trial have shown such a combined diet does lower blood pressure and importantly the quantity of antihypertensive medication required for good blood pressure control 
Some of the studies on the effect of dietary manipulation and blood pressure are shown in Table 3.3  It must be stressed that many other dietary components such as calcium other divalent ions and trace elements may be equally important with respect to blood pressure McCarron et al 1982 Saltman 1983 
These aforementioned studies were in non-diabetic hypertensive subjects but raised the possibility that similar effects might occur in diabetics  Recently there has been a reappraisal of general dietary considerations for diabetics on both sides of the Atlantic Nuttall 1980 Nutrition Sub-Committee of the British Diabetic Association 's Medical Advisory Committee 1982 
The recommendations currently include an increased quantity of unrefined or complex carbohydrate and cereal fibre with a reduction of total fat and salt  Such a diet somewhat resembles that of the native Ugandan community where hypertension was exceedingly rare Orr & Gilks 1931 
Application of this diet has produced encouraging results in essential hypertensives Dodson & Humphreys 1981  The composition of this combination approach diet compared to that considered a normal Western diet is shown in Table 3.4 
Table 3.4 Composition of the modified diet compared to that considered representative of modern western diet  Values for a modern diet in the UK are derived from the National Advisory Commission on Nutrition Education Report 1983 and the Annual Report of the National Food Survey Committee Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries & Food 1979 
Reproduced with the permission of the Controller of her Majesty 's Stationery Office  In mildly hypertensive non-insulin-dependent patients a recent controlled study using an intended diet shown in Table 3.4 lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved glycaemic control and reduced weight during a three-month period Dodson et al 1984 
In addition this diet lowered serum triglyceride levels increased HDL 2 -cholesterol and in hyperlipidaemic patients lowered serum cholesterol Pacy et al 1984 c  In an attempt to evaluate the factors possibly responsible for the reduction of blood pressure linear Pearson correlations were determined between changes in blood pressure and several other variables 
Positive correlations were observed between a reduction in the urinary sodium potassium ratio and urinary sodium excretion with systolic P<0.001 and <0.03 respectively and diastolic blood pressure P<0.001 and <0.01 respectively  Weight loss was positively correlated with only the reduction of systolic blood pressure P<0.01 
Multiple regression analysis confirmed that the reduction in the urinary sodium potassium ratio was most important relating to the decrease of systolic P < 0.0006 and diastolic blood pressure P < 0.001 Dodson et al 1984  Blacks had as beneficial a response to the diet as whites Pacy et al 1985 although results in Asians were generally disappointing Dodson et al 1983 
The blood-pressure-lowering effect of the diet was similar to that of bendrofluazide 10 mg daily which significantly worsened glycaemic control and tended to elevate total lipid levels in hyperlipidaemic subjects Pacy et al 1984a  Likewise the dietary hypotensive response was comparable to metoprolol 400 mg daily which was associated with the onset of intermittent claudication and shortness of breath in two of 25 patients 
In hyperlipidaemic subjects metoprolol tended to increase serum triglyceride levels Pacy et al 1984b  Compliance with the diet appeared satisfactory from studies in diabetics and non-diabetics over at least three months 
In one study analysis of dietary histories in 29 of 50 diabetics revealed that compliance was adequate for unrefined carbohydrate 39 per cent daily energy fibre 34 g/day and sodium 100 mmol/day although dietary fat was higher than intended 33 per cent daily energy Pacy et al 1984c  More long-term data are scarce but evidence suggests compliance may be maintained for at least four years with good blood pressure control and improved cardiovascular risk in non-diabetics Dodson et al 1982 1985 
In the light of current data for non-insulin-dependent diabetics without evidence of nephropathy and whose diastolic blood pressure is less than 110 mm Hg the high-fibre low-fat and low-sodium diet described earlier appears to be the preferred therapy and should be continued for at least three months  The obese diabetic Ideal body weight > 120 per cent Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 1959 must be encouraged to lose weight as this has been found to have a blood-pressure-lowering effect which may or may not be related to concomitant reduction of dietary sodium Reisin et al 1978 Tuck et al 1981 Fagerberg et al 1984 
However it must be borne in mind that work from the non-diabetic population has suggested that only between 30 and 50 per cent of patients are sodium sensitive Kawasaki et al 1978  Therefore it is unlikely that all patients can be expected to respond favourably to such a diet 
It would also appear prudent to encourage increased exercise as preliminary work in non-diabetics shows this may have a beneficial effect on blood-pressure levels in hypertensives Roman et al 1981  Lastly as part of general health care it is extremely important to discourage cigarette smoking 
Should these general measures fail after a minimum three-month period the drug of first choice is probably a cardioselective Î²-blocking agent such as atenolol or metoprolol or alternatively a calcium antagonist such as nifedepine  The latter agents may not cause abnormalities of either carbohydrate or lipid metabolism Donnelly & Harrower 1980 Faergeman et al 1984 Rodjmark & Andersson 1984 despite several case reports Charles et al 1981 Bhatnagar et al 1984 and they may have fewer side-effects than cardioselective Î²-blocking drugs 
If satisfactory control of hypertension is not achieved with dietary modification and one of these agents then they can be used in combination  There seems little justification for the use of thiazides in these patients 
In those with diastolic pressure over 110 mm Hg on repeated measurement the above drug regimen can be initiated concurrently with dietary modification as control of the hypertension is more urgent  Resistant hypertension poses a problem 
The recently developed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril possibly have a place here  They may be effective alone but there needs to be caution with their introduction especially enalapril which may cause hypotension when combined with other agents 
Choosing a low dose and avoiding volume depletion will minimise this potential risk  If these agents alone are not completely successful they can be combined with other agents such as diuretics but once again perhaps thiazides are best avoided in diabetics and frusemide used as an alternative 
We do of course need some good studies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in diabetic patients  Alternatives to these new agents are prazosin which influences pre- and post-load or hydralazine which influences after-load Breckenbridge 1984 
For patients with isolated systolic hypertension perhaps there is only a place for dietary therapy as although this form of hypertension is associated with increased mortality and morbidity Kannel et al 1980 evidence is lacking that drug therapy is beneficial  It is also worth bearing in mind that data on the benefits of conventional antihypertensive therapy have been derived to a large extent from subjects less than 65 years of age Koch-Weser 1978 
Thus in both types of diabetes the threshold for commencing conventional drug therapy should be higher in patients over 65 years of age although benefit has been shown in older non-diabetics in a recent study Amery et al 1985  In patients without evidence of nephropathy a similar diet and drug regimen can be used and if there are features of nephropathy the inexorable decline of renal function may be slowed by good control of hypertension Mogensen 1982 Parving et al 1983 
It has been suggested that blood pressure should be controlled at as near normotensive levels as possible to achieve maximal benefit  There are preliminary data showing that high unrefined carbohydrate diets lower serum creatinine levels in those with renal failure so this could be combined with the suggested drug regime Rivellese et al 1984 
When renal failure supervenes with sodium and water retention contributing significantly to hypertension then a diuretic may be particularly useful  Again there are advantages in choosing frusemide in preference to a thiazide in view of the increased risk of impotence and lipid abnormalities with the latter 
With the decline of renal function it is extremely important to monitor serum electrolytes closely especially in those on diuretic therapy  Finally there may be a role for either haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and cadaveric renal transplantation must not be forgotten although assessment for such treatment can only be undertaken at a few specialist centres 
In the neuropathic diabetic supine hypertension with accompanying postural hypotension is extremely difficult to treat  Many of these patients will have hypoaldosteronism and in the face of renal sodium loss the diabetic may well be sodium depleted 
In this situation low-sodium diets are contraindicated and a mineralocorticoid may be required  Fludrocortisone is often used although such replacement therapy must be closely monitored to prevent further elevation of the blood pressure 
General measures such as the use of elastic tights and elevating the head of the bed to reduce morning postural hypotension may be of benefit  One should attempt to withhold all conventional hypotensive agents for as long as possible as they will tend to exacerbate the postural hypotension 
In addition as the natural history of this extremely distressing condition is to improve with time considerable counselling and encouragement will be required  There is now good evidence that diabetics have higher levels of blood pressure particularly systolic blood pressure than age- and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects 
Hypertension is prevalent with systolic hypertension appearing the most frequent in non-insulin-dependent diabetics possibly reflecting the frequency of obesity in this group  Evidence for increased diastolic hypertension is less strong and is probably related to renal dysfunction 
As in the non-diabetic hypertension is more common in black compared to white and Asian diabetics  It is likely that hypertension adversely affects overall morbidity and mortality in diabetes and has deleterious effects on the more specific diabetic complications 
However only treatment of hypertension in diabetics with nephropathy has been shown to improve prognosis although this statement is based on very few patients  High unrefined carbohydrate high-fibre low-fat and low-sodium diets may be the initial treatment of the diabetic with mild hypertension in whom thiazide diuretic agents are relatively contraindicated 
Cardioselective Î²-blocking drugs appear the drugs of choice in the hypertensive diabetic in whom dietary therapy has failed or who has more severe hypertension although there may be an important role for the calcium antagonists  However a great deal more work in both the short and long term is required before the most appropriate hypotensive regimen in diabetes mellitus can be formulated 
Dr Paul M. Dodson qualified at St. Bartholomew 's Hospital London in 1974  He spent his early years in training at Southampton General Hospital and the Royal Berkshire Hospital Reading 
He returned to St Bartholomew 's and Moorfields Eye Hospital London in 1979 to research hyperlipidaemias that led to his MD  He moved to Dudley Road Hospital Birmingham as Senior Registrar in Medicine and Diabetes in 1982 and his current research interests include nutrition in hypertension diabetes mellitus lipid metabolism and retinovascular disease 
Although microvascular disease is the specific lesion usually associated with diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis particularly of the coronary vessels accounts for the major morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients  The evidence for this is derived from reported clinical and autopsy data in which macrovascular disease accounts for about 75 per cent of all deaths in diabetics compared to approximately 50 per cent in the non-diabetic population Ganda 1980 
Atherosclerosis appears to proceed at a more rapid rate and is more extensive in the diabetic Crall & Roberts 1978 but the process does not differ in its morphological appearance nor in its anatomical distribution compared to the non-diabetic Strandness et al 1964 Robertson & Strong 1968  This may be of considerable importance for in the non-diabetic there are long-established relationships between lipid and lipoprotein levels and macrovascular disease Gordon et al 1981 Miller et al 1981 
Similar relationships may be of equal importance in the diabetic subject  This chapter will therefore examine the relationships between serum lipids and vascular disease in the non-diabetic and the diabetic together with an outline of lipid metabolism in diabetic patients 
Other factors well known to have a prominent effect on serum lipid levels for example obesity diabetic control drug therapy alcohol consumption and diet will be discussed  The major large lipid molecules of plasma triglycerides cholesterol cholesterol esters and phospholipids are predominantly transported by stable complex water-soluble macromolecules designated lipoproteins 
These are made up of a core of non-polar lipids triglyceride and cholesterol esters with polar lipids phospholipids free cholesterol and apoproteins located on the outer part of the macromolecules Galton et al 1982  Free fatty acids which are bound to albumin are quantitatively less important than the lipoproteins but may be very significant in the context of poorly controlled diabetes with accumulation and production of ketone bodies 
The main classes of lipoprotein which can be identified by ultracentrifugation are chylomicra very low density lipoprotein VLDL low density lipoprotein LDL intermediate density lipoprotein IDL and high density lipoprotein HDL  The composition of these are shown in Table 4.1 
The apoprotein components of the lipoproteins are also demonstrated in view of the recent realisation of their importance in lipid metabolism  Table 4.1 Major lipoprotein classes composition and physical characteristics 
Figure 4.1 shows a scheme of the metabolism of lipoproteins and the important regulatory enzymes  The main triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins are secreted by the small intestine and liver as exogenous chylomicra and endogenous VLDL 
These are delipidated in peripheral tissues principally by the action of lipoprotein lipase which is secreted by adipose and muscle tissues and attached to the capillary endothelium  Important constituents of VLDL and chylomicra are three apolipoproteins namely apo- C II C III 1 and C III 2 which may be either inhibitory C III 1 and C III 2 or an obligate activator C II of lipoprotein lipase Galton et al 1982 
Degradation of VLDL produces remnant particles IDL which undergo further delipidation to yield LDL  LDL the major cholesterol-containing lipoprotein is therefore almost exclusively derived from endogenous metabolism of VLDL 
LDL is catabolised by peripheral tissues containing high-affinity cell-surface receptors which bind this lipoprotein the specificity probably directed to the apo-B component of LDL Goldstein and Brown 1974  This process is followed by endocytosis and lysosomal breakdown of LDL 
Exogenous cholesterol released inside the cell represses 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl co-enzyme A HMG/ COA reductase and there is an increase in the intracellular esterification of cholesterol Goldstein and Brown 1977  This supply of cholesterol to the cell by LDL produces feedback inhibition of intracellular cholesterol synthesis by repression of the rate-limiting enzyme 
During the breakdown of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma the C-apoproteins are lost from the particle and associate with HDL which may act as a reservoir for them  Figure 4.1

Reproduced by permission of John Wiley  HDL is mainly synthesised in the intestine and liver 
HDL of hepatic origin is secreted as a discoidal particle containing mostly phospholipids  The discoidal HDL picks up free cholesterol from the cell membranes and possibly from remnant particles and LDL 
The lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase LCAT system is active in this process and generates cholesterol esters in the HDL and converts them into a spherical shape  A mature spherical HDL particle is thus formed after acquiring apo-A particles from intestinal HDL 
Therefore HDL may be responsible for the return of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver where mature HDL particles are recognised by hepatocyte receptors leading to uptake and finally degradation for biliary excretion of cholesterol Tall & Small 1978  There are at least two major sub-fractions of mature HDL HDL 2 and HDL 3 
It is thought that the small cholesteryl ester-poor HDL 3 particles are converted to HDL 2 as they acquire cholesterol and later apolipoprotein E and that it is the HDL 2 which may release cholesterol in the liver Rothblat & Phillips 1982 Gordon et al 1983  It is also possible that apoproteins and phospholipids resulting from the breakdown of VLDL to LDL transfer to HDL 3 to form a particle resembling HDL 2 Patsch et al 1978 Tall 1979 
A description will now be given of the aetiological theories and relationships that lipids and lipoprotein levels may have with atherosclerosis  The pathognomonic lesion of atherosclerosis is the fibrous plaque which is probably due to proliferation of the smooth muscle cell in the arterial wall following an initial breach in the arterial intima Ross & Glomset 1976 Ross & Marker 1976 
This event according to Ross and co-workers is followed by deposition of intra-cellular and extracellular lipid and accumulation of other components including collagen Ross & Glomset 1976 Ross & Marker 1976  The exact cause of the initial breach in the intima is still not identified 
The disruption of the endothelial barriers occurs experimentally with most forms of injury including chemical mechanical and immune  Several theories of the factors causing smooth muscle cell proliferation have been made 
These include decline of the negative feedback of ageing stem cells of the arterial media thus allowing more rapid replication Martin et al 1975 Haylick 1976 and an as yet unidentified platelet factor formed during the platelet-release reaction Ganda 1980  Finally LDL has been implicated both as a factor responsible for the initial breach and in the increased smooth muscle cell proliferation Ross & Marker 1976 Small 1977 
The suggestion that LDL may be having a primary effect is supported by the finding of premature atherosclerosis in the presence of most primary hyperlipidaemia in particular familial hypercholesterolaemia in which elevated LDL levels are characteristically found  Other evidence suggesting that LDL is important is that LDL enters the arterial intima from plasma at rates directly related to its plasma concentration Niehaus et al 1977 Nicoll et al 1981 and accumulates particularly in atheromatous regions Nicoll et al 1981 
Endothelial injury increases this process and in some experiments can even be initiated by raised serum lipids including LDL Ross & Marker 1976  Other direct mechanisms may also be operative as the response of platelets to aggregating agents is enhanced in the presence of media rich cholesterol Shattil et al 1975 and might promote thrombotic processes underlying atherosclerosis 
However other compelling evidence that serum lipids and lipoproteins are causal or primary in the development of atherosclerosis derives from prospective clinical studies in the non-diabetic population and these will be described briefly  Many studies have shown a relationship between serum cholesterol levels and ischaemic heart disease Keys 1970 Kannel et al 1971 Wilhelmsen et al 1973 Rosenman et al 1976 Kannel et al 1979 and this relationship holds even within the normal range of serum cholesterol concentration 
This is well demonstrated in the 14-year prospective Framingham Study for individuals younger than 50 years the risk of coronary heart disease increased over 5-fold with increasing serum cholesterol levels from 4.6â€“8.7 mmol/l Kannel et al 1979  Other reports have demonstrated an even stronger positive association with plasma LDL cholesterol which is the main cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein Castelli et al 1977 Gordon et al 1977b 
A further test of the hypothesis that increased serum cholesterol and LDL levels are causative is that cholesterol lowering should reduce the incidence of ischaemic heart disease  The recent Lipid Research Clinics primary prevention programme Lipid Research Clinics Program 1984 in support of other studies Dayton et al 1969 Committee of Principal Investigators 1978 has demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of all coronary artery disease events among patients in whom serum cholesterol was effectively reduced using a combination of diet and cholestyramine 
In contrast levels of HDL tend to show an inverse relationship with the incidence of coronary artery disease and hence the name the protective lipoprotein Castelli et al 1977 Gordon et al 1977b Miller et al 1977a  The mechanism of the protective function may be as follows cholesterol is mobilised from the arterial wall by HDL 3 which is converted to HDL 2 by this process of cholesterol enrichment 
Another aspect of the protective function for HDL is possibly reduction of LDL uptake by competitive binding with the LDL receptor thereby reducing the cholesterol supply to the endothelial cell Miller et al 1977 b  These associations have also been confirmed in angiographic studies as the severity of coronary artery disease increases with increasing LDL and with decreasing HDL levels Tan et al 1980 Miller et al 1981 
The protective effect of HDL against atheroma formation is believed to be due to the HDL 2 subfraction Miller et al 1981  The role of serum triglyceride remains controversial 
Several studies have reported a positive association with ischaemic heart disease but after correction for the effect of cholesterol serum triglyceride does not appear to be an independent risk factor Hulley et al 1980  Also these studies did not take into account HDL levels which are well known to be inversely related to serum triglyceride concentrations Hulley et al 1980 
Another site of damage in diabetes may be the microcirculation which might be important in disease of the myocardium in diabetic subjects  Little data are currently available on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels in relation to microvascular disease although recent studies in microcirculation in sites other than the myocardium suggest that hyperlipidaemia and increasing LDL levels may be implicated Dodson et al 1981a 1982 
There are abundant data to support causal associations between serum cholesterol and LDL with macrovascular disease in the non-diabetic Lewis 1983  In view of the similarity of atherogenesis in the diabetic and non-diabetic Strandness et al 1964 Robertson & Strong 1968 it is likely that similar relationships apply in diabetic subjects although the evidence that this is true is not so strong 
Table 4.2 Major abnormalities in circulating lipids found in poorly controlled or newly diagnosed diabetics  A number of studies have reported that hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia are common in diabetes mellitus 
A summary of the major abnormalities of circulating lipid and lipoproteins found according to the type of diabetes are shown in Table 4.2  Despite extensive research the exact prevalence of hyperlipidaemia has not been determined due to methodological differences 
The major problems include the definition of the normal range for fasting cholesterol and triglyceride failure to divide diabetics into appropriate insulin- or non-insulin-dependent categories and also the inclusion of newly diagnosed diabetics together with those with long-established disease  Albrink stated that hypertriglyceridaemia is the hyperlipidaemia par excellence of the diabetic Albrink 1974 
Most studies support this statement with prevalence rates for hypertriglyceridaemia ranging from 20â€“50 per cent New et al 1963 Wilson et al 1970b Hayes 1972 Albrink 1974 Garcia et al 1974 Kaufman et al 1975 Chase & Glasgow 1976 Nikkila & Hormila 1978 Mancini et al 1980 Lisch & Sailer 1981 Pacy et al 1985 depending on type of diabetes diabetic control age sex ethnic origin and nutritional status in particular fat and alcohol intake  For example in the large Framingham population Garcia et al 1974 239 diabetics of equal sex distribution and age range 30â€“62 years were studied prospectively 
Thirty-nine per cent of these were insulin treated 39 per cent were managed on oral hypoglycaemic agents and 22 per cent were not receiving treatment or following a diabetic diet  In this group 38 per cent of males and 27 per cent of females demonstrated hypertriglyceridaemia 
Interestingly a more marked sex difference was noted for hypercholesterolaemia with prevalence rates in females at 48 per cent and in males 28 per cent  All these prevalence rates were strikingly increased when compared to matched non-diabetic controls except that of hypercholesterolaemia in males 
Similar findings to these have also been reported in true Type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes Kaufman et al 1975  One recent study has also defined the types of hyperlipidaemia by ultracentrifugation and classified according to the Fredrickson types in a group of 86 Type 2 diabetics and a control group 
Mancini et al 1980  Hypertriglyceridaemia was well represented with a marked increase in Type 2b the type with combined hyperlipidaemia at 24 per cent compared to 2 per cent in the control group 
Type 4 hyperlipidaemia representing mainly hypertriglyceridaemia was also increased at 18 per cent in the diabetics compared to 10 per cent in controls  Although other types of hyperlipidaemia were not identified in this study primary hyperlipidaemia for example Type 5 characterised by gross increase of the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein are well documented to occur with diabetes mellitus Bagdade et al 1967 Glueck 1977 
Other primary familial hyperlipidaemias may also occur Brunzell et al 1975  The prevalence rate of hypercholesterolaemia in diabetics has been reported to be similar to the non-diabetic population that is from 8 per cent to as high as 52 per cent Hayes 1972 
However in the majority of studies a high prevalence rate of hypercholesterolaemia has been found New et al 1963 Wilson et al 1970b Chase & Glasgow 1976 Mancini et al 1980 Sosenko et al 1980 Yano et al 1982 Pacy et al 1985  Clinical factors relating to hypercholesterolaemia are similar to those for hypertriglyceridaemia and include obesity poor diabetic control increasing age sex and type of diabetes 
It should be noted that there is some evidence from two studies that mean levels of serum cholesterol are higher in subjects with just impaired glucose tolerance than age-matched controls Ostrander et al 1980 Yano et al 1982  This raises the possibility that abnormalities may even predate the onset of overt diabetes and might date from adolescence or before Tzagournis et al 1968 Florey et al 1976 Voors et al 1981 
Studies are therefore mostly in agreement that hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are more prevalent in both Type I and 2 diabetic subjects especially at diagnosis of diabetes  But the degree of diabetic control appears very important as the best controlled diabetics may have lipid levels similar to non-diabetics Wolff & Salt 1958 Nikkila & Hormila 1978 whereas increasingly poor control may be associated with significant increases in serum lipids and lipoprotein levels Sosenko et al 1980 
Diabetic treatment particularly in Type 2 patients may also have a profound effect  For example higher levels of serum lipids are often associated with diabetic treatment of diet either alone or in combination with an oral hypoglycaemic agent when compared to those on insulin treatment Lisch & Sailer 1981 
Likewise obesity appears to be an important determinant with a trend for higher triglyceride levels to be observed in the more obese diabetic subjects Braunsteiner et al 1966 Nikkila & Hormila 1978  Recent attention has also been given to the diabetic with regard to ethnic differences in serum lipid levels which have been observed in the non-diabetic population 
It appears that black males and females of West Indian origin have a strikingly lower prevalence of both hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia compared to those of Asian or European extract Pacy et al 1985  These differences might of course partly contribute to the dissimilar patterns of cardiovascular disease seen in different ethnic groups Cruickshank et al 1980 
Several studies have reported that abnormal lipoprotein levels frequently accompany diabetes mellitus Hayes 1972 Garcia et al 1974 Chase & Glasgow 1976 Nikkila & Hormila 1978 Mancini et al 1980 Lisch & Sailer 1981 Steiner 1981  Abnormalities that may occur in poorly or newly diagnosed diabetes are shown in Table 4.2 these include increased VLDL and LDL levels in all types of diabetes as already mentioned but with good diabetic control both these abnormalities may completely resolve Nikkila & Hormila 1978 Lisch & Sailer 1981 
With regard to HDL levels in general diabetic women have lower HDL-cholesterol levels than diabetic men when compared with non-diabetic controls Gordon et al 1977 a Beach et al 1979  However there are differences between Type I and 2 diabetes HDL levels are generally either normal or low in Type 2 diabetes Lopes-Virella et al 1977 Kennedy et al 1978 Reckless et al 1978 Taylor et al 1981 Rendel et al 1982 Studies on the subfractions have shown either an increase in the level of the HDL 3 subfraction Durrington 1982 or a reduction in HDL 2 
Reduced lipoprotein lipase activity may give rise to low HDL levels and hypertriglyceridaemia in this type of diabetes  Other factors which may relate to lower HDL levels include poor diabetic control increasing age obesity an inverse relationship to serum triglycerides androgens smoking and although controversial a high carbohydrate dietary intake Ganda 1980 
Sulphonylurea therapy commonly instituted in diabetic subjects has also been implicated Calvert et al 1978 but more recently refuted Taylor et al 1982  In contrast HDL levels may be elevated or normal in Type I diabetic subjects Garcia et al 1974 Mattock et al 1979 Lopes-Virella et al 1983 
The reason for an increase may be related to increased VLDL catabolism which in turn produces the apoproteins and lipids forming an integral part of HDL  With regard to HDL subfractions in insulin-dependent diabetics data are conflicting but some studies have demonstrated a significant increase in HDL3 in males but not in females Mattock et al 1980 
Other factors independent of diabetes which may elevate HDL levels in a particular patient include moderate alcohol intake Hulley et al 1979 exercise Hartung et al 1980 ethnic origin Pacy et al 1985 and oestrogens Bradley et al 1978  A reduction of HDL levels may also be caused by hypolipidaemic therapy in particular probucol and Î²-blocking drug therapy used in the treatment of hypertension Dodson 1982a 
Insulin plays a crucial role in triglyceride and VLDL metabolism particularly as the clearing enzyme lipoprotein lipase is dependent on insulin for its activity Brunzell & Bierman 1978  In insulin-deficiency states as in Type I diabetes lipoprotein lipase activity estimated by post-heparin lipolytic activity may be impaired with resultant hypertriglyceridaemia 
If severe this may result in the diabetic lipaemia that is particularly seen in poorly controlled or newly diagnosed diabetics Bagdade et al 1967  Restoration to normal circulating insulin levels promptly restores enzyme activity with a decrease in serum triglycerides Kissebah et al 1974 
The aetiology of hypertriglyceridaemia in Type I diabetics subsequently controlled and established on insulin is less clear but would appear to centre round the control and activity of lipoprotein lipase  Some studies have demonstrated no deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity Jones et al 1966 Nikkila & Hormila 1978 while others have suggested that there may be a relative deficiency of activity on prolonged stimulation with heparin infusion Brunzell et al 1973 
It is therefore possible that subtle abnormalities of lipoprotein lipase activity may occur  It is probable that in most hypertriglyceridaemic insulin-dependent patients the main defect is at the lipoprotein lipase level and hence there is a clearance defect 
A contributory factor in the mechanism of diabetic hypertriglyceridaemia may be increased free fatty acid turnover which is consistently found in uncontrolled diabetes Lewis et al 1972  As free fatty acids are the precursors of synthesis of triglyceride for incorporation into VLDL in the liver it is not surprising that VLDL-triglyceride turnover may be increased in diabetics Nikkila & Kekki 1973 
This may therefore give rise to increased endogenous triglyceride synthesis and release in the form of VLDL  This component of overproduction may therefore be an additional aetiology to that of the clearance defect described above 
Some diabetics may also have underlying familial forms of hypertriglyceridaemia per se Brunzell et al 1979  In contrast in Type 2 diabetes lipoprotein lipase activity is relatively intact Nikkila et al 1977 but overproduction of VLDL is the most likely cause of the hypertriglyceridaemia 
The explanation for this may be that free fatty acids are released from adipose tissue in the presence of insulin resistance and in the presence of increased circulating insulin levels an increase in hepatic synthesis of triglyceride will tend to occur especially if the liver retains normal insulin sensitivity Topping & Mayes 1972 Kissebah et al 1974  This will lead to enhanced VLDL formation and release 
The situation may therefore be one of predominantly increased production of VLDL however it is also likely that a clearance defect is operative as the rate of disappearance of intravenous Intralipid was reduced in a study of Type 2 diabetics possibly due to low fatty acid incorporation into adipose tissue Lewis et al 1972  The relative importance of increased secretion and/or impaired catabolism of circulating triglyceride in causing diabetic lipaemia has yet to be determined 
However it is probable that varying degrees of impairment of peripheral uptake of triglyceride interact with enhanced normal or decreased secretion of VLDL to produce the wide range of lipid levels observed in untreated diabetes  More recent research has identified structural abnormalities in the composition of VLDL in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia 
These have consisted of altered ratios of the modulator C-apolipoproteins found in VLDL  The obligate activator apo-C II has been shown to result in poor activation of lipoprotein lipase in vitro when present in very low or excess amounts in VLDL 
Excess of Apo-C III 2 has also been demonstrated in diabetic subjects with severe hypertriglyceridaemia Holdsworth et al 1982  Catabolism of VLDL by lipoprotein lipase is impaired in vitro with this C-apoprotein abnormality and may therefore produce a clearance defect in vivo 
Further research is needed in this area and it is possible that important abnormalities in the modulating apoproteins may be found  Cholesterol in the blood is mainly transported by LDL and attention must therefore be focussed on LDL metabolism 
The production of increased LDL levels is probably by three major mechanisms  The first is the suggestion of an absolute increase in LDL synthesis Kissebah et al 1976 which may be corrected by improved diabetic control Bennion & Grundy 1977 
The second mechanism may be through the effect of insulin which actually may increase the number of LDL receptors at a cellular level Chait et al 1978  Therefore in insulin-deficient states a decrease in receptor numbers would be expected with consequent delay in LDL clearance 
The third mechanism is now well documented in vitro and involves non-enzymatic glycosylation of apoprotein B of LDL Gonen et al 1981 Kim & Kurup 1982 Witzum et al 1982  A 2- to 3-fold increase in the amount of glucose bound to lysine of apoprotein B has been demonstrated in the serum of diabetic subjects 
This finding may be important since it is known that chemical modification of lysine amino groups of the apoprotein may interfere with the specific LDL receptor binding and hence clearance of LDL Gonen et al 1981 Kim & Kurup 1982 Witzum et al 1982  An interesting finding which may also be relevant is that there have been reports of a triglyceride-enriched LDL present in diabetics regardless of type and treatment Schonfeld et al 1974 Mancini et al 1980 
The mechanism and pathophysiological significance of this abnormality remain unclear but it may be a remnant particle accumulation which might in itself be atherogenic e.g. like LDL  Other factors which might be contributory to hypercholesterolaemia in diabetics include increased VLDL levels which contain a small amount of cholesterol and a diet high in total and saturated fat that was previously employed in the treatment of diabetes 
A number of studies have suggested that good glycaemic control in diabetes may reverse a number of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities  Hayes in 1972 reanalysed lipid levels after short-term introduction of diabetic therapy 
Good glycaemic control produced a reduction in the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia from 52â€“12.5 per cent with a similar decrease in hypertriglyceridaemia 50â€“17.9 per cent  Longer term analysis still showed a reduction in the prevalence rates but it was not as impressive 
Other later short-term studies have confirmed these findings Tamborlane 1979 Dunn et al 198 1 and deterioration of glycaemic control has also been shown to elevate lipid and lipoprotein levels Sosenko et al 1980 Lopes-Virella et al 1981  Generally the effect on triglyceride metabolism of excellent diabetic control is more profound than it is on cholesterol and LDL 
Therefore some authors have suggested that plasma lipid levels are a further test of diabetic control and if abnormal levels are detected careful attention should be paid to improving blood glucose control  Dietary therapy has long been the cornerstone of diabetic management 
The modern diabetic diet consists of high unrefined carbohydrate and fibre with a low fat content  Many studies have now shown that this sort of regimen improves total serum cholesterol and LDL levels in both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetics in the short and long term Simpson et al 1979a b Dodson et al 1981b 
If more viscous fibres are used e.g. guar gum preparations more marked changes in serum cholesterol levels may be seen Dodson et al 1981b Aro et al 1981  Serum triglyceride levels are generally unaltered in both short- and long-term studies Dodson et al 1985 providing unrefined carbohydrate is used as opposed to refined carbohydrate which has been shown to be hypertriglyceridaemic in some studies Reaven 1980 
Recent studies of hyperlipidaemic diabetics treated with a high-fibre unrefined carbohydrate and low-fat content diet have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cholesterol and triglyceride levels on this type of diet Pacy et al 1984a  The situation with regard to HDL and its subfractions is unclear 
Some short-term studies of the diabetic diet have shown either a reduction of HDL cholesterol Rivellese et al 1980 Simpson et al 1981 no effect Dodson et al 1984 or significant elevations Dodson et al 1981 b  Data on HDL 2 are more scanty but it would appear that there may be an elevation of this subfraction in the longer term in diabetics on a dietary regimen similar to that currently recommended by the British Diabetic Association Pacy et al 1984 c 
The exact mechanisms of these effects are not entirely clear but are probably multifactorial and related to changes in improved diabetic control dietary fat intake and weight reduction  It would therefore appear that nutritional modifications in themselves have an important effect on serum lipids and lipoproteins 
The current recommended diabetic dietary regimen appears to result in a reduction in lipid cardiovascular risk  Alcohol may have several effects on serum lipids 
These include enhancement of alimentary lipaemia if a meal is preceded by alcohol Wilson et al 1970a and chronic alcohol-related hyperlipidaemia in susceptible individuals  The main mechanism of these effects is probably increased incorporation of both dietary and endogenous fatty acids into VLDL by the small intestine Lewis 1976 
Alcohol may also affect cholesterol metabolism by decreasing catabolism to bile acids Lefevre et al 1972  The most frequent effect of excess alcohol intake on serum lipids is elevation of triglyceride levels 
Severe lipaemia due to chronic alcohol abuse may result in recurrent attacks of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus  In this situation there may be a familial hyperlipidaemia the expression of which is heightened by alcohol ingestion or poor diabetic control 
Obesity is a common finding particularly in Type 2 diabetes  Excess alcohol intake tends to contribute to obesity with increased VLDL production and an associated reduction of HDL levels 
There has been recent concern with regard to the precipitation and aggravation of diabetes mellitus by thiazide diuretics Murphy et al 1982 and Î²-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and others used in the treatment of hypertension  These drugs may also adversely affect serum lipids and lipoproteins 
A lowering of HDL-cholesterol with elevation of serum cholesterol and triglyceride has been well documented in non-diabetics Goldman et al 1980 but little studied in the diabetic  However it would appear that serum triglyceride levels are significantly increased by thiazide diuretics in normolipaemic Type 2 diabetics whereas in those formerly hyperlipidaemic there is only a minor increase Gill et al 1984 Pacy et al 1984 a 
B-blocking agents have been associated with similar effects Dodson 1982 Pacy et al 1984b but HDL-cholesterol levels were not affected by either group of drugs in diabetic subjects Dodson 1982 Pacy et al 1984 b  Other therapeutic agents well known to adversely affect serum lipid levels include oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives androgens and moderate dosage of corticosteroid therapy 
Several studies have addressed possible relationships between macrovascular disease and serum lipids and lipoproteins but whatever the contribution serum lipids make to macrovascular disease many other interrelating factors have to be considered  Even so using multivariate analysis to adjust for many of these including cigarette smoking sex duration of diabetes hypertension and obesity the Framingham investigators concluded that all these are insufficient to account for the excess incidence of coronary heart disease particularly in female diabetics Garcia et al 1974 
However as in the non-diabetic data are available suggesting a link between serum lipids and in particular coronary heart disease  A possible role for triglyceride in the pathogenesis of macrovascular disease of diabetes mellitus was postulated by Albrink in 1963 in a retrospective study of 139 patients Albrink et al 1963 
He contrasted the lower plasma triglyceride levels and less evidence of atherosclerosis observed in the 1930s with the higher levels of these features in the 1950s  Further evidence suggesting a positive link has been demonstrated in other cross-sectional studies New et al 1963 Ahuja et al 1969 Santen et al 1972 Albrink 1974 Lamda et al 1974 Reckless et al 1978 Seviour et al 1985 
New found that fasting triglyceride levels were significantly higher in diabetics aged between 31â€“50 years with complications compared to those without although no such relationship was observed in diabetics over 50 years of age New et al 1963  No association was found with cholesterol levels but a distinction was made between macrovascular and microvascular complications in this study 
Similar findings were recorded by Santen who compared lipid levels in 52 diabetics with macrovascular disease and a well age- and sex-matched normotensive control population Santen et al 1972  The mean fasting triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the diabetic macrovascular disease group were significantly higher than controls in the 30â€“59 age-group 
In those aged 60â€“69 years similar trends were observed only for fasting triglyceride  The effect of obesity was considered but although mean levels of triglyceride were increased by 28 per cent in obese subjects the levels were still increased in lean diabetics with macrovascular disease compared to lean controls 
Albrink demonstrated a similar association in a subsequent study with 82 per cent of diabetics greater than 50 years of age with clinically apparent atherosclerosis having triglyceride levels greater than 1.7 mmol/l compared to 50 per cent of those without atherosclerosis Albrink 1974  In addition several studies in diabetics have suggested that raised serum cholesterol levels are also associated with the presence of macrovascular disease 
Lamda found that 68.2 per cent of diabetics had cholesterol levels greater than 6.5 mmol/l and of the 23 diabetics with cholesterol levels above 7.75 mmol/l 87 per cent had cardiovascular complications Lamda et al 1974  Reckless reported a large series of 154 diabetics who were examined for the presence of macrovascular complications with relation to actual lipoprotein levels Reckless et al 1978 
Clinical evidence of vascular disease was found in 38.3 per cent of patients and 30 per cent were hyperlipidaemic  Vascular disease was more common in those with higher concentrations of cholesterol triglycerides LDL and VLDL and was less prevalent in those with higher HDL levels 
In insulin-dependent patients and all male patients cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were positively associated with vascular disease but there was no inverse relationship with HDL  In the non-insulin-dependent diabetics and in all females a strong inverse relationship was noted with HDL cholesterol 
A weak positive association was only demonstrated with serum triglyceride VLDL-triglyceride and LDL in females  A more recent study in a small number of patients has emphasised these sex differences Seviour et al 1985 
In 16 female Type 2 diabetic patients with clinically overt macrovascular disease significantly higher serum triglyceride and lower total HDL-cholesterol levels were shown compared to those without macrovascular disease but who were well matched for age duration of diabetes weight and glycaemic control  Interestingly HDL 2 subfraction levels were also studied with mean levels 79 per cent lower in those with macrovascular disease 
Although these cross-sectional studies suggest a similar positive relationship as in the non-diabetic between coronary heart disease and increasing serum cholesterol triglyceride VLDL and LDL levels and possibly a negative association with HDL confirmation of their contribution should be sought from prospective studies  The Framingham Study in 1974 reported a 16-year follow-up of diabetic patients but did not include measurement of HDL or LDL cholesterol 
The subsequent Framingham Study in 1977 reported a shorter term follow-up and included serum lipids and lipoproteins in a multivariate analysis in a total cohort of 4939 subjects Garcia et al 1974  However only 10.4 per cent of these were diabetic 
A separate multivariate analysis of diabetics was not reported but using standardised logistic regression coefficients for incidence of coronary heart disease strong relationships were demonstrated in the whole group as shown in Table 4.3  LDL-cholesterol levels were positively associated with coronary heart disease in both women and men although this effect was stronger in men 
Both sexes also demonstrated a strong negative relationship with HDL-cholesterol  However serum triglyceride levels did not prove to be a significant factor for coronary heart disease in this multivariate analysis and this is probably because of the correction made for the inverse relationship between triglycerides and HDL 
Thus in the Framingham Study triglycerides do not appear to be an independent risk factor  This has also been supported by observations in Japanese and Hawaiian men Chung et al 1969 and is consistent with the low rate of macrovascular disease found in Pima Indians Ingelfinger et al 1976 and Bantu diabetics Shapiro et al 1973 in both of whom hypertriglyceridaemia is extremely common 
Prospective studies have also been performed in subjects with impaired glucose intolerance  In both the Whitehall and Hawaiian Studies Fuller et al 1980 Yano et al 1982 increasing serum cholesterol levels carried a higher coronary disease mortality but multivariate analysis did not demonstrate serum cholesterol as an independent risk factor in either report 
Table 4.3 Multivariate analysis of serum lipid and lipoprotein levels for the incidence of coronary heart disease in the Framington Study 1977  It would therefore appear that as in the non-diabetic consistent evidence points to serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol as positive risk factors for coronary heart disease in the diabetic 
HDL-cholesterol may also be a predictor with an inverse relationship particularly in female diabetic subjects  Therefore part of the explanation for diabetes mellitus conferring an increased incidence of vascular complications may be the adverse effects of diabetes on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels 
These conclusions are probably most valid for the female Type 2 diabetic subject in whom it is interesting to speculate that serum lipid levels may have been towards the upper end of the normal distribution even in adolescence  Thus by the time of diagnosis of diabetes in middle age these subjects may have already had 30 years or more of exposure to these atherogenic factors Jarrett 1984 
Future clinical research will no doubt give us further insight into the role of lipid abnormalities in the development of macrovascular disease in the diabetic  Biochemical aspects which may also be important include further elucidation of the metabolism of HDL and its subfractions the apoprotein B composition and its effect on LDL metabolism and the interrelationships of serum lipids with other factors for example platelet function 
Like moderate hyperglycaemia significantly elevated lipid levels are often not associated with clinical features so patients need regular screening for hyperlipidaemia  The initial test of a random serum cholesterol and triglyceride estimation is sufficient 
A random as opposed to a fasting sample has advantages as this can be performed in the routine diabetic clinic and in particular does not require a separate visit with alterations in timing of hypoglycaemic drug therapy  A random cholesterol estimation of greater than approximately 6.5 mmol/l in a diabetic patient aged less than 60 years should be repeated after a 1 2-hour overnight fast and taken before morning hypoglycaemic therapy on two further occasions to establish the diagnosis of hyperlipidaemia 
The level of fasting cholesterol at which the diagnosis of hypercholesterolaemia is made will vary from clinic to clinic  In our clinic we have chosen > 6.5 mmol/l in the under sixties for both sexes 
We do not see the need for the level to be higher in diabetics than in non-diabetics  Above this level the rate of coronary heart disease increases steeply in non-diabetic prospective studies Kannel et al 1971 Goldbourt et al 1985 
Hypertriglyceridaemia is more difficult to define Hulley et al 1980 but it is our practice to institute active treatment of fasting serum triglyceride levels consistently 5 mmol/l or above in diabetic subjects when we are confident it is not secondary hypertriglyceridaemia  When hyperlipidaemia is identified in a diabetic subject attention must be focussed on diabetic control obesity diet alcohol intake and drugs such as thiazides or Î²-blocking agents 
The achievement of good glycaemic control with HbA 1 â‰¤10 per cent at a satisfactory body weight is an essential first step in the management of diabetic hyperlipidaemia  A common factor to improving diabetic control and weight loss is modification of dietary intake 
The general dietary recommendations for diabetics of a diet high in fibre and unrefined carbohydrate combined with a reduced fat content appears to lower serum lipids as well as improving diabetic control in hyperlipidaemic diabetic subjects and should therefore be advised Pacy et al 1984 a c  Total energy content should be adjusted to obtain weight loss in obese subjects 
Attention should be directed towards the type of fat consumed  Saturated table and cooking fats should be replaced with those of a polyunsaturated nature a manoeuvre which has been shown to lower serum cholesterol levels Keys et al 1965 
Predisposing factors must be searched for and treated  For example thyroid and renal disease alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis may be identified 
Attention should be focussed on concomitant drug therapy for example thiazide diuretics which may be important aetiological factors  It must be remembered that hyperlipidaemia in a well-controlled diabetic may also represent a primary familial disorder and it is often difficult to differentiate between this and diabetes complicated by hypertriglyceridaemia 
A careful family history and investigation of first-degree relatives may be helpful  If hyperlipidaemia persists despite simple measures then drug therapy may be instituted 
Combined hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia is the common form requiring treatment  The agent of choice is one of the more recent clofibrate analogues e.g. bezafibrate which lowers both cholesterol and triglyceride levels by reducing cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis 
This agent may also improve blood glucose control Wahl et al 1980  If hypercholesterolaemia is a persisting problem then the anion-exchange resins cholestyramine or colestipol may be effective in lowering serum cholesterol by increasing the excretion of bile salts 
When inadequate response occurs or there is difficulty in compliance owing to the need to ingest a large bulk of exchange resins a further agent may be required e.g. bezafibrate  Severe lipaemia is rarely found but requires more urgent treatment 
Cessation of alcohol abuse with which this condition is often associated may dramatically reduce the lipaemia but other methods can be employed  These include continuous insulin infusion or plasma exchange 
Severe lipaemia in an undiagnosed diabetic will usually resolve with the institution of insulin therapy and effective diabetic control  However it must be emphasised that generally hyperlipidaemia combined with diabetes mellitus can be adequately treated with attention to dietary measures promoting weight loss and improving glycaemic control 
Dr John Betteridge obtained his BSc in biochemistry in 1969 and qualified MB BS from King 's College Hospital Medical School in 1972  After Senior House Office appointments at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Brompton Hospital he moved to St Bartholomew 's Hospital as Junior Registrar and subsequently as Research Fellow supported by an R.D. Lawrence Memorial Fellowship from the British Diabetic Association 
He obtained his MD in 1979 following studies of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in diabetic and hyperlipoproteinaemic subjects  From 1979 to 1981 he was Senior Registrar in Medicine at the Royal United Hospital in Bath and during that time carried out research into platelet function in diabetes and hyperlipoproteinaemic states 
He was awarded his PhD in 1985  Dr Betteridge is currently Senior Lecturer in Medicine at University College London and Honorary Consultant Physician at University College Hospital 
His main research interests are in the biochemistry of vascular disease in diabetes and hyperlipoproteinaemia  The already high incidence of vascular disease in non-diabetic western populations appears to be still higher in diabetic subjects and although there have been suggestions of a specific diabetic large-vessel disease Lundbaek 1973 there is little evidence to suggest that atherosclerotic lesions in diabetics are distinct from those in non-diabetics Strandness et al 1964 
However atherosclerosis appears to be more extensive and to develop at an earlier age in diabetic patients Robertson & Strong 1968  These pathological findings are in agreement with clinical studies the most convincing evidence coming from the prospective community study in Framingham 
All major clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis were found to have an increased incidence in diabetics Garcia et al 1974  Many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of large-vessel disease in diabetic patients as in non-diabetic subjects however the increased incidence in diabetics has not been fully explained in terms of known risk factors Jarrett et al 1982 
Therefore other metabolic abnormalities have been sought in diabetic subjects which might contribute to the increased vascular risk  In this chapter the possible role of enhanced platelet function in the development of diabetic vascular disease will be discussed because of the postulated role of platelets in early lesions of atheroma and their importance in the development of thrombus on pre-existing atheromatous plaques leading to final arterial occlusion 
In addition Colwell et al 1978 have postulated that abnormal platelet function secondary to the diabetic state may contribute to the development of the specific microvascular disease of diabetics which makes an important contribution to morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population principally through retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy and possibly also a cardiopathy Keen & Jarrett 1982  Platelets which like red blood cells do not contain a nucleus are the smallest of the formed elements of blood circulating as biconcave discs approximately 2â€“3 Î¼ m in diameter 
They are formed from megakaryocytes which in the final process of maturation become amoeboid in shape and their pseudopods penetrate the marrow sinusoids  These pseudopods fragment in the blood flow with the nucleus remaining in the bone marrow 
The normal circulating count varies in man between 150 and 400 Ã— 10 9 /l and mean platelet survival is about 9.9 days  Platelets are removed from the circulation in the spleen and liver 
Platelets have a central role in normal haemostasis  Through their properties of adherence to vascular or foreign surfaces and their aggregation with other platelets they can initiate haemostasis 
Platelets also participate in the fluid phase of coagulation through their active biochemical contents and by providing surfaces for reactions to take place  Platelets may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis 
Platelet structure and its relationship to platelet function has been given tremendous impetus through the application of electromicroscopy to the study of platelet anatomy and the development of techniques for isolation of physiologically active platelets and their preservation for ultrastructural study  The subject has been reviewed White et al 1981 and will be briefly described here see Figure 5.1 
The peripheral zone comprises the platelet cell surface the surface connected open canalicular system the exterior coat or glycocalyx the unit membrane and the submembrane region  The glycocalyx of platelets is thicker and more dense than surface coats of other blood cells and is rich in glycoproteins Berndt & Phillips 1981 which is not surprising bearing in mind the number of receptor functions and transport mechanisms active at the platelet surface 
Using various surface-labelling probes many different glycoproteins have been identified on the platelet surface > 30 and some notably Ib IIb III and IV are present in high concentration and their functional roles are emerging  The trilaminar unit membrane of the peripheral zone which provides the physiochemical separation between extracellular and intracellular constituents has important components including the sodium/potassium ATPase 
The membrane lipids important as sources of arachidonic acid for the cyclo-oxygenase reaction are distributed asymmetrically with sphingomyelin and phosphatidyl choline on the outside and phosphatidyl inositol phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl serine on the inner surface Schick 1979  The submembrane region contains a regular system of filamentous elements White 1969 which can be seen lateral to the circumferential band of microtubules in discoid platelets Zucker-Franklin 1970 
These filaments which are in close association with the cell membrane may be concerned with the maintenance of platelet shape and in pseudopod formation in conjunction with actin-binding protein and Î±-actinin Lucas et al 1976 Schollmeyer et al 1978  The so-called sol-gel zone of platelets contains the important microtubules and microfilaments 
Microtubules of which tubulin is the major protein constituent are located in a circumferential band in the equatorial plane just under the cell wall in discoid platelets which suggests that they may be important in maintenance of the platelet cytoskeleton  In addition microtubules may be involved in the internal alignment of platelet organelles before the release reaction and furthermore may help govern the degree of response to circulating agonists White et al 1981

The second system of fibres in the sol-gel zone of platelets comprises the microfilaments White 1971  They resemble actin filaments found in other contractile cells such as muscle and platelet actin has a 100-fold excess over platelet myosin Pollard 1975 
The microfilament system provides the contractile capacity for the release reaction seen in activated platelets Adelstein & Pollard 1978  Cohen et al 1980 have postulated that the actin filaments are anchored to the platelet membrane by Î±-actin glycoprotein III a transmembrane protein 
The actin filaments extend into the cytoplasm from this point and form long filaments orientated concentrically around the platelet granules  The myosin filaments would interdigitate between the actin filaments in opposite directions and help to push the platelet granules into the centre of the platelet for release into the surface-connected open canalicular system 
The platelet organelle zone is rich in several types of organelles  In addition to mitochondria platelet cytoplasm contains numerous granules and dense bodies which have been distinguished by density ultrastructural studies and biochemical content 
The dense bodies 250â€“300 nm so-called because of the electron-dense opaque internal content when visualized with the electron microscope are the storage sites for 5-hydroxytryptamine adenine nucleotides calcium and pyrophosphate Holmsen & Weiss 1979  Î±-granules are the most numerous of platelet organelles and they have a variety of densities and staining characteristics 
These granules 300â€“500 nm store many proteins some of which are specific to platelets such as platelet factor 4 Î²-thromboglobulin low-affinity platelet factor 4 and platelet-derived growth factor  In addition Î±-granules contain proteins which are found in other cells and plasma such as fibrinogen fibronectin albumin and factor VIII-related antigen 
It is probable that there are different types of Î±-granules with different granular contents which may be released in different situations Kaplan 1981  Platelets also possess a variety of lysosomal enzyme-storage organelles containing acid hydrolases including Î²-glucuronidase and Î²-galactosidase Holmsen 1975 
Platelets contain two important membrane systems the surface-connected open canalicular system and the dense tubular system  The canalicular system consists of tortuous invaginations of the platelet wall running through the platelet cytoplasm and therefore greatly increasing the total surface area of platelet/ plasma contact Behnke 1970 
This system remains patent despite platelet contraction adhesion and aggregation and probably serves for the release of the contents of the platelet-storage granules to plasma White 1973  The dense tubular system which probably represents residual smooth endoplasmic reticulum is discrete from the open canalicular system Behnke 1970 but forms very close relationships with it in certain areas of the cytoplasm White 1972 
An important physiologic role for the dense tubular system is calcium sequestration through the activity of the calcium/magnesium ATPase Cutler et al 1978  A series of complex reactions involving the vessel wall plasma proteins and platelets occur to reduce the loss of blood following injury to the vasculature 
Platelets contribute to these complex reactions in three main ways they adhere to exposed collagen and form a physical plug to occlude the wound they release active substances from their secretory granules which help to consolidate the initial platelet plug they play an important role in interacting with the coagulation system and certain intrinsic coagulation reactions occur preferentially on the platelet surface  The process of platelet plug formation has been reviewed by Sixma & Wester 1977 
Macroscopic observations of haemostatic plug formation have been made in animal models particularly the hamster cheek pouch and the rabbit mesentery  Whereas transection of a capillary causes no bleeding arterial transection results in vessel-wall contraction retraction and brisk bleeding 
Contraction is probably only important in the larger arteries and no contraction or retraction is seen when a vein is transected  Immediately following transection of the blood vessel there is accumulation of platelets on the exposed connective tissues at the edge of the wound 
This is seen as a greyish-white accumulation of material which grows and obstructs blood flow  Eventually bleeding stops but may restart through channels in the platelet plug which are then occluded again 
The haemostatic plug protrudes from the vessel and the blood behind the plug becomes stagnant  Histological studies of platelet plug formation have been performed in animals and in biopsies of human skin followed bleeding time studies Sixma & Wester 1977 Wester et al 1979 
The earliest finding is the platelet adhesion to collagen fibres followed by aggregation and formation of a platelet plug  There is some fibrin formed at the edges of the wound and at the plug periphery but no fibrin is seen within the plug for about 15â€“30 minutes 
In the first minute of the plug formation the platelets retain their granules and remain loosely packed  However subsequently they become more closely packed and release their granules and the plug becomes a dense mass of interdigitated platelets 
The major changes to the plugs in the hours following transection of the vessel are that lytic areas initially seen at the edges of the plug also develop in its centre and the degranulated platelets resemble empty vesicles  The pseudopodia disappear and the platelets appear round once more Wester et al 1979 
In addition there is increased fibrin formation with masses of fibrin between the platelets eventually forming a network of thick strands after 24 hours Hovig et al 1968  The platelet plays an important role in interacting with the coagulation system and certain intrinsic coagulation reactions occur preferentially on the platelet surface which appears to protect coagulation enzymes from inactivation by plasma proteinases and localises fibrin formation within and around the platelet plug Walsh 1981 
Fibrin deposition strengthens the platelet plug and the haemostatic barrier is complete  There is also infiltration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells in the wound and sometimes in the plug itself and interestingly along the blood vessel near the wound Wester et al 1979 
As can be seen from the above description the formation of the haemostatic plug or primary haemostasis involves many properties of platelets including adhesion aggregation degranulation and release reaction and these platelet properties will be briefly described  It is thought that the platelet is necessary for the maintenance of normal vascular integrity in that patients with thrombocytopaenia show a generalised haemorrhagic tendency and bruising when the platelet count falls below about 5 Ã— 10 9 /1 spontaneous bruising and more severe bleeding being possible as the platelet count falls below 20 Ã— 10 9 /1 
In addition haemorrhage can also occur due to qualitative platelet defects such as essential thrombocythaemia  The mechanism for the maintenance of this functional integrity is yet to be established but presumably would involve platelet adhesion to the endothelium 
Platelets do not usually adhere to normal endothelium but the reasons why normal endothelium is inert with respect to stimulating platelet adhesion and aggregation is not fully understood Shattil & Bennett 1981  However Moncada et al 1976a demonstrated that endothelial cells were capable of producing a potent anti-platelet aggregatory agent and it was subsequently suggested that continuous production of this substance now called prostacyclin explained the apparent protection against adhesion and aggregation conferred by the normal endothelium Moncada & Vane 1979 
Subsequent experimental work has cast doubt on this suggestion  For instance in the rabbit doses of aspirin sufficient to inhibit prostacyclin production do not lead to platelet adhesion to intact endothelium Dejana et al 1980 
In addition several studies have demonstrated that the amounts of prostacyclin normally found in the circulation are probably too low to have an appreciable effect on platelets Steer et al 1980 Haslam & McClenaghan 1981 Greaves & Preston 1982 and endothelial cells in culture produce little prostacyclin unless stimulated by thrombin for instance Weksler et al 1977  Platelets will adhere to a variety of surfaces both artificial and naturally occurring the most important in vivo is the adhesion to collagen which occurs when the blood-vessel endothelium is damaged 
This will be discussed later in this chapter  Platelet aggregation or platelet-platelet stickiness can be regarded as a special case of platelet adhesion and follows adhesion of platelets to injured surfaces 
Normally as has been described aggregation is apparent in experimental wounds within seconds  Aggregation has been studied in vitro more than any other platelet activity because of the development of a simple photometric method for its measurement Born 1962 
This is based on the observation that the optical density of stirred platelet-rich plasma PRP falls as aggregates develop and returns to normal as they disperse  Aggregation in vitro which is an active process Vargaftig et al 1981 is dependent on pH temperature mechanical stirring calcium-ion concentration the concentration of platelets in the PRP and the time elapsed between the performance of the aggregation tests and the preparation of the PRP Mills 198 1 
Numerous natural and artificial substances are capable of causing platelet aggregation Table 5.1 and depending on the nature of the aggregation agent and its concentration aggregation may be reversible or irreversible and have one or two phases  Table 5.1 Platelet aggregation agents 
Adenosine diphosphate ADP was the first agent discovered that caused aggregation Gaarder et al 1961  ADP induces aggregation directly and leads to the platelet release reaction MacMillan 1966 
A single phase of aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation is seen with low concentrations of ADP  At threshold concentrations a second phase caused by ADP release from the platelets is seen and at high concentrations a single phase with irreversible aggregation is observed Hardisty et al 1970 
Primary ADP-induced aggregation requires fibrinogen Niewiarowski et al 1971 which appears to be involved in early transitory interactions between platelets Mustard et al 1978  Other plasma protein co-factors possibly adsorbed coagulation factors of the vitamin K-dependent group may also be required Miale & Kent 1975 
ADP may play a central role in the initiation of physiological platelet aggregation  This nucleotide is extruded from activated platelets and also may be derived from injured tissues and erythrocytes Bergvist & Arfos 1976 
At low concentrations of collagen platelet aggregation is dependent on the release of arachidonic acid from platelet membrane phospholipid and the subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid via the prostaglandin pathway Packham 1976  However at higher concentrations collagen also causes release of ADP from platelet granules and this is independent of the prostaglandin pathway 
For collagen to promote platelet aggregation it must possess its triple helical structure and must be present as fibrillar collagen Zucker & Borelli 1962  Adrenaline induces a biphasic response when added to platelet-rich plasma MacMillan 1966 
The first wave of aggregation induced by adrenaline is associated with uptake of calcium by platelets and it has been suggested that a localised flux of calcium into the platelet plasma membrane enables the platelets to stick together Gerrard et al 1981  Unlike other aggregating agents ADP collagen and thrombin adrenaline does not cause initial platelet shape change seen as a transient increase in optical density of platelet-rich plasma 
These other aggregating agents which cause shape change before platelet-platelet aggregation release calcium initially from an intracellular structure probably the dense tubular system so that there is an elevation in cytoplasmic calcium before plasma membrane calcium is altered Gerrard et al 1981  The mechanisms by which platelet sticks to platelet during aggregation are not fully understood 
However extracellular calcium is necessary and there is considerable evidence particularly from studies of thrombasthenic platelets that the platelet surface glycoproteins IIb and III are involved Nurden & Caen 1974 1975 Phillips & Agin 1977  More recently fibrinogen has been strongly implicated in platelet-platelet interactions 
Platelets activated by thrombin were found to produce haemagglutinin activity with fixed bovine erythrocytes Gartner et al 1980 and subsequently the same group have shown that this agglutinin is bound to platelet membranes and appears in the incubation fluid following platelet activation by thrombin Gartner et al 1980  It is highly likely that this agglutinin is fibrinogen Gartner et al 1980 Berndt & Phillips 1981 
Indeed the role of fibrinogen in platelet aggregation has been recognised for many years Born & Cross 1964 Brinkhaus et al 1965  ADP-stimulated platelets exhibit increased fibrinogen binding and the features of the binding suggested a fibrinogen receptor on the platelet membrane which required extracellular calcium Bennett & Vilaire 1979 Peerschke et al 1980 
The release of platelet-derived material and the profound biochemical and morphological changes that occur after platelet stimulation have been termed the platelet-release reaction Grette 1962  On stimulation platelets release their dense bodies Î±-granules and lysosome-like granules see Table 5.2 but the integrity of the membrane structures cytoplasm and mitochondria is preserved 
Initial experiments were performed on porcine platelets stimulated by thrombin but subsequently many substances secretagogues have been found to provoke platelet aggregation ADP adrenaline and collagen as well as thrombin provoked release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and nucleotides from platelets Mills et al 1968  In addition immune complexes Humphrey & Jaques 1955 arachidonic acid Kaplan et al 1979 and thromboxane A 2 Hamberg et al 1975 cause platelet release 
More recently the degranulating action of platelet-activating factor has been demonstrated Chignard et al 1979 McManus et al 1979  Some secretagogues e.g. ADP stimulate the release of certain granules dense bodies some Î±-granules but not the lysosomal granules whereas thrombin stimulates secretion of all types of granule including lysosomes Holmsen 1977 
In addition to these physiological stimuli many non-physiological stimuli stimulate platelet degranulation including calcium ionophores Gerrard et al 1974 lectins Greenberg & Jamieson 1974 and latex and viral particles Holmsen 1977  As reviewed by Skaer(1981)it is probable that there are many different types of granule 
In addition the response to various secretagogues in terms of which granules are released and to what extent varies  This suggests that platelets must possess very sophisticated intracellular control mechanisms 
Table 5.2 Subcellular localisation of secreted platelet constituents  Dense body contents are discharged through the platelet-surface membrane Skaer 1981 and this occurs from between 4 seconds and 3 minutes after addition of the secretagogue 
Mobilisation of the internal calcium occurs after 0.75â€“1.8 seconds following the addition of thrombin Feinstein 1980  Therefore the release of intracellular membrane-bound calcium precedes the onset of the stimulus-induced degranulation 
A further factor involved in the stimulus to degranulation may be the breakdown of phosphatidyl inositol with the accumulation of diglyceride Rittenhouse-Simmons 1979 1-stearoyl 2-arachidonyl diglyceride  The diglyceride may be important in promoting membrane fusion of the dense body granule with the platelet-surface membrane and also as a substrate for the formation of prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2 which are powerful degranulation stimuli Bell et al 1979 
In addition the actual breakdown of the membrane polyphospoinositides by calcium-stimulated enzymes may promote degranulation as they have highly charged polar head groups which would tend to impede membrane fusion Allan & Mitchell 1979  As has been seen the platelet Î± granules contain a large number of proteins and are very numerous in the platelet cytoplasm 
For instance Î±-granule fibrinogen forms approximately 10 per cent of the total platelet protein Holmsen & Weiss 1979  Not all Î±-granules may respond in the same way to secretory stimuli for example Zucker et al 1979 who found that over 80 per cent of platelet factor VIII-related antigen was present in the Î±-granules could only demonstrate the release of 30 per cent of this in response to stimulation with collagen 
Similar findings have also been described for fibronectin Ginsberg et al 1979  Although there are several possible explanations for these findings as reviewed by Skaer 1981 it is possible that some Î±-granules may remain refractory to secretory stimuli 
The contents of the Î±-granules unlike those of the dense bodies are discharged into the open canalicular system  Î±-granule nucleoids have been demonstrated by electronmicroscopic studies in the canalicular system White 1974 and it is likely that normal secretion involves not only fusion of these granules with the canalicular system but also platelet contraction 
The evidence for this is derived from the use of differing secretagogues Gerrard et al 1974  Over recent years there has been increasing interest in these widely distributed and biologically important compounds and their importance in platelet biochemistry and platelet-vessel wall interactions has been emphasised 
The prostaglandins and thromboxanes are produced from certain 20-carbon atom polyunsaturated fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation  The most abundant of these acids in human tissue is arachidonic acid Crawford 1983 
Most arachidonic acid is esterified in membrane phospholipid complexes and in order to act as a substrate for the enzyme complex prostaglandin synthetase the free acid must be liberated by the action of phospholipase A 2  The activity of this membrane enzyme thus provides the first control step in the prostaglandin pathway by limiting the availability of arachidonic acid substrate Figure 5.2 
Figure 5.2 The prostaglandin pathway Arachidonic acid AA prostaglandin PG thromboxane TX  Free arachidonic acid is then acted upon by the system of microsomal enzymes known as prostaglandin synthetase which is composed of cyclo-oxygenase and peroxidase activities 
In the presence of molecular oxygen the cyclo-oxygenase activity converts arachidonic acid to a 15-hydroperoxide endoperoxide known as prostaglandin G 2 which is then converted by the peroxidase activity to a 15-hydroxy endoperoxide known as prostaglandin H 2 Lands 1979 see Figure 5.2  Prostaglandin H 2 is an unstable compound which has a half-life of approximately five minutes and once formed is rapidly transformed either enzymically or non-enzymically to the classical prostaglandins prostaglandin D 2 E 2 and F&sub2Î± 
Most tissues are capable of synthesizing these unstable endoperoxides and prostaglandins and it is products formed further along the prostaglandin pathway which determine the biological effects observed in different tissues  The synthesis of the prostaglandins E 2 and F&sub2Î± was demonstrated in platelets stimulated with thrombin by Smith and Willis 1971 
These authors found that oral administration of aspirin was associated with inhibition of platelet prostaglandin synthesis and suggested that this finding might explain the known effects of aspirin in inhibiting the platelet-release reaction and in prolonging the bleeding time Quick 1966  However it was difficult to accept this concept as the prostaglandins measured were not proaggregatory 
This was resolved a short time later when an unstable product of a short-term incubation of arachidonic acid with cyclo-oxygenase prepared from the vesicular gland of sheep was found to induce platelet aggregation Willis & Kuhn 1973  This product was subsequently found to be prostaglandin H 2 and the unstable endoperoxides prostaglandin G 2 and prostaglandin H 2 were found to be released during platelet aggregation Hamberg et al 1974 
In addition when these compounds were added to platelets they provoked aggregation Hamberg & Samuelsson 1974 Hamberg et al 1974  Platelet aggregation induced by endoperoxides appeared to be greater than that which could be accounted for by the endoperoxides alone and Hamberg et al 1975 were able to demonstrate that in platelets endoperoxides are further metabolised to a very unstable compound thromboxane A 2 
Thromboxane A 2 has a half-life of 30 seconds at body temperature and degrades spontaneously to the stable metabolite thromboxane B 2 Hamberg et al 1975  Subsequently the microsomal fractions of human platelets have been shown to contain an enzyme which converts the endoperoxides prostaglandin G 2 and H 2 to thromboxane A 2 and the enzyme has been designated thromboxane synthetase Needleman et al 1976 
Thromboxane synthetase also catalyses the conversion of prostaglandin H 2 to a C-17 hydroxy acid known as 12-hydroxy-5.8.10-hepta-decatrienoic acid and malondialdehyde Diczfalusy & Hammarstrom 1977  However prostaglandin H 2 conversion to these compounds may also occur non-enzymically Van Dorp et al 1978 
It appears from experiments in which platelet-membrane fractions have been separated that thromboxane synthesis is associated with intracellular membranes known as dense tubular membranes Carey et al 1982  Platelets can also metabolise arachidonic acid by a lipoxygenase enzyme system to yield a variety of hydroxy acids via their respective hydroperoxide intermediates Hamberg & Samuelsson 1974 Nugteren 1975 
The biological activity of these compounds remains to be determined  However 12-L-hydroperoxy-5,8,10 14-eicosatetraenoic acid may inhibit prostacyclin synthetase and cyclo-oxygenase Siegel et al 1979 
In 1976 a new relatively inactive arachidonic acid metabolite characterised as 6-oxo-prostaglandin F 1Î± was isolated from several tissues including guinea-pig lung Dawson et al 1976  In the same year Moncada et al 1976a reported the presence of an enzyme in aortic tissue which converted prostaglandin endoperoxides to a potent unstable inhibitor of platelet aggregation 
This factor also relaxed arterial smooth muscle and was named prostaglandin X Moncada et al 1976 a  Prostaglandin X rapidly lost activity in neutral and acidic media with the formation of a relatively inert substance subsequently identified as 6-oxo-prostaglandin F&sub1Î± and prostaglandin X was identified as 9-deoxy-6 9-epoxy-Î” 5 -prostaglandin F&sub1Î± and renamed prostacyclin Johnson et al 1976 
The microsomal enzyme converting prostaglandin H 2 to prostacyclin was named prostacyclin synthetase and prostacyclin was found to be the major product of arachidonic acid in the walls of arteries and veins in several animal species and man Moncada & Vane 1978  However prostacyclin synthetase although present in many tissues is not present in platelets Moncada & Vane 1979 
Thromboxane A 2 is a more powerful pro-aggregatory substance in platelets than the endoperoxides and it has been proposed that it is the arachidonic acid metabolite that mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction Hamberg et al 1975  Whether platelet endo-peroxides have a proaggregatory role in their own right or only when converted to thromboxane A 2 has been the subject of many studies Bunting et al 1983 
However from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are activated and the prostaglandin cascade is triggered by release of endogenous arachidonic acid then the endoperoxides generated exert their proaggregatory effects by their conversion to the more potent compound thromboxane A 2  However when the thromboxane generation is suppressed it is probable that endoperoxides can be proaggregatory themselves Bunting et al 1983 
It has been proposed that endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2 activate platelets by acting as calcium ionophores hence mobilising intracellular free calcium Gerrard et al 1978  However all prostaglandins that induce platelet aggregation cause a monophasic reversible primary response at low concentrations and a monophasic irreversible secondary response at high concentrations 
In this way the activation of platelets by prostaglandins resembles that produced by ADP and adrenaline  This is unlike the activation induced by the powerful stimulus of calcium ionophores in that prostaglandins induce platelet dense body secretion and Î±-granule secretion but not secretion of lysosomal hydrolases MacIntyre 1979 
For this reason and others reviewed by MacIntyre 1981 including studies with antagonists desensitisation experiments and measurement of calcium ionophore activity it is thought that platelet activation by prostaglandins and thromboxanes is receptor-mediated although a suitable radiolabelled ligand is not available for definitive demonstration MacIntyre 1981  Defreyn et al 1981 have demonstrated a deficiency of thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation in platelets from a patient with a familial bleeding tendency thus emphasizing the importance of thromboxane production in the physiology of platelet function 
Thromboxane A 2 is a powerful vasoactive compound and the activity of the rabbit aorta-contracting substance released from sensitized guinea-pig lungs described by Piper and Vane 1969 is accounted for by this substance Hamberg et al 1975  Because of its highly unstable nature various thromboxane A 2 -generating systems have to be used in order to study its vasoactive properties 
Using these techniques it has been shown that thromboxane A 2 is a potent contractor of isolated vessel segments from several species including coronary arteries from pig and cattle human umbilical artery and rabbit aorta Moncada & Vane 1979  In addition strips of bovine cerebral conductance arteries and human basilar arteries contract with thromboxane A 2 Boullin et al 1979 Ellis et al 1979 
The effect of thromboxane A 2 on differing vascular preparations has also been studied in vivo using thromboxane synthesized in vitro by incubations of endoperoxide with platelet microsomes  Using this technique Dusting et al 1978 were able to show short-term vasoconstriction in femoral and vascular beds of the dog following injection of the thromboxane close to the vessels 
Prostacyclin has powerful metabolic effects on blood platelets  It has the most potent effect of the naturally occurring prostaglandins in inhibiting platelet aggregation being 30â€“40 times more potent than prostaglandin E 1 and 10 times more potent than prostaglandin D 2 in vitro Gryglewski et al 1976 Moncada et al 1976a 
Prostacyclin can also bring about disaggregation of platelet aggregates in vitro Moncada et al 1976a Ubatuba et al 1979  In addition using animal models prostacyclin applied locally has been shown to inhibit thrombus formation in response to ADP in the hamster cheek pouch microcirculation Higgs et al 1977 and given systemically prostacyclin inhibited thrombus formation induced electrically in rabbit carotid artery Ubatuba et al 1979 
Similar findings were observed with prostacyclin either applied locally or given systemically in the coronary artery of dog Aiken et al 1979  When given systemically prostacyclin protected against sudden death secondary to platelet aggregation in the rabbit following intravenous injection of arachidonic acid Bayer et al 1979 
Gryglewski et al 1978 incorporated collagen strips into extracorporeal circuits in animals and showed that prostacyclin brought about disaggregation of platelet aggregates formed on the collagen strips  Similarly prostacyclin inhibited platelet aggregation on rabbit subendothelium but only prevented platelet adhesion at higher doses Higgs et al 1978 
In man prostacyclin infusion inhibited platelet aggregation measured ex vivo at a threshold dosage of 2 ng/kg/min and with increasing doses there was increased inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation Fitzgerald et al 1981  Although platelets can not synthesize prostacyclin they do possess the enzyme 9-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase Wong et al 1980 
This enzyme can transform 6-oxo-prostaglandin F&sub1Î± the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin into 6-oxo-prostaglandin E 1 which does possess antiaggregatory effects Quilley et al 1980  However the possible biological role of this metabolite in platelet function remains to be determined as plasma levels of 6-oxo-prostaglandin E 1 measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques did not increase following intravenous infusion of prostacyclin Jackson et al 1982 
The potent inhibitory action of prostacyclin on platelet aggregation correlates with its ability to stimulate the platelet adenylate cyclase system thus increasing cyclic AMP levels within the cell Tateson et al 1977  Stimulation of adenylate cyclase follows binding of prostacyclin to a platelet membrane receptor which it shares with prostaglandin E 1 but is distinct from the prostaglandin D 2 receptor Miller & Gorman 1979 
Shepherd et al 1983 have calculated that each human platelet has 4200 high-affinity binding sites for prostacyclin with a dissociation constant of 16 nmol  In keeping with its stronger anti-platelet aggregatory effects compared to prostaglandin E 1 prostacyclin stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity is more potent and more sustained Gorman et al 1977 
By enhancing platelet cyclic AMP levels through its stimulation of adenylate cyclase prostacyclin can reduce cytoplasmic calcium levels which determine platelet shape change aggregation and the release reaction KÃ¤ser-Glanzmann et al 1977  In addition platelet phospholipase A2 Minkes et al 1977 and cyclo-oxygenase Malmsten et al 1976 are inhibited by the elevated cyclic AMP levels 
Prostacyclin is the major product of arachidonic acid metabolism in blood vessels and the synthesis is highest in the intima Moncada et al 1977  Capillaries also generate prostacyclin Goehlert et al 1981 and studies with cultured cells have demonstrated that it is endothelial cells which are the main source Weksler et al 1977 
Thus when endothelium was stripped from rabbit aorta in vivo prostacyclin production at the luminal surface of the vessel was virtually absent and recovery of prostacyclin production was slow over a period of 70 days coinciding with the appearance of neointimal cells Eldor et al 1981  Prostacyclin in contrast to thromboxane A 2 produced relaxation in most arterial preparations tested in vitro and was a potent vasodilator when tested in isolated perfused heart preparations reviewed by Moncada and Vane 1979 
In addition Dusting et al 1979 demonstrated increased blood flow in the coronary arteries of the intact heart in open-chested dogs following application of prostacyclin  Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator in the microcirculation as demonstrated using the hamster cheek pouch preparation by Higgs et al 1982 and in the cerebral microcirculation of the cat by Ellis et al 1979 
In intact experimental animals prostacyclin has a vasodepressor effect and this was observed to an equal degree when injected intravenously or intra-arterially Armstrong et al 1978  This work suggests that prostacyclin is not inactivated in the pulmonary circulation unlike other prostaglandins 
However the vascular activity of prostacyclin in vivo is very short-lived and is less than its chemical half-life at physiological temperature and pH i.e. < three minutes  This suggests that biological inactivation takes place very rapidly in vivo and that most metabolites of prostacyclin have little vasodepressor activity apart from 6-oxo-prostaglandin El reviewed by Whittle and Moncada 1983 
Platelets are undoubtedly involved in the final occlusion of atheromatous arteries and form the major component the white head of aggregated platelets of the occlusive thrombus Davies & Thomas 1981  This sudden and often catastrophic event is most likely precipitated by fissuring of an underlying atheromatous plaque as detailed analysis of obstructed coronary arteries at postmortem invariably shows that the thrombus is found in association with haemorrhage into a plaque 
Chapman 1965 Constantinides 1966 Friedman 1970  In addition to their apparent central role in the pathogenesis of the arterial thrombus increasing interest has focussed on platelets and the coronary microcirculation with the finding of platelet aggregates in the coronary microcirculation in some cases of sudden cardiac death Haerem 1972 El-Maraghi & Genton 1980 
These findings have stimulated an increasing amount of research into the mechanisms involved yet the pathogenesis of thrombus formation remains to be clarified  Certainly platelets do not normally adhere to arterial endothelium if it is not damaged but the explanation for this antithrombotic property of intact endothelium remains obscure 
Following the discovery of prostacyclin it was suggested that endothelial cell production of this very potent antiaggregatory substance might explain this important property Moncada et al 1977 Moncada & Vane 1978  However this suggestion has not been confirmed experimentally as has been discussed previously 
Platelets will rapidly adhere and aggregate if the endothelial barrier is breached as has been shown in many studies in experimental animals reviewed by Mustard et al 1983 and platelets adherent to collagen release the contents of their Î± and dense granules  Fissuring of an atherosclerotic plaque would also expose collagen fibres and the adhering platelets could release agents such as thromboxane A 2 and ADP which would rapidly lead to adhesion and aggregation of more platelets and growth of the thrombus 
In addition prostacyclin generation is probably reduced in the region of the atherosclerotic plaque possibly due to the high content of lipid peroxides in advanced atherosclerotic lesions Glavind et al 1952  It is known that fatty acid peroxides inhibit prostacyclin generation Moncada et al 1976 b Salmon et al 1978 
Thus the production of prostacyclin by cultured smooth muscle cells obtained from plaques of the experimental atherosclerotic rabbit consistently produced less prostacyclin when compared to control cells Larrue et al 1980  Furthermore prostacyclin production measured by bioassay and 6-oxo-prostaglandin F&sub1Î± concentrations was reduced in perfused heart preparations from atherosclerotic rabbits Dembinska-Kiec et al 1977 
Similarly prostacyclin production in human atherosclerotic tissue appears to be reduced  Sinzinger et al 1979 demonstrated decreased prostacyclin generation from atherosclerotic tissue compared to normal arterial tissue and could find no difference between early and advanced lesions 
D'Angelo et al 1978 found no prostacyclin generation in atheromatous plaques from three subjects  In addition to the probable decreased prostacyclin production in the region of the atheromatous plaque possibly due to inhibition of prostacyclin synthetase by lipid peroxides it is known that certain fatty acid hydroperoxides also induce platelet aggregation Mickel & Horbar 1974 
Thus diminution of prostacyclin production and stimulation of platelet aggregation both mediated by lipid peroxides could contribute to thrombosis on atheromatous plaques  Increased thromboxane A 2 production may also contribute to thrombogenesis in atherosclerotic vessels 
Thus platelet thromboxane A 2 production measured as the stable degradation form thromboxane B 2 is increased in patients with arterial or venous thrombosis Lagarde & Dechavanne 1977 and myocardial infarction Szczeklik et al 1978  Similarly following acute ligation of the coronary artery in dogs high levels of thromboxane B 2 were found to be associated with cardiac arrhythmias Coker et al 1981 
In addition thromboxane B 2 levels were found to be elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with Prinzmetal angina Lewy et al 1979 Robertson et al 1981 and in coronary sinus blood of patients with unstable angina Hirsh et al 1981  Although the above description of experimental findings would suggest that exposure of collagen and lipid peroxides due to rupture of the atheromatous plaque could be of importance in thrombogenesis together with enhanced platelet thromboxane A 2 formation and diminished vessel wall prostacyclin formation Born has questioned this series of events Born 1983 
He has pointed out that platelet aggregates grow very rapidly and although platelet adhesion to collagen is almost instantaneous there is a lag period several seconds before aggregation proceeds Wilner et al 1969  In addition mural platelet thrombi can occur during passage of anticoagulated blood through artificial extracorporeal systems Richardson et al. 
1976 which suggests that under certain circumstances collagen or other vessel wall constituents are unnecessary for activation of platelets  Born has assembled evidence to suggest that the important trigger to thrombogenesis in vivo is ADP and that at sites of vascular injury enough ADP is released from damaged cells to initiate thrombogenesis Born 1983 
Whatever the physiological stimulus to platelet aggregation and thrombus formation it appears that it is the fissuring of an atheromatous plague often with extrusion of plaque lipid contents which triggers thrombus formation Bouch & Montgomery 1970  The nature of this obviously very important event remains unclear 
However a possible explanation has been put forward by Brooks et al 1971 which proposes that softening of the atheromatous plaque may be due to the presence of unusual lipids cholesteryl esters of hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid found in high concentrations in ulcerated plaques Harland et al 1971 which are thought to produce smooth muscle cell necrosis at the base of the plaque  As has been discussed above platelets are a crucial factor in thrombogenesis associated with atheromatous arteries 
However over recent years the possible role of platelets in the early stages of the atheromatous process has been emphasised Ross & Glomset 1976  Of course the advanced atherosclerotic plaque is a very complex structure but the early lesion is very much a process which involves the intima of the artery and is characterised by proliferation of smooth muscle cells which have migrated from the media of the artery Woolf 1983 
The fact that this early lesion is intimal suggests a response to a factor or factors in the blood and the response to injury hypothesis is central to current thinking on the atherosclerotic process  It was Virchow in the middle of the nineteenth century who first put forward the concept of arterial wall injury leading to the development of the atheromatous plaque 
In the middle of the twentieth century Duguid 1946 emphasised the importance of arterial thrombi in the genesis of the plaque and pointed out that it was Rokitansky who first put forward the encrustation hypothesis  The role of platelets in the process which has resulted from the work of several groups Chandler & Hand 1961 Murphy et al 1962 French 1966 Ross et al 1974 as put forward by Ross and Glomset 1976 is really a bringing together of the Virchow and Rokitansky hypotheses of more than a century ago in that platelets may themselves contribute to vessel injury thrombosis and atherogenesis Mustard et al 1983 
The functions of the endothelial cells of the arterial intima have been reviewed by Majno and Joris 1978 who highlighted several important aspects of endothelial cell physiology  These included a barrier function to the formed elements of blood and plasma macromolecules resistance to platelet thrombi active transport of substances from blood synthesis of factors involved in vessel wall-blood interactions and vascular repair processes 
Thus endothelial cells synthesise many elements of their underlying connective tissue including fibronectin elastin collagen proteoglycans and microfibrils Buonassisi 1973 Howard et al 1976 Jaffe et al 1976 Bornstein & Sage 1980 which controls vessel permeability as well as stimulating thrombosis following loss or damage to endothelial cells Smith et al 1979  Exchange of macromolecules across the endothelium involves active vesicle formation and transendothelial channels and intercellular clefts Simionescu et al 1976 Chien 1978 
The resistance of intact endothelium to platelet aggregation does not solely depend on its ability to synthesize prostacyclin as has been discussed previously  Other factors which may be involved in this important property are secretion of plasminogen activator Loskutoff & Edgington 1977 a membrane-associated ADPase Lieberman et al 1977 the presence of heparin-like membrane proteoglycans Thorgeirsson & Robertson 1978 the ability to take up and degrade vasoactive amines Johnson & Erdos 1977 the uptake and clearance of circulating thrombin Lollar & Owen 1980 and surface charge Sawyer & Srinivasan 1973 
From the above description it can be seen that the endothelial cell has many important properties and endothelial damage is proposed as the initial event in the response to injury hypothesis  In the postulated series of events breach of the endothelial barrier would expose sub-endothelial smooth muscle cells and connective tissue to plasma constituents including lipoproteins platelets and macrophage-type mononuclear cells Harker & Ross 1979 
Following endothelial injury platelets would adhere to the injured site form microthrombi and release their granular contents which include a potent Î±-granule-derived mitogen that stimulates migration and focal proliferation of intimal and medial smooth muscle cells Ross & Vogel 1978  Subsequently there would be synthesis of collagen elastin and proteoglycans by smooth muscle cells intracellular and extracellular lipid accumulation and thrombosis associated with the lesion 
Support for this sequence of events has come from animal models of atherosclerosis and studies using cell-culture techniques and as Born 1983 has pointed out caution is necessary in translating these findings to the human situation  However there does seem to be considerable evidence linking platelets to the development of proliferative arterial intimal lesions following experimental removal of endothelium in animal experiments either mechanically or chemically reviewed by Mustard et al 1983 
In addition the emerging information regarding the properties of the platelet-derived growth factor argues for an important role in the atherogenic process of this platelet Î±-granule constituent  Platelet-derived growth factor has been highly purified and appears to consist of two polypeptide chains of molecular weight 14000â€“17000 covalently joined by disulphide bonds reviewed by Bowen-Pope and Ross 1984 
Following its purification it has been possible to study the biological properties of platelet-derived growth factor  Important amongst these properties are its ability to induce chemotaxis by vascular smooth muscle cells Grotendorst et al 1982 fibroblasts SeppÃ¤ et al 1982 and monocytes Deuel et al 1982 increase rates of fluid phase pinocytosis Davies & Ross 1978 and protein synthesis Owen et al 1982 increase the number of LDL receptors Chait et al 1980 and somatomedin receptors Clemmons et al 1980 as well as stimulate proliferation of connective tissue cells 
It remains to be seen whether cells can respond to platelet-derived growth factor in vivo and at the moment its role in atherogenesis remains speculative but attractive  As has been discussed the response to injury hypothesis depends on initial endothelial injury and little is known about loss of endothelium in vivo either spontaneously or in response to risk factors for atherosclerosis 
Although endothelial replication is increased in response to hypertension or hyperlipidaemia Florentin et al 1969 Schwartz et al 1980 this does not necessarily imply that the arterial intima is denuded of endothelium  In addition studies with the electronmicroscope have not shown significant areas of denuded intima in early hyperlipidaemia in animal models despite there being increased endothelial turnover Taylor et al 1978 
These findings have led to the suggestion that altered endothelial function without endothelial loss may be important in permitting platelet thrombus formation  In this regard Gryglewski et al 1978 showed that prostacyclin formation in segments of blood vessel from cholesterol-fed monkeys was reduced 
These authors on the basis of these experiments suggested a primary role for prostacyclin deficiency in the development of atherosclerosis in these animals  However this suggestion depends on the assumption that prostacyclin is continually produced by arterial wall to prevent platelet aggregation 
This assumption is not tenable as it is now recognised that the unstimulated output of prostacyclin by blood vessels is low reviewed by Dollery et al 1983  However factors that reduce the ability of the vascular endothelium to produce prostacyclin may impair the ability of the vessel to respond to vascular injury Dollery et al 1983 
Recent work Faggiotto & Ross 1984 Faggiotto et al 1984 has cast more light on the response to injury hypothesis in cholesterol-fed monkeys  These workers have emphasised that the initial lesion in this model of atherogenesis is the adherence to endothelium of monocytes which then appear to migrate into the subendothelium accumulate lipid and become lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells 
It was only after some months that endothelial denudation was observed with platelet mural thrombus attached to exposed lipid-containing macrophages  These authors postulate that in as yet an unexplained way it is the accumulation of these lipid-laden foam cells in the sub-endothelium that damage the endothelium thus allowing the subsequent developments in the formation of the atheromatous plaque to proceed 
Despite increasing numbers of research communications concerned with platelet function in the diabetic there remain many conflicting reports and unresolved questions  Many factors contribute to this unsatisfactory situation 
For instance there is no absolutely satisfactory test of platelet function  Many studies have been performed using in vitro tests and it is difficult to be certain of the relevance of these tests to platelet function in vivo 
Platelets are studied in an artificial environment and the very process of preparing the platelet sample for study may affect their behaviour  However there is no doubt that the development of the turbidometric method for the study of platelet aggregation in vitro Born 1962 gave tremendous impetus to the study of platelet function 
In more recent years as understanding of platelet physiology has increased newer tests have been applied to the study of platelets from diabetic subjects which may be more relevant to platelet function in vivo  It has become possible to measure plasma levels of Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 which are specific platelet proteins Niewiarowski 1977 Moore et al 1975 
They are stored within platelet Î±-granules Niewiarowski 1977 and are released to the surrounding plasma during platelet aggregation induced by thrombin collagen ADP adrenaline and various lectins Holmsen et al 1969,1975  Î²-Thromboglobulin MW 35 000 is the most abundant specific platelet protein and its platelet concentration is 30â€“104 times higher than in other tissues Ludlam 1979 
Since it is cleared from human plasma with a half-life of 100 minutes Dawes et al 1978 an elevated plasma Î²-thromboglobulin level may be a useful indicator of enhanced in vivo platelet activation and release reaction  Platelet factor 4 has a very short half-life Musial et al 1980 compared to Î²-thromboglobulin which therefore makes it less sensitive for the detection of the in vivo platelet-release reaction but it is a useful measure of artefactual in vitro secretion during and after blood sampling Kaplan & Owen 1981 
In recent years the importance of the prostaglandin pathway in platelets in relation to platelet aggregation has become apparent and several studies have attempted to assess the activity of this pathway in platelets from diabetic subjects  In addition prostaglandin metabolism may play a crucial role in the interaction between platelets and vascular endothelium and several studies have examined the effect of the diabetic state on prostacyclin synthesis and the balance between prostacyclin and thromboxane 
Further attempts to estimate platelet function in vivo have involved isotopic labelling of platelets and measurement of platelet survival and assessments of platelet aggregation in whole blood  However all these tests have potential limitations and results must be interpreted with caution 
In addition to problems intrinsic to the methodology of platelet function problems also arise from the diabetic groups studied  Many of the early studies of platelet function in diabetic subjects failed to take into account other factors known to influence platelet function particularly the presence or absence of diabetic vascular complications 
This has led to difficulties in interpretation of the possible sequence of events in the development of enhanced platelet reactivity in diabetics  In other words are observed platelet abnormalities related to the disturbed metabolic state of diabetes or are they secondary to the presence of vascular disease 
More recent studies have attempted to overcome this problem by electively studying diabetics free from clinical evidence of vascular disease  However it is difficult to be completely sure of the absence of vascular disease on clinical grounds alone and for this reason some groups have studied platelet function in diabetic children and adolescents in whom vascular disease would be unlikely 
Early studies of platelet function in diabetes used in vitro tests of platelet adhesion  A variety of techniques were used involving glass beads or fibres in a column 
Anticoagulated blood or platelet-rich plasma was passed through the column at a fixed flow rate and platelet counts were performed before and after exposure to these foreign surfaces the difference being the number of platelets adhering  In general these techniques are tricky and difficult to reproduce and conflicting results were reported 
Whereas increased platelet adhesion was reported in diabetics with evidence of microvascular and macrovascular disease Mayne et al 1970 no increase in adhesion was found in diabetics with retinopathy Heath et al 1971  However the majority of studies did show increased adhesiveness in diabetic subjects with Valdorf-Hansen 1967 Badawi et al 1970 Hellem 1971 and without Shaw et al 1967 Hellem 1971 vascular disease 
For in vitro aggregation studies citrated blood is carefully centrifuged to produce platelet-rich plasma  Aliquots of platelet-rich plasma are then placed in an aggregometer and stirred at 37Â°C 
Various agonists for example ADP collagen adrenaline and thrombin are then added to the platelet-rich plasma to induce aggregation which is measured as a change in optical density  Studies of in vitro aggregation in diabetics date from the late sixties and early seventies 
These early studies were performed in diabetics with and without clinical evidence of vascular disease  However as Colwell et al have pointed out Colwell et al 1983 if enhanced platelet aggregation were to contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease then evidence of it should be present before the development of vascular disease 
Later studies have taken care to define the diabetic population studied in terms of the presence or absence of complications  Increased platelet aggregation has been reported in patients with neuropathy O'Malley et al 1975 retinopathy Heath et al 1971 Bensoussan et al 1975 and coronary artery disease Szirtes 1970 
However conflicting findings have appeared  For instance in a study of 25 retinopathy patients the marker most commonly used for microvascular disease platelets exhibited enhanced platelet aggregation to the agonists adrenaline and arachidonic acid but not to ADP Creter et al 1978 
On the other hand platelet sensitivity to ADP was exaggerated in retinopathy patients studied by Khosla et al and was significantly greater than that in diabetics without retinopathy Khosla et al 1979  The majority of reports of platelet-aggregation studies in diabetics without clinical evidence of vascular complications have found increased aggregation to various agonists particularly ADP and collagen Sagel et al 1975 Halushka et al 1971 Stuart et al 1979 Halushka et al 1981 a Silberbauer et al 1981 Janka et al 1983 
However the occasional study has failed to demonstrate increased platelet aggregation in diabetics free of vascular disease Petersen & Gormsen 1978 Corbella et al 1979 and certainly it would appear from the studies as a whole that platelet aggregation is more enhanced in diabetics with complications  Recently a new method of measuring platelet aggregation has been described Cardinal & Flower 1980 which enables platelet aggregation in response to various agonists to be studied in whole blood 
When two electrodes are suspended in whole blood a monolayer of platelets will form and the conductance between the electrodes is constant  However further platelets aggregate to the platelet monolayer when an aggregation agent is added and an accretion of platelets occurs between the two electrodes 
This resulting increase in impedance between the electrodes may be observed on a pen recorder  This may be a more physiological approach to the study of platelet aggregation as platelets are studied immediately after blood sampling in the presence of red cells white cells and the heavier platelets that are removed by the centrifugation step in techniques using platelet-rich plasma 
These cells may be important modulators of platelet function in vivo through their ability to take up adenine nucleotides and synthesize and release regulatory prostaglandins Roos & Pfleger 1972 Blackwell et al 1978  In addition important regulators of platelet function such as prostacyclin and cyclic AMP may have been degraded to inactive products during the time taken to prepare platelet-rich plasma 
This technique has been applied to the study of platelet function in diabetic subjects Jones et al 1985  In response to the agonist arachidonic acid 1 mM which acts via the prostaglandin pathway and collagen 1 Î¼g/ml which acts partly directly by adhesion and also via prostaglandin synthesis whole blood samples from the diabetic subjects showed increased platelet aggregation 
No significant differences were seen with the higher dose of collagen 5 Î¼g/ml probably because the impedance aggregometer is more sensitive to smaller platelet aggregates than to the larger aggregates which would have been induced by the high-dose collagen Ingerman-Wojenski et al 1982  The diabetics chosen for this study were free of clinical evidence of vascular disease which suggests that the platelet abnormalities in this diabetic group were due to the diabetic state Jones et al 1985 
Several studies have attempted to assess whether there is evidence of increased circulating platelet aggregates in diabetic subjects  The platelet aggregate ratio as described by Wu and Hoak 1974 depends on the ratio of the platelet count performed on platelet-rich plasma derived from blood mixed with formalin to that in platelet-rich plasma prepared without formalin 
Formalin fixes platelet aggregates which would be removed during the centrifugation to produce platelet-rich plasma  Therefore the platelet-aggregate ratio would be low in the presence of circulating platelet aggregates 
It is important to remember that other factors may affect the platelet-aggregate ratio such as the rate at which blood is drawn through the sampling needle Rohrer et al 1978  However Davis et al demonstrated that a group of 15 insulin-dependent diabetics without clinical evidence of complications had a significantly reduced platelet aggregate ratio of 0.75 Â± 0.6 Â± s.d. compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects with a ratio of 0.91 + 0.11 Davis et al 1982 
No difference in the platelet-aggregate ratio was found between a group of 15 diabetics diagnosed after the age of 30 years six treated with insulin some of whom had vascular complications compared to age- and sex-matched controls  No details were given of the glycaemic control or other metabolic parameters of the two groups of diabetics studied Davis et al 1982 and it is difficult to account for these findings 
Dettori et al 1983 assessed the platelet-aggregate ratio in 92 adult onset diabetics and compared the results to 50 control subjects of a similar age  No differences were observed in the diabetic group as a whole compared to controls 
However when the patients were divided into those with good control HbA lc <9 per cent and bad control HbA lc <9 per cent it was found that the group with poor control had a significantly reduced platelet-aggregate ratio  Along with this there was a highly significant inverse relationship between platelet-aggregate ratio and HbA lc 
No such correlation was seen with various parameters of lipid metabolism Dettori et al 1983  In a further study of the platelet-aggregate ratio in diabetic subjects Preston et al found a significant reduction in the diabetic group and this was due mainly to those diabetics with evidence of microvascular complications Preston et al 1978 
The above studies have attempted to assess the presence of circulating platelet aggregates  Other studies have measured spontaneous platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma and whole blood in vitro using a variety of techniques but mostly involving agitation by stirring 
The platelet aggregates formed in this way are fixed with formol  It is difficult to assess the significance of spontaneous platelet aggregation that is platelet aggregation induced by stirring alone without the addition of an aggregatory agent 
However the phenomenon is unusual in healthy individuals and it is conceivable that circulation stresses may have similar effects on platelets in vivo  Studies of this kind have demonstrated increased spontaneous in vitro platelet aggregation in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects free from vascular disease Krzywanek & Breddin 1981 Paulsen et al 1981 Silberbauer et al 1981 
Initial reports of Î²-thromboglobulin levels in diabetic subjects were conflicting  Whereas in one study no significant increase in Î²-thromboglobulin was found Campbell et al 1977 other studies revealed higher levels of Î²-thromboglobulin in diabetic patients Burrows et al 1978 Preston et al 1978 
It has been suggested that the different findings in these studies were due to the different techniques applied to the collection of blood samples  In the study of Campbell et al blood samples were collected into plastic tubes containing PGE 1 in addition to EDTA and theophylline Campbell et al 1977 
In the other studies PGE 1 was not present in the sample tubes Burrows et al 1978  However it is now generally accepted that Î²-thromboglobulin levels are elevated in diabetics Davis et al 1979 and further evidence came from a large study of Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 in diabetics compared to age- and sex-matched controls Betteridge et al 1981 
It is known that there is a significant increase in the level of Î²-thromboglobulin with age Ludlam et al 1975 Zahavi et al 1980 and a sex difference in old healthy subjects Zahavi et al 1980  Both Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 levels were significantly elevated in diabetics compared to age- and sex-matched controls Betteridge et al 1981 
Levels of Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 were highly significantly correlated both in control subjects and diabetic patients confirming that these two proteins are released from the same platelet pool and presumably at the same rate  A significant positive correlation was found between B-thromboglobulin and malondialdehyde formation in washed platelets stimulated by arachidonic acid 
Malondialdehyde is a stable end-product of the prostaglandin pathway in platelets  The significant positive correlation of Î²-thromboglobulin to platelet malondialdehyde formation suggests that the enhanced platelet-release reaction may be in part linked to increased platelet prostaglandin synthesis in diabetic subjects Betteridge et al 1981 possibly leading to generation of unstable endoperoxides and thromboxanes which are powerful inducers of platelet aggregation and release reaction Hamberg et al 1975 
Î²-Thromboglobulin levels have been shown to be elevated in various types of vascular disease  Ludlam et al 1975 found elevated levels in patients presenting with subacute venous thrombosis 
Stewart et al 1983 described significantly higher levels of platelet-specific proteins in patients with transient cerebral ischaemia and Handin et al 1978 found elevated levels in patients following myocardial infarction  Cella et al 1979 found elevated Î²-thromboglobulin levels in patients with peripheral vascular disease but not in patients with cerebro-vascular disease 
Platelet-specific protein levels have been compared in diabetics with and without clinical evidence of vascular disease Betteridge et al 1981 and although there was a more pronounced increase in diabetics with retinopathy those diabetics without clinical evidence of vascular disease still had higher levels of platelet-specific proteins than controls suggesting that the enhanced platelet activation may not just be a consequence of vascular damage but may precede its development  So far elevated levels of platelet-specific proteins have been discussed purely as a likely measure of enhanced in vivo platelet-release reaction in diabetic subjects 
However do these platelet-specific proteins have a physiological role in their own right  The important platelet mitogen platelet-derived growth factor which is an Î±-granule constituent along with Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 has been discussed earlier in this chapter 
Both Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 have antiheparin activity  However it is doubtful whether this property of the platelet-specific proteins has any physiological importance since the concentration of heparin is probably insignificant Niewiarowski & Paul 1981 
Nevertheless these proteins also react with other glycosaminoglycans such as heparin sulphate Barber et al 1972 Niewiarowski et al 1979  Heparin sulphate occurs on the surface of many cells including endothelial cells Lindahl & Hook 1978 and there is evidence that both platelet factor 4 Busch et al 1980 and Î²-thromboglobulin Hope et al 1979 bind to cultured endothelial cells 
In addition Î²-thromboglobulin appears to inhibit prostacyclin synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells Hope et al 1979  Platelet factor 4 appears to act as an inhibitor of collagenase which suggests a possible physiological role in connective tissue metabolism Hiti-Harper et al 1978 
However the possible physiological roles for Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 remain to be determined  As discussed previously prostaglandins thromboxanes and their precursor arachidonic acid are critical substances in platelet metabolism Samuelsson 1977 and there have been several studies of the activity of the prostaglandin pathway and thromboxane synthesis in platelets from diabetic subjects 
Halushka et al 1977 demonstrated that diabetic platelets synthesised greater amounts of prostaglandin E 2 in response to various agonists compared to platelets from matched control subjects  Most of the patients studied were free of clinically detectable vascular disease 
Subsequently increased serum concentrations of the prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGF&sub1Î± were demonstrated in the serum of diabetic children Chase et al 1979  Although the findings indicated increased activity of the platelet prostaglandin pathway in diabetic subjects they did not explain the increased platelet aggregation as these prostaglandins are not in themselves aggregatory 
The formation of the potent aggregating substance thromboxane A 2 in diabetic platelets has to be assessed indirectly because it is very labile with a half-life of approximately 30 seconds in aqueous solution Hamberg et al 1975  Malondialdehyde is a stable product of the conversion of endoperoxides to thromboxane A 2 by the microsomal enzyme thromboxane synthetase and is formed in equimolar amounts Diczfalusy et al 1977 
Stuart et al 1979 showed that platelets obtained from pregnant diabetic women synthesised increased amounts of malondialdehyde  In addition Betteridge et al 1981 found increased synthesis of malondialdehyde in washed platelets stimulated by arachidonic acid in 23 insulin-dependent and 25 non-insulin-dependent diabetics 20 males 28 females compared to 30 control subjects 
Forty-one per cent of these diabetics had levels of malondialdehyde formation greater than the highest result seen in the control group and this difference was highly significant Betteridge et al 1981  Thromboxane A 2 formation has also been assessed by the measurement of thromboxane B 2 by radioimmunoassay 
Thromboxane A 2 spontaneously rearranges to form thromboxane B 2 which is stable and considerably less potent Friedman et al 1979  Several studies have shown that diabetic platelets synthesise increased amounts of thromboxane A 2 as assessed by thromboxane B 2 levels Ziboh et al 1979 Butkus et al 1980 Lagarde et al 1980 Halushka et al 1981b 
Butkus et al 1980 measured thromboxane B 2 generation in response to exogenous arachidonic acid quantitated by electron-capture gas chromatography in a group of 180 insulin-dependent subjects  Although platelet thromboxane generation was elevated in diabetics without clinical evidence of vascular disease the difference did not reach statistical significance 
However those diabetics with retinopathy neuropathy nephropathy peripheral vascular disease or coronary vascular disease did show significantly enhanced platelet thromboxane generation compared to controls Butkus et al 1980  Ziboh et al 1979 also found that diabetics with complications had higher platelet thromboxane generation than diabetics without complications 
However in the study of Halushka et al 1981 b thromboxane generation appeared to be increased in diabetics without complications and evidence of increased thromboxane generation comes from studies using experimental animals for instance the spontaneously diabetic BB-Wistar rat Subbiah & Deitemeyer 1980 and the streptozotocin diabetic rat Johnson et al 1980  In addition a recent study has assessed platelet thromboxane production in insulin-dependent diabetics with and without coronary artery disease Butkus et al 1982 
Platelets from diabetics with coronary artery disease had higher thromboxane production than those without coronary disease and platelets from diabetics in general produced more thromboxane than those from non-diabetics  However those non-diabetics with coronary disease showed high thromboxane production Butkus et al 1982 
The discovery of this highly important cyclo-oxygenation product of arachidonic acid which is the most potent endogenous anti-platelet aggregatory agent known Moncada et al 1976a has stimulated interest in the possible effects of the diabetic state on its metabolism  Harrison et al 1978 found decreased prostacyclin production in aortic rings taken from severe streptozotocin diabetic rats 
This original observation has been confirmed and extended by other workers  Silberbauer et al 1980 induced a mild form of diabetes in GÃ¶ttingen miniature pigs by repeated administration of streptozotocin 
The amount of prostacyclin generated assayed by inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation by vascular tissue was significantly reduced in these mildly diabetic animals Silberbauer et al 1980  The time-course of development of reduced vascular prostacyclin production was studied by El Tahir et al 1982 
Although there was a slight reduction in aortic prostacyclin production in acutely diabetic rats diabetic for up to 15 days the differences were not statistically significant  However in chronically diabetic rats diabetic for eight weeks vascular prostacyclin was markedly reduced El Tahir et al 1982 
The reduced production of vascular prostacyclin in chronically diabetic rats studied by Harrison et al 1980 was restored to normal by chronic eight days but not acute insulin treatment  This suggests that low prostacyclin production may be a consequence of arterial endothelial cell loss or damage and this requires restoration by normalisation of metabolism for some days before prostacyclin production returns to normal Harrison et al 1980 
It is obviously difficult to study arterial prostacyclin production in diabetic subjects  However in a small study of vascular tissue removed at operation prostacyclin generation was found to be reduced in tissue from diabetics Johnson et al 1979 
Furthermore Silberbauer et al 1979 showed that vein biopsies obtained from insulin-dependent diabetics generated significantly less prostacyclin compared to age- and sex-matched controls  On the other hand Davis et al 1981 found that venous prostacyclin production was lower in a small group of diabetics with nil or minimal retinopathy compared to diabetics with proliferative retinopathy 
This finding albeit in very small numbers would seem to suggest that reduced prostacyclin production may not have a role in the development of microvascular disease  However it is likely that this finding may indicate increased prostacyclin production in response to vascular injury Dollery et al 1983 
Attempts have been made to measure plasma prostacyclin levels indirectly by radioimmunoassay measurement of 6-keto-PGF 1 Î± a stable metabolite of prostacyclin  Using this method conflicting findings have been reported in studies of diabetic subjects Dollery et al 1979 Davis et al 1981 and it is now generally accepted that there may be considerable non-specific interference in assaying this metabolite in plasma which might explain the different findings Greaves & Preston 1982 Dollery et al 1983 
Two recent studies have examined the effect of the diabetic environment on prostacyclin production by cultured human endothelial cells Paton et al 1982 a Patel et al 1983  When these cells were incubated with serum from diabetic patients prostacyclin production was inhibited 
The nature of the inhibitory factor or factors in the diabetic serum is not understood but a likely contender would be lipid peroxides which are known to inhibit prostacyclin production and to be elevated in diabetic plasma  In addition to the findings that vascular prostacyclin production may be decreased in diabetes it has been shown that platelets obtained from diabetic subjects show diminished sensitivity to the antiaggregatory effects of prostacyclin in vitro 
Onodera et al 1981 Betteridge et al 1982 Jones et al 1985  The pathogenesis of this finding is not known but it appears to be unrelated to any effect of the diabetic state on platelet prostacyclin receptors as prostacyclin binding appears to be normal in diabetic platelets Shepherd et al 1983 
The overall effect of diabetic control on platelet function remains to be clarified  Studies in this field are difficult to interpret due to the inherent variability of the measurements of platelet function 
In addition sample timing in relation to metabolic control in diabetic patients may be crucial  Hypoglycaemia as might be expected may affect platelet function substantially Hutton et al 1979 Hilsted et al 1980 presumably by stimulating the release of counter-regulatory hormones particularly adrenaline which is known to be a potent stimulus for platelet aggregation 
Thus platelet aggregation induced by ADP in vitro was enhanced following hypoglycaemia and this was associated with a fall in platelet count Hilsted et al 1980  More recently Î²-thromboglobulin has been shown to rise markedly during controlled hypoglycaemia in a group of insulin-dependent diabetics Monnier et al 1984 
This latter finding provides further evidence of the in vivo platelet activation and release reaction  Therefore it is apparent that possible stimulation of platelet function by hypoglycaemia must be borne in mind when interpreting the results of longitudinal studies of tight glycaemic control on platelet function 
Hypoglycaemia may be asymptomatic Calabrese et al 1982 but still lead to secretion of adrenaline Rizza et al 1979 and hence activation of platelets  In addition if samples for platelet function studies are taken from diabetic subjects during episodes of metabolic decompensation leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or the non-ketotic hyperosmolar syndrome then platelet aggregation and consumption may be stimulated Kwaan et al 1972 Paton 1981 
As well as these acute metabolic derangements found in diabetes producing acute effects on platelet function other factors known to influence platelet function in non-diabetics may be operative in the diabetic population under study such as the presence of vascular disease ingestion of aspirin-like substances exercise smoking and the use of the contraceptive pill  For these reasons studies detailing the effects of diabetic control on platelet function must be interpreted with caution 
More work is needed in this area along with more reliable reproducible and physiological assessments of platelet activity  In addition it is important to know which of the altered plasma factors in the diabetic state are responsible for enhanced platelet function 
If tight diabetic control leads to restoration of platelet function to normal is this a reflection of the fall in blood glucose alteration in plasma lipids and fatty acids restoration of normal endothelial cell integrity or other mechanisms  However bearing in mind these constraints what is the current evidence linking diabetic control and platelet function 
Associations between glycaemic control and parameters of platelet function have been sought both in cross-sectional studies and prospective studies and conflicting findings have been reported  In an early study of Î²-thromboglobulin in a mixed group of 72 diabetic subjects no correlation was found with simultaneous measurements of plasma glucose concentration Burrows et al 1978 
Platelet factor 4 showed a significant positive correlation with plasma glucose concentration in a small group of insulin-dependent diabetics but no correlation was seen for Î²-thromboglobulin and no relationship was found for either of the platelet-specific proteins in a larger group of non-insulin-dependent diabetics Davi et al 1982  Several studies have sought relationships between glycosylated haemoglobin as a measure of overall glycaemic control and platelet-specific protein levels but no correlations were found Mathews et al 1979 Betteridge et al 1981 Davi et al 1982 
Equally conflicting results with regard to glycaemic control and platelet-specific protein levels have been reported in longitudinal studies  In nine newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetics mean Î²-thromboglobulin levels fell from 74 ng/ml range 24â€“177 ng/ml to 39 ng/ ml as treatment with diet and hypoglycaemic agents reduced mean blood glucose concentrations from 14.3 to 8.5 mmol/l 
Preston et al 1978  However in longitudinal studies of moderately well controlled insulin-dependent diabetics treated with CS11 for two weeks Delamothe & Betteridge 1985 or four to eight weeks Rosove et al 1984 which led to significant lowering of mean plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels no changes were observed in platelet factor 4 or Î²-thromboglobulin levels 
On the other hand in a short-term study using the artificial pancreas normalisation of blood glucose for 48 hours led to a significant fall in Î²-thromboglobulin levels Voisin et al 1983  As has been discussed elsewhere in this book hyperlipoproteinaemia is common in diabetes mellitus and in some studies correlations have been sought between platelet-specific protein levels and fasting total serum cholesterol triglycerides and the individual lipoproteins 
These measurements were available in 49 of the diabetic subjects studied by Betteridge et al 1981  Small but statistically significant correlations were found between B-thromboglobulin levels and total triglyceride VLDL-triglyceride LDL-cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio 
The correlations were positive apart from the correlation with HDL/total cholesterol which was negative  These findings suggest that changes seen in platelet-specific proteins in diabetes might be secondary to associated hyperlipoproteinaemia 
In addition these correlations between individual lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and platelet-specific proteins may explain the changes of platelet-specific proteins with instigation of diabetic therapy Preston et al 1978 as lipid levels would be expected to be elevated in uncontrolled diabetes and to fall with improved control Paisey et al 1978 Simpson et al 1979  This suggested association between lipid and lipoprotein levels and enhanced platelet function in diabetes is supported by many studies which have described abnormal platelet function in hyperlipidaemic non-diabetic subjects Nordoy & Rodset 1971 Carvalho et al 1974 Shattil et al 1977 Colman 1978 Joist et al 1979 Tremoli et al 1979 which have measured in vitro platelet aggregation platelet factor 4 plasma antiheparin activity and a bleeding-time test 
In addition the platelet-specific proteins Î²-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 were highly significantly elevated in a large group of hyperlipaemic subjects compared to normolipaemic controls Zahavi et al 1981  The mechanism of lipid-induced effects of platelet function has received considerable attention 
Shattil et al 1975 studied the effect of incubating normal platelets with cholesterol-rich liposomes  This led to a substantial increase in platelet cholesterol concentration the bulk of this increase being associated with the platelet membrane 
Along with these changes in cholesterol concentration the cholesterol-rich platelets showed enhanced sensitivity to adrenaline and ADP measured by aggregometry and 14 C-serotonin release  Conversely platelets incubated with cholesterol-poor liposomes showed a reduced cholesterol content and significantly reduced sensitivity to ADP 
On the basis of these findings Shattil et al 1975 postulated that cholesterol enrichment of the platelet membrane might affect the membrane fluidity and consequently the sensitivity to aggregating agonists  In support of this suggestion the same workers Shattil et al 1977 found that platelets from patients with Type 2 hyperlipoproteinaemia had a higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and other workers have found an elevated platelet-free cholesterol in patients with the same condition Miettinen 1974 
In addition Shattil and Cooper 1976 described increased platelet membrane microviscosity following incubation of platelets with cholesterol-rich liposomes and Sinha et al 1977 found an impaired response of the membrane-associated enzyme adenylate cyclase to the stimulating effect of various agents including prostaglandin E 1 as shown by a decrease in production of cyclic AMP  More recent studies have demonstrated that increases in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of platelets resulted in increased liberation of arachidonate WÃ¶rner & Patscheke 1980 
In addition Aviram and Brook 1983 have provided evidence for a direct effect on in vitro platelet function for the cholesterol-rich lipoprotein LDL and the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein VLDL  These workers incubated the purified lipoprotein for 30 minutes with gel-filtered platelets and demonstrated that VLDL and LDL increased thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and 14 C-serotonin release induced by adrenaline ADP and thrombin 
However Hassall et al 1983 who examined the relationship of in vitro aggregation to adrenaline ADP collagen and thrombin to prevailing  Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in a normal male population found little relationship between VLDL and platelet sensitivity except for a reduced adrenaline response in subjects in the lowest quintile for VLDL concentrations 
In contrast total and LDL cholesterol concentrations did appear to influence platelet sensitivity to adrenaline and to a lesser extent ADP Hassall et al 1983  Lipoproteins may indirectly affect platelet function by altering vascular endothelial cell function 
Recent experimental work has suggested that lipoproteins VLDL obtained from diabetic animals streptozotocin diabetic rats may be more toxic to cultured porcine endothelial cells than lipoproteins obtained from control animals  This effect which may be due to increased lipid peroxide levels in diabetes was reversed by insulin treatment Arbogast et al 1982 
Other studies have shown increased lipid peroxide levels in lipoproteins isolated from diabetic patients Nishigaki et al 1981 and animals Higuchi 1982  These findings suggest that lipoprotein abnormalities in the diabetic state may also indirectly affect platelet function by damaging vascular endothelium 
There is as yet no direct measure of endothelial damage in the intact animal  However some recent studies have measure plasma levels of Factor VIII-related antigen as an indirect measure of endothelial cell damage together with Î²-thromboglobulin levels 
Rak et al 1983 found that plasma levels of both proteins were elevated in diabetics including children  It is difficult to determine therefore whether endothelial damage preceded the evidence of enhanced platelet-release reaction or not 
Janka et al 1983 studied Factor VIII-related antigen and Î²-thromboglobulin levels in groups of diabetics with and without vascular disease  These authors found an increase in Factor VIII-related antigen in all groups of diabetics whereas Î²-thromboglobulin was only elevated in diabetics with retinopathy 
This study suggests that endothelial damage as assessed by Factor VIII-related antigen levels may precede evidence of in vivo platelet aggregation  Recently Winocour et al 1983 have been able to examine the time-course of alterations in platelet function and vascular endothelial cell damage as assessed by measurement of plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor and Factor VIII-related antigen in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin 
These authors found that whereas enhanced platelet function increased aggregation to ADP was detectable as early as three days following induction of diabetes elevated levels of the Factor VIII components were not seen for 14â€“28 days  Therefore these findings suggest that in this experimental model evidence of enhanced platelet function occurs before evidence of endothelial damage suggesting that the enhanced platelet aggregation is not merely secondary to endothelial cell damage 
In this study no difference was observed in the plasma cholesterol concentration between control and diabetic rats  However plasma triglycerides were elevated in the diabetic animals soon after the induction of the disease and the authors speculated that this may have contributed to the development of the platelet and vessel-wall changes 
The relationship between platelet aggregation and diabetic control is even more confounding than that for the platelet-specific proteins various studies either showing no change increased or decreased platelet aggregation in response to improved glycaemic control  Platelet aggregation in response to adrenaline showed striking changes when studied before and after stabilisation of poorly controlled diabetics Peterson et al 1977 in that the lag phase following the addition of adrenaline was prolonged from a mean of 19 to 65 seconds following stabilisation 
In addition there was a significant inverse correlation between glycosylated haemoglobin levels and the lag phase suggesting that the platelets were less sensitive to adrenaline when better glycaemic control had been achieved Peterson et al 1977  More recently platelet-aggregation responses have been studied in diabetics treated with CS11 or the artificial pancreas 
After strict metabolic control was achieved in 10 insulin-dependent diabetics for 24 hours with the aid of the artificial pancreas mean blood glucose levels falling from 13.3 mmol/l to 5.1 mmol/l a significant decrease in the aggregation response to ADP was observed Giugliano et al 1982  Along with this there was a significant reduction in circulating platelet aggregates 
No such changes were observed in a group of eight insulin-dependent diabetics whose glycaemic control was only monitored during the study period Giugliano et al 1982  Other authors found similar findings with regard to circulating platelet aggregates 
A group of 92 diabetics were divided into 39 with poor control glycosylated haemoglobin >9 per cent and 53 with good control glycosylated haemoglobin <9 per cent and the results of the platelet-aggregate ratio analysed  Diabetics with poor control had platelet-aggregate ratios significantly lower than those with good control indicating the presence of more circulating aggregates in the poorly controlled group 
In addition a significant inverse correlation between the platelet-aggregate ratio and glycosylated haemoglobin was found for the whole group Dettori et al 1983  Juhan et al 1982 also studied the effect of glycaemic normalisation by the artificial pancreas on platelet function but employed other techniques 
These authors attempted to assess platelet function in citrated whole blood by determining the platelet aggregates formed following electromagnetic agitation for 15 minutes  The aggregates formed were fixed with formol and the results expressed as the percentage of platelets aggregated compared to a reference platelet count performed before the agitation 
After 24 hours of normoglycaemia platelet aggregation returned to levels seen in non-diabetic controls Juhan et al 1982  Using CS11 to obtain improved glycaemic control for longer periods other workers have failed to demonstrate changes in platelet aggregation in vitro Rosove et al 1984 Delamothe & Betteridge 1985 
However one study has not only shown persistence of enhanced platelet reactivity in response to collagen and sodium arachidonate despite a 1 6-week period of near normal glycaemic control but also an increase in platelet reactivity to ADP Jackson et al 1984  Thromboxane production by platelets stimulated with arachidonic acid showed a significant positive correlation with the fasting plasma glucose concentration obtained at the same time in a group of 15 diabetics studied by Halushka et al 1981 b 
In addition platelet thromboxane synthesis was lower in a group of diabetics treated with CS11 for six months compared to a control group on conventional therapy McDonald et al 1982  However when normal platelets were incubated with increasing glucose concentrations in vitro thromboxane production was unaffected Best et al 1979 and the findings of Halushka et al 1981 b and McDonald et al 1982 have not been supported by a recent study of platelet thromboxane generation before and after CS11 Jackson et al 1984 
These authors measured thromboxane generation in response to arachidonic acid and collagen in a group of 11 diabetic patients with neuropathy  Before CS11 arachidonic acid-stimulated thromboxane production was enhanced in the diabetics compared to controls and this enhanced production persisted after CS11 for 16 weeks 
On the other hand collagen-stimulated thromboxane production was similar to controls before CS11 apart from at the lowest collagen concentration 0.5 Î¼g/ml when thromboxane production was in fact lower than that seen in control subjects  After CS11 this apparent subnormal thromboxane production returned to normal Jackson et al 1984 
This finding may be due to a reduced level of arachidonic acid in platelet membrane phospholipids of diabetic subjects as described by Jones et al 1983  This reduced level of arachidonic acid showed a negative correlation with glycosylated haemoglobin Jones et al 1983 
The finding therefore of an increase in collagen-stimulated thromboxane production by CS 11 could be explained by an increased availability of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids Jackson et al 1984  Information about the effect of diabetic control on prostacyclin production comes from animal studies 
Harrison et al 1980 demonstrated that the reduced prostacyclin release measured by bioassay from aorta and renal cortex of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was restored to that seen in control non-diabetic rats by chronic eight days treatment with insulin  However no effects were seen on prostacyclin production acutely after the start of insulin treatment 
It is likely that chronic insulin treatment is necessary to allow endothelial cell loss or damage to be repaired Harrison et al 1980  These findings have been extended in the streptozotocin diabetic rat by Rogers and Larkins 1981 
These authors measured the production of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F 1 Î± the stable metabolite of prostacyclin by rat aorta  They demonstrated that the reduced production of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F 1 Î± seen in chronically diabetic rats four-six weeks could be restored by a dose of insulin 8 U/kg/day that only partially corrected their plasma glucose and body weight Rogers & Larkins 1981 
The studies discussed so far have dealt with the effects of insulin deficiency in the experimental diabetic rat on prostacyclin production and the effects of insulin treatment  However the possible role of peripheral hyperinsulinaemia as a risk factor for vascular disease has been emphasised Stout 1981 and pertinent to this hypothesis are the findings of Lasche and Larson 1982 
These authors studied the effects of high insulin concentrations on prostacyclin production by rat aortic rings in vitro and demonstrated that prostacyclin production was significantly reduced in the presence of insulin at concentrations of 2500 500 and 250 Î¼U/ml Lasche & Larson 1982  Thus a possible deleterious effect of hyperinsulinaemia may be the inhibition of prostacyclin production by arterial wall 
The sensitivity of platelets from diabetic subjects to the antiaggregatory effects of prostacyclin has been examined in a cross-sectional study using the electronic whole blood platelet aggregometer Jones et al 1985  A positive correlation was found between glycosylated haemoglobin concentration and the prostacyclin concentration necessary to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 50 per cent 
This finding suggests that under situations of poor glycaemic control platelets from diabetic subjects are less sensitive to the antiaggregatory effects of prostacyclin Jones et al 1985  There are a variety of sulphonylurea agents available for the therapy of diet-failed non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects varying mainly in their half-life and mode of excretion 
In addition to their hypoglycaemic action it is probable that some or all of these compounds may have antiplatelet effects  Thus gliclazide depresses various parameters of platelet function in vitro and appears to inhibit arachidonate release from platelet phospholipids Tsuboi et al 1981 and to activate platelet adenylate cyclase leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP Lagarde et al 1975 
In addition ex vivo platelet aggregation to ADP and adrenaline was significantly reduced in diabetic subjects treated for up to a year with therapeutic doses of gliclazide Poari et al 1979  These authors considered that the antiplatelet action observed was unrelated to effects on glycaemic control as the two effects were dissociated in time Poari et al 1979 
However other workers who studied the effect of gliclazide in diabetic subjects have felt that the beneficial effects of gliclazide on platelet function were likely to be due to its hypoglycaemic action rather than to any direct effect on haemostatic function Paton et al 1982 b  Gliclazide is the sulphonylurea that has received most study in terms of possible effects on platelet function 
However other sulphonylurea preparations may also have antiplatelet effects  Thus tolbutamide in high concentrations has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and interfere with the platelet-release reaction Roth et al 1971 
In addition in a study of diet diet plus glibenclamide and diet plus gliclazide on plasma glucose and platelet function in a group of newly diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetics both glibenclamide and gliclazide reduced the increased platelet sensitivity to ADP seen in the diet period Klaff et al.  1979 
Furthermore glibenclamide therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the platelet-aggregation response to adrenaline 10 Î¼mol and collagen 750 Î¼g/ml  Obviously further work needs to be done in this area and long-term studies now in progress using antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and dipyridamole need to be evaluated for possible protective effects on the development of microvascular and macrovascular disease in diabetic subjects 
In addition the newer agents such as prostacyclin and its stable analogues and thromboxane synthetase inhibitors need to be similarly evaluated  Certainly a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor has been shown to reduce urinary albumin excretion in insulin-dependent diabetics Barnett et al 1984 
A further potentially exciting area yet to be explored in the diabetic population is the dietary substitution of the Ï‰-3 series of fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic and decosahexaenoic acids which has been shown to favourably affect platelet function in non-diabetic subjects Siess et al 1980 Thorngren & Gustafson 1981 Lorenz et al 1983  In this chapter I have described some aspects of platelet physiology and biochemistry and the possible role of this interesting cell in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thrombosis 
A tentative conclusion that could be drawn from the discussion of platelet-function abnormalities in diabetics would be that the increased platelet reactivity may represent a prethrombotic state and contribute to the as-yet-unexplained increased vascular risk in these patients  However although there have been tremendous developments in this field there remain many unanswered questions 
As knowledge of basic platelet metabolism increases it will be more easy to identify platelet abnormalities and their pathogenesis in diabetes mellitus  Future developments hopefully will lead to better and more reliable tests of platelet function able to establish the prethrombotic state with more certainty 
This would enable prospective studies to be performed to determine the importance of platelet function in the development of vascular disease  In addition improved therapeutic agents with more specific and controlled effects on platelet metabolism may be developed allowing more effective intervention 
Certainly two recent preliminary reports of prospective studies of currently available antiplatelet agents and the progression of vascular disease in diabetics have been disappointing Abraira et al 1985 Kohner & Baudoin 1985  The effects of the diabetic state on the vascular endothelium and its interaction with platelets and other formed elements of blood need to be explored which will require specific measurements of in vivo endothelial cell metabolism 
In addition the role of the numerous growth factors and their control in platelets macrophages and endothelium needs to be explored in diabetes and should lead to new insights in the development of diabetic vascular complications  Dr Ken Taylor qualified and spent his early training years in London 
His MD research project at St Bartholomew 's Hospital concerned lipid metabolism in relation to diabetes  In 1978 he took up a Senior Registrar post in Diabetes at the General Hospital Birmingham and in 1981 his present post as Consultant Physician at Dudley Road Hospital Birmingham 
His special interests include factors contributing to the development of atheroma and its complications and prevention by ensuring that patients benefit fully from the practical application of current knowledge and developments  From the earlier chapters it is apparent that myocardial infarction is an all-too-frequent occurrence in diabetic patients whether they are insulin-dependent or not 
Mortality is 33â€“38 per cent as opposed to 17â€“18 per cent in the non-diabetic population Partamian et al 1965 Czyzk et al 1980 Gwilt et al 1984  Possible reasons for this 2-fold difference are as follows 
Myocardial infarction may lead to increased secretion of counter-regulatory hormones catecholamines and cortisol which antagonise the actions of insulin and cause a deterioration in the metabolic environment  Elevation of blood glucose ketone bodies and free fatty acids in particular may be deleterious to the injured area of myocardium and predispose to arrhythmias Oliver et al 1968 impaired contractility or larger infarcts Kjekshus and MjÃ¸s 1972 Liedtke et al 1978 Vik-Mo & MjÃ¸s 1981 compared to non-diabetics predisposing to cardiogenic shock or left ventricular failure 
Diabetic patients may have a damaged myocardium due to extensive atheroma and/or small-vessel cardiomyopathy before infarction Hamby et al 1974 Regan et al 1977 Factor et al 1980 which would make them more likely to develop cardiogenic shock or heart failure  A study to determine if excellent metabolic control reduced the mortality from myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes was disappointingly negative Gwilt et al 1984 but a similar study on a smaller number of patients in Scotland showed considerable benefit Clark et al 1985 indicating the need for further investigation 
Pre-existing disease of the coronary macro-circulation and perhaps microcirculation may be the most important factors affecting mortality from acute myocardial infarction in diabetic patients  Although there may not be any benefit on mortality from very good diabetic control immediately following myocardial infarction it is clearly undesirable to have uncontrolled diabetes at this time 
An interesting feature that has emerged recently is the number of patients who are newly diagnosed as diabetic at the time of their myocardial infarction Oswald et al 1984  This study suggested an overall prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes of 5.3 per cent in patients presenting with acute infarction 
It used to be thought that this was temporary diabetes resulting from the stress of infarction but present data suggest that these patients have undiagnosed diabetes before infarction Husband et al 1983 Oswald et al 1984  Clearly those looking after patients following infarction need to be aware that a significant number will be known diabetics and some will have undiagnosed diabetes and they will all tend to have a higher mortality than non-diabetics 
Myocardial infarction will tend to cause a deterioration in the diabetes  It goes without saying that testing of the urine for glucose and ketones should be mandatory for all patients admitted with infarction and this should be continually charted for those found to be diabetic 
Ketonuria is an important indicator that diabetes is inadequately controlled  While urine testing remains the single most useful screening test for diabetes and the adequacy of its management blood testing in addition provides definitive information and avoids the pitfall of a high renal threshold not uncommon in older patients or the problem of not having a urine specimen immediately available 
A reasonable course is to measure the blood glucose of all patients when they present with infarction  For known diabetics the blood glucose can be rechecked four-hourly for at least the first 48 hours 
An alternative to blood testing by the laboratory is the use of a test strip in conjunction with a reflectance meter  This is standard now in many coronary care units and is reliable provided staff are competent with the technique 
If the blood glucose is above 20 mmol/l a sample should be sent to the laboratory for a definitive result  Although infarction can be expected to disturb diabetes it does not invariably do so 
For some patients observation with little change in regime may be all that is necessary  The diet following infarction will obviously be quite light 
Non-insulin-dependent patients may be receiving diet alone or diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents  Undoubtedly metformin therapy should be discontinued as this drug can predispose to lactic acidosis if tissue hypoxia occurs Bergman et al 1978 Luft et al 1978 Nattrass & Alberti 1978 
This is more likely following infarction when cardiac output may be reduced and therefore tissue perfusion impaired  If patients are receiving sulphonylureas at the time of admission there is no contraindication to their continuation although one should be wary of the very long-acting chlorpropamide as hypoglycaemia is more likely 
Although patients with infarction may vomit at presentation or secondary to opiate administration this usually settles with antiemetics and may not interfere with oral therapy  A recent study did not identify a blood glucose level above which complications developed in the diabetic patient with infarction Gwilt et al 1984 and one has to rely on clinical judgement of what is reasonable 
Probably a blood glucose of 12 mmol/l or above on more than one occasion should indicate oral therapy for the patient on diet alone or insulin for the patient on maximal oral therapy  Clearly a short-acting sulphonylurea such as tolbutamide or a medium-acting one such as glibenclamide is particularly useful in this situation 
If insulin is required a convenient regime is to use a highly purified porcine or human short-acting insulin subcutaneously  A single dose may be needed to reduce a markedly elevated blood glucose and then glycaemic control may be maintained with twice-daily injections 
In some cases it may be necessary to resort to three or four injections of short-acting insulin  The dietitian will need to be informed so that regular amounts of carbohydrate can be provided in a suitable form 
When the patient is over the acute episode and begins recovery the insulin requirement usually decreases  A decision can then be taken whether to revert to oral agents or continue with insulin 
If the latter course is chosen the patient can either be transferred to a once-daily insulin regime with a long-acting insulin or alternatively a twice-daily regime perhaps with a fixed combination of short- and intermediate-acting insulin  If the patient is left on insulin following discharge from hospital the question of continuing insulin therapy can be reviewed in the diabetic clinic 
Clearly it is important to review all these patients after discharge from hospital and decide their long-term management  A minority of patients will run a very stormy course after admission with myocardial infarction complicated perhaps by arrhythmias severe heart failure and reinfarction 
They will be maximally stressed and probably able to take little orally due to vomiting and/or impaired gastrointestinal absorption  Under these circumstances an intravenous infusion of insulin provides a very convenient and reliable method for managing the diabetes 
The principal limitation to intravenous therapy with insulin is the availability of skilled and diligent nursing staff to ensure that the apparatus is correctly set up the infusion rate is as instructed and the insulin is infused into the patient  However on a coronary care unit with adequate trained and qualified staff this is not usually a problem 
Highly purified porcine or human short-acting insulin is added to a small volume of normal saline and infused using a pump set at a rate dependent on blood glucose monitoring  The blood glucose should be monitored hourly after commencing an intravenous insulin infusion to ensure that the patient is not becoming hypoglycaemic 
This may not be obvious clinically in a sedated poorly perfused patient with a complicated infarction  Once a satisfactory level is achieved then blood glucose monitoring can be extended initially to two-hourly 
At least one major centre is using a continuous intravenous insulin infusion for all diabetics with infarcts Lamb 1984  For patients with complicated infarctions requiring intensive insulin therapy the recovery phase will be heralded by a diminishing insulin requirement 
At this stage it is convenient to change to an insulin regimen intermediate between the intravenous infusion and the relaxed regimen of one or two injections per day in the well patient  Six-hourly subcutaneous injections of highly purified short-acting insulin usually meet the requirements and are continued for one or two days before the final transition is made to the patient 's customary insulin regimen 
Sliding scales should be mentioned at this point  They tend to be frowned upon by those caring for diabetic patients 
They are frequently written in a way that omits insulin when the blood glucose is within the normal range and they usually fail to take account of the insulin resistance induced by increased ketone body production  Occasionally diabetic patients can become severely ketotic without being very hyperglycaemic 
The most important principle of insulin therapy in the insulin-dependent patient is that insulin must be given regularly to inhibit lipolysis and prevent ketosis  The foregoing is summarised in Figure 6.1 
Who should look after the diabetic patients on the coronary care unit or the intensive therapy unit  I believe all doctors and nurses using these units are more than capable of managing most of the diabetic problems 
The role of the physician with an interest in diabetes is to ensure that they have the necessary treatment policies and training and that he is readily available for advice on the more difficult cases  One of the most important aims of modern diabetic care must be to delay the onset of chronic complications by optimal management 
Let us consider why careful management may be beneficial  We have evidence from studies on non-diabetics that treating hypertension reduces the incidence of stroke congestive cardiac failure and possibly myocardial infarction Veterans Administration Co-operative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents 1967,1970 Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program 1979 
Studies on serum cholesterol levels in non-diabetics have shown that a degree of primary prevention of coronary artery disease is achieved by lowering serum cholesterol levels in high-risk populations of males with significant hypercholesterolaemia using diet and drug treatment The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial 1984 or diet alone Hjermann et al 1981  Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are common accompaniments of diabetes and it is not illogical to anticipate similar benefits if these atherogenic factors are dealt with effectively in the diabetic patient 
Figure 6.1 The management of the blood glucose during myocardial infraction  Hyperglycaemia per se is an important factor predisposing to atheroma possibly via an effect on platelet aggregation or on structural proteins comprising the tissues of the arterial wall or by mechanisms unknown 
There have been no studies yet in diabetics showing that a group with really good glycaemic control has a lower incidence of coronary artery disease than a well-matched control group  Such studies will be difficult to mount because they will need large numbers of patients followed over many years to demonstrate any benefit 
It is surely unjustifiable not to provide optimal control of blood glucose in the rest of the diabetic population while the results of these studies are awaited provided that the means of achieving optimal glycaemic control are acceptable to patients free from undesirable effects and not unduly expensive  Three major steps forward in diabetic care in this century have been the discovery of insulin the development of treatment programmes for diabetic ketoacidosis and the management of pregnancy in the diabetic patient 
This latter breakthrough brought together diabetologist and obstetrician to produce comprehensive care with improved glycaemic control contributing to dramatic decreases in perinatal mortality and morbidity Karlsson & Kjellmer 1972  I suspect that we are about to witness a similar phenomenon with regard to the chronic complications of diabetes including coronary artery disease due to comprehensive patient care with special emphasis on control of blood glucose blood pressure lipids and a decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking 
This type of diabetes is diagnosed usually in the first half of life exposing those affected to abnormal levels of blood glucose and other metabolites for decades  Many of these individuals will lose their remaining endogenous insulin secretion as Î²-cell destruction progresses becoming wholly dependent on exogenous insulin with the associated problems of more difficult glycaemic control 
A prime requirement for the prevention of chronic complications such as coronary heart disease appears to be good glycaemic control because many associated abnormalities such as hyperlipidaemia Sosenko et al 1980 and perhaps increased platelet aggregation Petersen et al 1977 may be improved as the blood glucose level is normalised  Undoubtedly the ideal solutions would be I preservation of significant Î²-cell function by selectively suppressing immunological destruction permitting at least some degree of physiological glucose homeostasis or 2 a miniature insulin pump that would infuse insulin subcutaneously regulated by a sensor indicating the tissue fluid glucose level together with a suitably programmed microprocessor system 
Both these approaches are being actively investigated and one day we may see a revolution in management of Type I diabetes  For the moment we have to rely on intermittent subcutaneous injections which impose quite definite restrictions 
If the same dose and type of insulin are given at the same time each day and either the food intake or the amount of physical activity fluctuates to a significant degree the consequences are going to be unacceptable hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia  In the not-too-distant past the attitude of physicians was very much to avoid even the suggestion of hypoglycaemic reactions at any time and always to keep a little glucose in the urine especially at bedtime 
The diabetic clinic of those days did not even have blood glucose results available when patients were seen now most clinics enjoy this advance  Two more recent developments have been home blood glucose monitoring and the glycosylated haemoglobin HbA 1 or fructosamine indicators of the integrated blood glucose level over the preceding few weeks 
Home monitoring is now possible using test strips either in conjunction with a meter or simply using visual assessment  The real advantage with this development is that the patient can now start to appreciate how the blood glucose varies with diet exercise and illness 
Measuring the blood glucose at home will not in itself result in improved glycaemic control  The patient must understand the achievable range of blood glucose and have the knowledge and confidence to attain that range consistently by balancing the dose of insulin with diet exercise and inter-current illness 
We are expecting much more of patients than in the past  Undoubtedly some will be unable to cope with this emphasis on self-management because they lack either the intelligence or perhaps more importantly the motivation to do so 
For those who are capable of learning how to modify diet and insulin dose to suit prevailing circumstances and want to do so the ability to determine their own blood glucose has been a major step forward permitting more satisfactory glycaemic control and a more adventurous approach to many activities Skyler et al 1978 Sonksen et al 1978 Walford et al 1978  The other important development has been the glycosylated haemoglobin level 
This gives an indication of the ambient blood glucose level over the previous two or three months and is the best single indicator we have at present of glycaemic control  We can now classify patients as having good or bad glycaemic control 
More importantly we can supply patients with their results so that they can see how effective their personal management has been  If the result is unsatisfactory it can be used as a motivating factor to persuade them to try and make an improvement 
Serum fructosamine concentration looks a possible alternative to HbA 1 Baker et al 1985 it is reliable and reflects the integrated blood glucose level over three to six weeks versus eight to 12  Advantages of fructosamine are that it does not depend on the haemoglobin level and it will probably be considerably cheaper 
The principal aim of the modern diabetic clinic must be to prevent complications and therefore it needs to be organised so that Type 1 patients can be motivated and educated successfully to manage their diabetes  A programme of teaching is required taking place outside the diabetic clinic at times convenient to the patients avoiding loss of time from school and work 
The programme needs to be practical so that patients can apply what they have learned to their own situations  It needs to cover the essentials of self-management diet insulin type and duration of action injection timing and technique measuring blood glucose and the normal range hypoglycaemia exercise and illness 
It should include assessment and provide feedback on progress with glycosylated haemoglobin levels  It was in the late 1970s that the potential hazards of traditional carbohydrate restriction were fully realised 
Carbohydrate restriction had been used in the preinsulin era to try to control hyperglycaemia  When insulin was introduced its use in less severe form was continued with the intention of keeping the dose of insulin down and controlling the blood glucose 
The hazard of this diet was that patients had to have an alternative source of energy so they turned to fat  Foods such as fatty meats cheese cream and butter were often eaten in liberal amounts 
These foods contain saturated fat and cholesterol and their effect is to tend to increase the serum cholesterol McGill et al 1968 Keys 1970  Diabetics tend to have higher serum cholesterol levels than non-diabetes Santen et al 1972 and the old diabetic diet only recently abandoned may have been a contributing factor 
Enthusiasm for a change in dietary recommendations for diabetic patients was fuelled by growing awareness of links between the serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease and dietary fat intake and serum cholesterol in the non-diabetic population  Suddenly the inadvisability of having an atheroma-prone group on a high-fat diet was fully recognised 
The diet currently recommended for diabetics in the UK is relatively low in fat and high in unrefined carbohydrate and fibre British Diabetic Association 1982  The diet should have a beneficial effect on blood lipids without contributing to hyperglycaemia 
If attitudes to the content of the diabetic diet have changed radically the importance of the regularity of meals and snacks is as important as ever for the patient on intermittent injections of insulin  Now that the aim is to keep the young diabetic 's blood glucose in single figures as much as possible the risk of hypoglycaemia is increased and there is much less latitude for missing breakfast after a late night or delaying a meal 
This is probably one of the most difficult factors for the young diabetic to accept and undoubtedly a great advantage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is that it permits the patient greater flexibility in relation to the timing of meals with manual boluses of insulin 30 minutes beforehand  Perhaps the greatest single problem with diet as an instrument of therapy is persuading patients to comply with it 
There are three ingredients required for successful compliance first the patient must be motivated to comply second he must be informed about diet in a way that is individually appropriate thirdly realistic and attainable objectives must be set  The patient is then rewarded by achieving these objectives and motivation is enhanced 
The motivational ingredient is the most difficult  Successful motivation depends on emphasising positive tangible benefits 
Promises such as you will avoid complications or live longer may be grasped with enthusiasm by the over-forties but are unlikely to appeal to youngsters  Informing appropriately has been neglected in the past 
Diet used to be taught by personal interview and printed diet sheet  It is odd that doctors accepted this approach because as medical students we were never taught in this way rather by demonstration and participation 
To make matters worse many dietary instructional leaflets required a reading age not attained by the target population  The old way to teach about an aspect of diet say party-eating at Christmas would be to discuss it and hand out a leaflet 
The modern way is to meet a group of patients over a party-type meal and discuss how to cope with the problems that may arise  Experienced diabetic patients make good practical teachers 
Hopefully this approach may avoid the extremes of complete abandonment of dietary principles on the one hand and obsessional self-denial on the other  A very important advance has been highly purified insulin and more recently we have had human insulin from recombinant DNA which will probably become the major source of the world 's insulin in the future 
We have insulins which cover a wide range of duration of action but we still have injections which must be the least palatable aspect of life for the patient requiring insulin  A patient commencing insulin needs to be taught and to learn about the equipment its care and storage drawing up insulin injection technique sites to use and timing of injections 
This is the easy part proving difficult only for those with unsteady hands poor vision or failure to comprehend  More difficult is conveying that injections must be self-administered and must not be missed 
Self-administration is important because it implies the acceptance by the patient that he has diabetes and realises the importance of self-reliance  Most people caring for diabetic patients realise the importance of the patient actively participating in the very first injection of insulin 
It is symbolic of the attitude that injecting insulin need not be frightening or difficult and can be coped with by the patient from the very beginning with just a little guidance  Failure to achieve this goal at the outset may result in a patient who depends on others for insulin injections misses injections or does them with a very poor technique 
The result is an unhappy patient and poor glycaemic control  The answer to the question which insulin regime must be the one which produces the most satisfactory glycaemic control over 24 hours ' 
There is no virtue in several injections of insulin if the patient is well controlled on a single injection each day but this state of affairs is unlikely to be the case in a patient who has had diabetes for a number of years and has little residual Î²-cell function  It is probably better psychological strategy to start the newly insulin-requiring patient on two injections of insulin per day so that there is early acceptance of this regimen 
Bringing a group of patients together is a useful way of getting patients currently content with one injection a day to enquire why they are not having two injections a day as are the other patients they have met  We are spoilt for choice with insulins 
There are highly purified porcine and bovine varieties human insulin synthesised from porcine insulin semi-synthetic and human insulin from recombinant DNA biosynthetic  The one subject on which there seems to be unanimity is that purity of insulin has been an important advance Andreani et al 1977 
Species of insulin is less important although there may be advantages in using porcine rather than bovine insulin Clark et al 1982  Interestingly there is no convincing evidence that human insulin is preferable to porcine Home & Alberti 1982 
This explains the reluctance of many clinicians in the UK to change patients from porcine to semi-synthetic or biosynthetic human insulin  Any trend towards human insulin might increase if the price were to decrease below that of porcine insulin 
There is considerable individual variation with regard to insulin requirement  Most will need two injections of intermediate-acting insulin a day with some short-acting to cover breakfast a mid-morning snack and lunch 
Theoretically short-acting insulin in the evening would cover the evening meal and bedtime snack but some patients readily become hypoglycaemic with short-acting insulin at this time  The dawn phenomenon rising blood glucose due to an increased insulin requirement in the early morning is seen in most diabetics and presents practical problems in a few Bolli & Gerich 1984 Editorial 1984 
This may be the cause of marked prebreakfast hyperglycaemia sometimes with ketonuria  A stratagem that may solve this problem is to give short-acting insulin alone before the evening meal and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime Tattersall & Gale 1981 Francis et al 1983 
The dawn phenomenon may also be successfully controlled in patients receiving infusions of insulin although the nocturnal infusion rate may need modification Geffner et al 1983 Levy-Marchal et al 1983 Bending et al 1984  Another method of producing 24-hour glycaemic control is to use a very long-acting insulin 36 hours injected before breakfast to provide the baseline insulin and supplement it with injections of short-acting insulin before breakfast and the evening meal Phillips et al 1979 
It may have a wider application with the advent of pen syringes now available utilising cartridges for short-acting insulin  Depression of the plunger delivers two units of insulin obviating the need for drawing up and simplifying the procedure for when patients are out and about 
A third injection of short-acting insulin can be added at midday if required  Suggestions that this can lead to relaxation of the guiding principles of regular rations and insulin are disquieting 
A very useful development in insulin therapy in recent years has been the fixed-dose mixture of insulin either 30 per cent short-acting and 70 per cent intermediate-acting Mixtard or equal parts of the two insulins Initard  Another insulin manufacturer has now produced a fixed mixture of insulins very similar to Mixtard called Actraphane 
It is only available as a semisynthetic human insulin whereas at present there are porcine and semisynthetic preparations of Mixtard  Evidence is accumulating that probably less benefit is achieved by juggling with proportions of short- and intermediate-acting insulin than was previously thought Roland 1984 
The fixed dose mixtures are certainly useful for patients who are unable or unwilling to draw up two different insulins  Only recently has the importance of the timing of insulin injections in relation to meals become fully realised 
This applies to patients taking short-acting insulin to cover meals and snacks  The best results are obtained if insulin is administered at least 30 minutes before the meal Lean et al 1985 
This leads to lower postprandial glucose levels and less frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia  A most useful exercise in the diabetic clinic is inspection of injection sites 
Many patients habitually use one or two sites and develop hard subcutaneous plaques or disfiguring insulin hypertrophy  It is fruitless asking patients if their injection sites are satisfactory as they invariably say that they are they come to regard the abnormal as normal 
Absorption from such sites is very likely to be erratic leading to poorly controlled diabetes and possibly unexplained hypoglycaemia  How much insulin does a patient need 
Enough to keep him ketone-free with single-figure blood glucose levels most of the time at as near ideal body weight as possible and avoiding hypoglycaemia  The most common pitfall in managing insulin-requiring diabetes is to respond to elevated blood glucose levels by increasing the dose of insulin 
Certain key aspects need to be reviewed before increasing the dose of insulin including diet injection technique and condition of injection sites  A most undesirable feature is the production of an obese diabetic by inappropriately increasing the insulin dose and failing to detect latent hypoglycaemia 
Insulin dose needs to be titrated against the results of home monitoring of blood glucose levels a careful search for evidence of hypoglycaemia and a continuous record of bodyweight  This can be a very effective method of achieving good glycaemic control for diabetic patients requiring insulin Mecklenburg et al 1982 1985 
Patients need to be carefully selected so that they are sensible and responsible  It is particularly appropriate for young patients with diabetes of only a few years ' duration and without complications 
Significant retinopathy is a contraindication as it may deteriorate with greatly improved glycaemic control Lauritzen et al 1983  Patients with brittle diabetes or recurrent staphylococcal infections are also unsuitable for infusion pumps 
Patients need intensive education in the use of the pump and changing the needle and infusion set  The pump delivers a continuous but adjustable basal rate and boluses can be given before meals 
It is essential that patients ensure there are no leaks of insulin where the infusion set is connected to the syringe  They need to be able to measure accurately their blood glucose and test the urine for ketones when unwell 
It is a wise precaution for them to carry conventional insulins and have a regimen organised should they be troubled by pump failure  It is also essential that they have a telephone number where diabetic expertise is continuously available 
It is not advisable to let patients travel outside the country with a pump  How long should a patient use a pump 
This is not an easy question to answer  A very useful role for the pump is to determine more accurately the patient 's insulin requirement and improve the patient 's understanding of the effect of diet insulin exercise and minor illness on the blood glucose 
A useful scheme is to try the patient on a conventional insulin regime after three to six months on a pump  The time-honoured method has been by urine testing but with the renal threshold in the not so elderly being of the order of 10 mmol/1 glycosuria is only going to occur when the blood glucose is in double figures 
This method is perhaps more acceptable for those who can not or will not cope with blood testing or who have very stable diabetes because of some residual Î²-cell function  Blood testing enables patients to see how their diet exercise illnesses and insulin affect the blood glucose 
They can confirm or refute the idea that they may be hypoglycaemic  Initially a meter was thought to be desirable for accurate monitoring but now there are available test strips which do not require a meter and are sufficiently accurate for the purpose if correctly used Ferguson & Prosser 1980 
Patients do not need to home monitor every day when their diabetes is stable but rather two or three days a week testing three or four times during the day  If it is to be of maximum benefit they must be able to perform monitoring correctly interpret the results and use the information to modify diet or insulin dose as appropriate 
Not all patients on insulin will benefit from regular home monitoring  Particularly suitable candidates are those with unstable diabetes and evidence of poor control with elevated glycosylated haemoglobin levels 
This is more prevalent than Type I and usually presents in the over-forties  It is often associated with obesity and may be latent for some years before diagnosis 
Patients often have concomitant hypertension and at the time of diagnosis may already have angina and claudication  There is a strong familial component to this type of diabetes and perhaps ideally the primary medical care service should provide an annual postprandial blood glucose test for those over 40 years with a first-degree relative who has developed diabetes before the age of 65 years 
This might reduce the length of exposure to the atherogenic factors of hyperglycaemia and disordered lipid metabolism  The single most useful measure for preventing Type 2 diabetes in the industrialised nations would be a reduction in energy intake with a consequent reduction in the prevalence of obesity hyperlipidaemia glucose intolerance and possibly hypertension 
The importance of diet in this group of patients is that for some diet alone will suffice while for the rest there must be a good dietary compliance if control is to be optimal at a steady weight whether using oral agents or insulin  Regularity of meals remains important especially for the obese 
Many of these patients claim that they can not be fat because they eat only one meal a day  This meal may of course be of gargantuan proportions and much snacking of high-energy foods may precede its consumption 
Three regular meals a day avoiding snacks often leads to weight reduction  The content of the diet for Type 2 patients need not be different to those with Type 1 
It is helpful to classify patients with Type 2 diabetes into obese and non-obese  A useful concept is that of ideal bodyweight derived from the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables 
The data are based on a different population than is seen in British clinics but it provides quantitation of the degree of obesity in practice  In our clinic we have constructed a centile graph for percentage ideal or desirable bodyweight based on medium frame size so that knowing actual weight and height we can derive the percentage ideal bodyweight at a glance without calculation Figure 6.2 
We are generous and define obesity as being more than 120 per cent ideal body weight  Selecting a target weight for the obese is important and it is essential that this is realistic 
It is counter-productive to expect a 50-year-old patient who is 160 per cent ideal bodyweight to join the ranks of the non-obese even if heroic efforts achieve this miraculous transformation it is very unlikely it could be sustained for 20 years  It is once again a matter of setting the patient an achievable and sustainable objective 
In this case if our 50-year-old reduced his weight by a stone or so and maintained it indefinitely it may well be enough to control the diabetes  For the non-obese patients simply reducing the intake of refined carbohydrate may control the diabetes for a time at least 
These patients may be at or below their ideal bodyweight so it is important they do not lose more weight  Some patients may try to starve themselves in order to avoid oral agents or insulin and this needs to be identified immediately 
Some physicians devalue dietary therapy for Type 2 diabetes by either commencing oral therapy concomitantly with diet or by giving diet alone no more than a month 's trial  The patient quickly concludes that tablets are the real treatment and the diet of secondary importance 
Not surprisingly they may consequently pay it little attention and even discard it altogether  The results of this approach are that some individuals may be committed to lifelong drug therapy which they do not need 
Others may subsequently develop poor control on tablets because of their dietary indiscretions  Some patients may need drug therapy at diagnosis if they are thin and have lost much weight with severe hyperglycaemia are very symptomatic or perhaps with evidence of infection 
However many Type 2 patients can be commenced on diet alone and reviewed in a month  A considerable proportion will be greatly improved and it is worth waiting another couple of months to see further improvement before commencing drug therapy 
If this approach is effective the patients have the reward of feeling better for their efforts and see the relationship between diet and diabetes  This provides valuable motivation to continued effort 
A point worth making here is that patients need to understand from an early stage the meaning of diabetes that they have diabetes now and that they will always have it  The following is not unusual 
A new patient attends the diabetic clinic and is informed that he has diabetes  He sees the dietitian is put on a diet and is instructed in urine testing 
His urine tests show glycosuria which over the months abates  He feels that he is cured now and stops testing 
He gradually forgets about the diet  This pitfall can be avoided by ensuring that the subject is covered in an educational programme and by providing long-term follow-up with a system that seeks out those who do not attend the clinic 
There is still considerable debate about the role of tablets in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes  When they were introduced they offered an alternative to insulin for the patient not responding to diet alone 
A study was later published which seemed to indicate that patients on tablets had a higher mortality from coronary heart disease than other groups not receiving oral therapy University Group Diabetes Program 1970  A criticism of these data was that the groups were not comparable and that this difference could have accounted for the results rather than the effects of therapy 
Later work from a retrospective study suggested that sulphonylurea therapy may reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol Kennedy et al 1978  A subsequent prospective study demonstrated that neither metformin nor glibenclamide had an adverse effect on serum total cholesterol triglyceride HDL-cholesterol or the apoproteins A-I and B Taylor et al 1982 
The introduction of biguanides was met with some scepticism of their efficacy and fears about the possibility of precipitating lactic acidosis  Later it was realised that this problem was particularly associated with phenformin and provided metformin is avoided in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment tissue hypoxia or significant ketone body production it is safe Bergman et al 1978 Luft et al 1978 Nattrass & Alberti 1978 
Phenformin has subsequently been withdrawn from the register of prescribable drugs in the UK  More has been learned about the mechanisms of action of the two oral hypoglycaemic families of drugs the sulphonylureas and the biguanides 
The sulphonylureas increase plasma insulin levels in patients in whom they are effective and they may also enhance tissue sensitivity to insulin via a postreceptor effect Lockwood et al 1984  Metformin lowers blood glucose not by an effect on insulin secretion but by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis possibly increasing peripheral low-affinity insulin receptors and it may exert a postreceptor effect Lord et al 1983 Lockwood et al 1984 
One distinct advantage of metformin over the sulphonylureas in obese Type 2 patients is that it does tend to suppress appetite and certainly therapy is usually associated with weight loss Taylor et al 1982  Disadvantages with metformin are that a minority of patients may develop a metallic taste in the mouth indigestion or loose bowel actions 
These side-effects may be avoided by using only 500-mg tablets with a maximum of three per day taken after meals  Some patients do not complain of the side-effects or relate them to therapy so it is worth questioning patients carefully to see that all is well 
Successful therapy is measured by a loss of glycosuria blood glucose levels less than 10.0 mmol/l postprandially and a glycosylated haemoglobin of 10.0 per cent or less  If this is not achieved with diet and metformin then the alternatives are adding in a guar gum preparation or a sulphonylurea 
Guar gum is a complex polysaccharide which can not be digested or absorbed and it appears to have two effects  First it takes up water and swells after ingestion so taken before meals it exerts a satiating effect and may decrease energy intake 
Secondly it seems to reduce glucose absorption in the small intestine Blackburn et al 1984  There are a number of reasonably palatable preparations of guar now available 
If guar gum proves ineffective or unpalatable then a sulphonylurea can be added preferably avoiding the excessively long-acting chloropropamide  If an obese diabetic patient has poor glycaemic control with steady or increasing bodyweight the explanation is one of noncompliance with diet 
This situation is very difficult to handle and it is worth trying to avoid early escalation of treatment with sulphonylureas and then progressing to insulin  It is important to ascertain why dietary compliance is poor 
It may be lack of understanding of the appropriate diet or an inability to put it into practice  One can try very hard on an outpatient basis to inform the patient and other members of the family particularly the spouse 
We often admit patients with this problem to the diabetic unit for a few days to demonstrate how effective the right diet can be  This also gives a good opportunity to educate about diet and test that knowledge in practical terms as well as enhancing motivation to comply 
If obese Type 2 patients who are not complying with diet are given sulphonylureas which stimulate insulin secretion or insulin itself the consequences are all too frequently an even more obese patient with glycaemic control still very poor a very undesirable situation  It is essential that this group of patients grasp the essential dietary principles at the outset 
For the non-obese Type 2 patient reducing the intake of refined carbohydrate may be effective but many may need to progress to a sulphonylurea with intermediate duration of action such as glibenclamide  Frequently patients respond to a small dose and indeed some patients may be very sensitive to this drug and care needs to be taken that hypoglycaemia does not occur 
For this reason it is prudent to commence with the smallest dose of glibenclamide namely 2.5 mg  Patients need to be cautioned about not missing meals and using alcohol with discretion when receiving sulphonylureas because of the risk of precipitating hypoglycaemia 
If a patient has lost much weight and particularly if underweight then a good case can be made for commencing insulin  The other indication for insulin is of course when glycaemic control is poor on a maximal dose of a sulphonylurea 
Sometimes metformin is added to sulphonylurea therapy usually because the patient is having difficulty coming to terms with the prospect of insulin  It is very easy for the physician to fail to appreciate how poorly controlled some Type 2 patients really are 
Patients may only record negative urine testing results in the preprandial state and starve themselves before the diabetic clinic  This is an area which has been generally illuminated by the glycosylated haemoglobin level which gives a much surer guide of the true state of glycaemic control 
For the non-obese patient over 65 years who needs a sulphonylurea a short-acting drug like tolbutamide has much to commend it as the elderly are more prone to hypoglycaemia  If this drug fails to control the diabetes than a more potent preparation such as glibenclamide may be required 
A case can be made for giving tolbutamide to those 65 years and over who are obese Type 2 patients and need an oral agent  The reasoning here is that renal function tends to decline with age and renal elimination is important in preventing accumulation of metformin at least theoretically increasing the risk of lactic acidosis Luft et al 1978 
When a Type 2 patient requires insulin perhaps the first question to ask is One or two injections a day  The answer depends partly on the age of the patient 
It is always difficult to choose an arbitrary age but perhaps under 60 years two injections and over 60 one injection  The implication is that two injections are better than one which is not always true and that less strict glycaemic control is acceptable with a shorter expected lifespan which seems reasonable 
Although two injections a day may be desirable the next question is whether it is possible  This depends on the patient 's eyesight manual dexterity and willingness 
For those commencing two daily injections the fixed insulin combinations can be very useful as older patients often find mixing insulins a difficult exercise  However for patients in their forties it is usually a simple matter to establish them on similar insulin regimens to the Type I patients 
For the over sixties a once-daily insulin will often produce satisfactory control  However if control is very poor in spite of a satisfactory diet with a single daily dose of c.50 units of insulin it is better to consider two injections rather than increasing the dose 
Before resorting to this it is worth ensuring that the injection technique is satisfactory and the injection sites are healthy  It is too easy to assume that older patients can not inject their own insulin and thus need to involve relatives or the district nurse 
The best approach is for the patient to be totally independent if at all possible  The second best is under the watchful eye or with the help of a relative 
Using a person outside the family circle such as the district nurse is positively the last resort  It is undesirable because the patient is totally dependent on someone coming into the home from outside and of course it is extremely expensive in terms of nursing time 
The following questions need answering when deciding if the patient can become independent with their injections  I Is the eyesight adequate to see the marks on the syringe 
Sometimes this can be helped by a magnifier fitted to the syringe or a separate magnifying glass  2 Can the patient remember to have the injection and the correct dose 
Someone living with the patient may be able to remind them of these points  3 Does the patient have the manual dexterity to draw up the insulin and inject it 
Keeping the regimen simple is important so that mixing of insulin is not required  If two injections are required attempting to use the same dose morning and evening may be helpful 
Fixed-dose syringes can be very useful and perhaps a relative can draw up the insulin and the patient administer it  Many patients with Type 2 diabetes retain some degree of endogenous insulin production and this may explain their tendency to have more stable blood glucose levels in contrast to patients with Type I diabetes 
Consequently Type 2 patients do not need to assess control quite as frequently as the Type I patients once good glycaemic control has been achieved  For patients on diet alone a check on the blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin by the general practitioner or diabetic clinic will suffice with the patient testing the urine for glucose twice weekly avoiding using early-morning specimens 
This needs emphasising to patients as some on diet alone quickly learn that they have glycosuria after meals so solve the problem by testing the urine after the overnight fast or before meals  This is an interesting example of the patient learning what is expected no glycosuria but adopting the wrong solution 
The correct approach is dietary modification or if that is satisfactory oral agents so that there is no postprandial glycosuria  Indications for home monitoring of blood glucose in these patients are a raised glycosylated haemoglobin or a low renal threshold 
The glycosylated haemoglobin has been a very useful advance for the Type 2 patients with latently poor control  These patients may be on diet alone or diet and oral agents with records of urine results which they have continually mislaid 
The blood glucose level checked by the practice nurse or diabetic clinic is perhaps just in single figures but with close questioning the patient has had very little to eat for several hours  The glycosylated haemoglobin result is markedly elevated revealing the extent of poor control 
Useful clinical pointers are the unavailability for various reasons of the patient 's urine tests lost book came out in a hurry left it on the bus occurring with each clinic visit and an enquiry as to when the patient last had something to eat  Some patients regard diabetic clinic days as holy days and fast for them 
This is more common in diabetic patients and is an important causative factor of coronary artery disease in its own right  It is stating the obvious but regular measurement of blood pressure using the correct technique is an essential feature of good diabetic care 
Regularly means annually for normotensive patients and more frequently for the known hypertensives  If blood pressure is elevated the first question must be Am I using the correct size cuff 
If the circumference of the upper arm is 33 cm or more a large cuff should be used Maxwell et al 1982  The diagnosis of hypertension requires more than one reading 
Additional reasons for checking the blood pressure are marked retinopathy or any evidence of proteinuria  Having measured the blood pressure it is essential to record it prominently and if hypertension is diagnosed to ensure it is adequately treated 
It is extremely worrying that in non-diabetics half the cases of hypertension are undiagnosed half those diagnosed are untreated and of the half that are treated half are inadequately controlled WHO Expert Committee on Hypertension 1978  There is no reason to believe that diabetic patients fare better and they may do less well 
With regard to treatment this subject has already been covered in some detail  An important principle of treatment is that it should control the hypertension to an acceptable degree be free from side-effects and not cause either an unacceptable deterioration of glycaemic control or have an adverse effect on blood lipids 
An unacceptable deterioration of glycaemic control occurs when control can not readily be restored by a minor alteration of the treatment regimen  To control blood pressure at the expense of the blood glucose level or with elevated lipid levels does not represent successful treatment 
If hypertension has been neglected in the diabetic care of the past lipids might not have existed for the attention they have received  Occasionally hyperlipidaemia may be overt with eruptive xanthomata lipaemia retinalis or lipaemic serum which blocks the autoanalyser and causes pseudohyponatraemia 
Usually it is covert and can only be diagnosed by specifically measuring blood lipids  A problem with diagnosing lipid disorders is that everyone has been obsessed with examining fasting specimens a requirement which presents two obstacles for diabetics 
Firstly it requires an extra visit to the hospital and secondly fasting is difficult for the patient on insulin  There is not a great difference between the serum cholesterol level in the fasting or in the fed state and it is certainly worth using a random cholesterol as a screening test 
If this is satisfactory then no further action is required as the fasting cholesterol will be lower than the random determination  Serum triglyceride levels are more affected by the ingestion of food but one quickly learns to gauge what amounts to satisfactory random cholesterol and triglyceride results and when a fasting specimen is required 
The right time to measure lipids for the newly diagnosed diabetic is when good control has been achieved and thereafter probably yearly up to the age of sixty  The treatment of hyperlipidaemia in the diabetic patient falls into three natural stages 1 control of the diabetes by appropriate diet and oral agents or insulin if necessary 2 reassessment of the diet if hyperlipidaemia persists 3 drug therapy only when the diabetes and the diet are right 
There are few studies on the prevalence of smoking in diabetics but one from the West of Scotland suggests there is little difference compared to their non-diabetic fellows Kesson & Slater 1979  This reflects badly on those involved with diabetic care because it suggests that not enough attention has been devoted to discouraging this atherogenic activity in an atheroma-prone group 
A major problem is that those caring for patients are only too well aware of the restrictions they are tending to impose  Patients are advised to eat regular meals avoid certain foods take tablets or inject themselves with insulin monitor their blood glucose levels to be careful with alcohol and see their doctors regularly 
Many physicians regard giving anti-smoking advice as just too much and this falls by the wayside  Although understandable this attitude can not be condoned 
Perhaps the best approach is to devise methods by which patients conclude for themselves that smoking is harmful and undesirable  Self-help groups can be very useful and ideally every physician caring for diabetics should have access to a person skilled in helping people to rid themselves of the smoking habit 
For many years there has been much debate in the UK about who should care for diabetic patients general practitioners or hospital-based doctors  This question has been answered to some extent by a recent paper which showed a significantly higher mortality and morbidity among diabetics discharged solely to primary care in the community compared to those cared for by the hospital diabetic clinic Hayes & Harries 1984 
If all diabetics were looked after solely by general practitioners undoubtedly some would be cared for by doctors without a real interest in the subject  If all diabetics were cared for solely by the hospital then diabetic clinics would be overloaded leading to difficulties maintaining standards and the expertise and interest in the community would probably decline 
Perhaps the way forward lies with a physician with an interest in diabetes based in each district general hospital providing a nucleus of expertise and sharing care with interested general practitioners  This would reduce the strain on hospital clinics stimulate interest and expertise in diabetes in the community and ensure diabetic patients had a regular review in a specialist clinic 
Perhaps general practitioners wishing to provide some diabetic care should have a period of training in the specialty and work for a period in a diabetic clinic to enhance their experience  Their practice nurses would need some specialist diabetic training and they would need a dietetic service 
The practice would need to be able to accurately check the blood glucose weigh the patient examine the eyes and record the results  A cooperation card could be used to facilitate communication between diabetic clinic and general practice 
The diabetic clinic is the focal point of diabetic care in the hospital  It needs to be organised to provide a happy relaxed but efficient environment for seeing patients 
The prime objective for a clinic is that the patient returns to be seen again and everything is secondary to that objective  Although achieving good control and all the other objectives are very important none of these is likely to be achieved if the patient persistently fails to attend 
Undoubtedly the skill of medical care in all specialties is balancing what the patient will accept with what the patient should accept  For example if the patient says I can not possibly measure my own blood glucose because I am at work all day the patient might be lost if the doctor were to insist 
However if the patient were introduced to other patients who were monitoring their own blood glucose levels  the situation might be quickly resolved 
Attendance at clinic is probably encouraged by avoiding long delays and making the visit worthwhile  The biggest problem with the diabetic clinic is that time tends to be very limited and perhaps it is best regarded as a place for assessment and the identification of problems with a little time for education 
The major part of teaching motivating and assessing what has been learned should take place outside the diabetic clinic  A solution we have adopted at my hospital has been a Diabetic Unit 
This consists essentially of a group of nurses specially trained in diabetic care and exclusively devoted to that specialty providing a seven days a week 24 hour per day service  They staff a unit which can take six inpatients and functions as a day unit 
Out-patients visit with or without an appointment and can telephone if they have problems  The Unit is educational first and foremost so that patients are admitted to the beds only if they are fully ambulant and not requiring parenteral therapy 
Those admitted to the acute wards with severely uncontrolled diabetes are transferred when they are sufficiently recovered and undergo assessment of their self-management  Patients poorly controlled in clinic are referred to the Unit as outpatients and only if this fails to resolve their problems is a short admission considered 
Inpatient status does permit more intensive teaching and assessment of where management is failing  A dietitian is responsible for the Unit and visits twice a day 
Patients can be seen at times of their choosing by nursing staff which may be early morning before school or work late evening or at weekends  If any difficulties arise for the nurses medical staff are readily available 
The Unit provides an excellent forum for training nurses and doctors about the practical problems of diabetes whether they are hospital or community based  It has the great asset of open access and staff/patient relationships are excellent 
Patients meet there and discuss mutual problems informally  It is complementary to the diabetic clinic and is quite at home dealing with children or pregnant diabetics 
Young children are not admitted to the Unit but there is close liaison with the Paediatric Department  It is a system that would lend itself to any sizeable district general hospital 
The future should see more contact between interested primary-care physicians and hospital-based diabetologists with training programmes in most districts for doctors and nurses covering all aspects of care  The newly qualified doctors of the 1980s know too little about diabetes when at least I per cent of the population suffer from this disorder with the prevalence rising 
Better organisation of care should also be associated with some time in the medical student curriculum being devoted to the practical aspects of diabetes  We look to improved insulin delivery systems perhaps suppression of the immunological insult to the islet and methods of enhancing insulin receptor activity 
Even with these advances I am sure that diabetic care will focus on helping patients to care for themselves effectively  Introduction The Animal-Watcher

AS A BOY one of my greatest pleasures was watching animals  I divided my time between my hundreds of pet animals at home and the wild animals in the Wiltshire countryside 
I spent so much time with them that I began to think like them to see the world from their point of view  I identified with them so strongly that I began to see humans who hunted animals as the enemy 
At the time this was an unfashionable attitude  Hunting-shooting-and-fishing was the norm 
In the British countryside where I wandered everyone did it  It was a way of life 
But from an early age for some reason I rebelled  I preferred foxes to foxhounds 
I found wildfowl more fascinating than wildfowlers  And I hated the anglers with their sharp hooks and their lack of understanding of what they were doing to the fish they plucked so gleefully from their wet world into our dry one 
Above all I wanted to understand the world of animals  There were so many mysteries and it was hard to know how or where to begin 
I tried to get closer to them  I discovered that sitting very still for as long as possible was the first great secret 
Most people I noticed even experienced naturalists were forever striding through the undergrowth striking out across the fields and searching searching for something new  Far better it seemed to me was the simple strategy of waiting for nature to come to you rather than going clumsily to look for it 
When Picasso was asked how he painted he replied I do not seek I find  Already in my childhood this had become my way of studying animals 
When you walk into a wood or a field you alarm everything that lives there  The moving human body is large obtrusive and highly visible 
But sit down quietly and after a while you become invisible  Nature resumes its activities the patterns of behaviour you disrupted by your arrival 
This is true whether you are in a desert or a forest or swimming on a coral reef  When I was still very young I built myself a raft from old planks and oil-drums 
I launched it on to a small lake and lying flat on its wooden platform pressed my face close to the water  The raft drifted very slowly making no disturbance and there through the mirror-smooth surface I saw a giant pike lying in wait for its prey like a lurking U-boat 
A shoal of young roach approached it unawares sensed its presence and immediately closed ranks safety in numbers before darting off  I was so close to the water that I was already beginning mentally to enter their world and to feel their dramas as my dramas 
This was all happening half a century ago before the invention of the aqualung  But I was already close enough to the aquatic world for it to become a lifelong obsession 
It did not replace my fascination for mammals birds and reptiles  It simply gave my study another dimension 
My appetite for learning about all animals simple or complex was insatiable  Inevitably I was destined to become a zoologist in later life 
The great problem I faced when I eventually obtained my degree in zoology was that to convert my childhood fascination into an adult career I would have to carry out experiments on animals  Zoology was in an intensely experimental laboratory-oriented phase and this did not appeal to me 
I was simply not prepared to treat animals in that way  In my mind I was one of them and there was no way that I was going to make a living from carrying out painful experiments on friends 
It looked very much as though I would have to find some other career  Just as I was about to give up zoology I was lucky enough to attend a lecture by the great ethologist Niko Tinbergen 
I had no idea what ethology was but I soon found out  It was the naturalistic study of animal behaviour 
Tinbergen demonstrated that it was possible simply by watching animals to make a scientific study of them  By making the watching systematic and analytical it was possible to carry out field experiments that reduced interference with the animals to a minimum 
He demonstrated that it was possible to convert amateur natural history into professional zoology by the straightforward device of quantified observation  For me this was a revelation 
It meant that by carefully counting and scoring different animal actions in given time periods I could make complicated analyses that helped to unravel the intricate behaviour patterns that existed in so many species  It meant that instead of guessing that the presence of a red spot or the flicking of a tail was acting as a threat signal or a courtship display I could set about proving it 
There was no looking back  A whole new world of animal study lay open to me and has continued to excite me ever since 
After writing about fifty scientific papers on the subject I decided to reach a wider audience and moved into television where week after week I tried to get across my fascination for the animal world  My earlier studies of fish and birds were now extended to mammals and I ended up as the curator of the largest collection of mammalian species in the world at the London Zoo 
There with a team of young research workers I was able to extend my animal behaviour studies into areas not normally available to zoologists  I could work with everything from marmosets to elephants 
I became especially interested in apes and made a long study of chimpanzees  It was at this point that I came face to face with the realisation that human beings could be studied like other animals and I went on past chimpanzees to investigate the behaviour of this strange creature that I christened The Naked Ape 
I applied the same methods here watching people rather than talking to them and I learnt many new things about the way humans interact  I published the results in a book called Manwatching and for twenty years continued my investigations into that bizarre species Homo sapiens 
Although my Manwatching study was based on my lifetime of animal-watching I had never written the book of which it was in effect the sequel  At first I was too busy writing research reports and later on I had become completely engrossed in purely human studies 
I eventually assumed that by now someone else must have written the animal version of Manwatching and recently I went to look for it  To my surprise it was not there 
There were a number of excellent textbooks on the subject but nobody had taken the trouble to present scientific animal-watching to a general audience  And that is how the present volume came to be written 
Instead of providing discussions of theories and academic abstractions I have concentrated on animal behaviour patterns that can be seen and studied by any interested person  It helps a great deal to have a large number of clear separate concepts ideas that can quickly and easily be applied to the sometimes confusing variety of animal actions we observe when we sit down to watch other species 
I have therefore made each chapter short no more than a few pages and have picked the most vivid examples in each case  The serious student of animal behaviour starts out with a basic premise namely that every spot of colour every strange posture every tiny movement that an animal makes has some special meaning 
Furthermore all these colours and actions can be understood if they are studied closely enough  Nothing an animal ever does can not be explained given sufficient patience and ingenuity on the part of the animal-watcher 
Everything has a reason every piece of behaviour functions in some way to improve the chances of survival of the animal concerned  In the end all animal mysteries can be unravelled 
To some romantics this may seem a pity  They would prefer to keep the mysteries of nature as mysterious as possible 
They feel that to explain everything will be to destroy the beauty of nature but they are wrong  To know that a particular animal dance or brightly coloured display operates as a territorial device or as a sexual arousal mechanism does not make it any less beautiful 
To understand the function of bird-song does not make it any less enchanting  The romantic refusal to analyse is based on a fallacy 
It also introduces a dangerous bias  For to the romantic the bird of paradise is much more exciting than the humble house sparrow 
Any animal species that happens to be superficially dull will be ignored perhaps even maltreated  But to the ethologist every species is fascinating the end-point of millions of years of complex evolutionary pressures 
Every species has its own intricate behaviour repertoire of survival mechanisms and even the seemingly boring species soon become exciting when one starts to probe into their particular way of life  The social behaviour of the despised house sparrow is every bit as intriguing as that of the bird of paradise to the serious animal-watcher 
A final comment on my use of the word animal  Many people confuse the terms â€“animal and mammal 
They speak of fish and insects for example as though they are not animals  What they mean of course is that they are not mammals 
All living things are either plants or animals  The amoeba is just as much an animal as the elephant 
So animal-watching covers everything from microscopic creatures to mammalian giants  But having said this I must admit that I have favoured familiar species or at least species that are relatives of familiar species 
There is no point in explaining behaviour patterns in animals that are extremely difficult to observe  I have largely omitted the microscopic world for example as few people own microscopes 
I have concentrated on the higher forms of life not only because they are easy to observe but also to some extent because they have greater meaning for our own species  We can learn more about ourselves from monkeys than from microbes and looking around our modern human world it is clear that we need to discover as much as we can about ourselves 
As I have said before when writing about human behaviour we are no more than swollen-headed animals and the sooner we accept this fact the safer we will be  As risen apes we have come to dominate this small planet so effectively that we are in danger of smothering it 
There are many lessons we can learn from other animals to our great and continuing advantage and it is high time we took a little while to sit and stare at the other creatures with which we share the earth  They have much to teach us as I hope the following pages will demonstrate 
IT COMES AS A SHOCK to some people to learn that we still do not have definite answers to many of the most obvious questions about animals  Despite the enormous amount of information we have already accumulated there remains a great deal to be learned and this is one of the special pleasures of animal-watching 
There is always the feeling that at any moment something may happen that will lead to a new discovery  And no matter how minor that discovery is there is a peculiar excitement about understanding some natural phenomenon for the first time 
Frequently it is not the case that we have no answer to a question rather we have too many  Each answer seems to have some merit but we can not be certain which is the definitive one 
What is needed is some new observation or insight to clarify the problem  An example will illustrate this 
Everyone knows that the zebra has bold black and white stripes but why does it have them  What function do they serve and how do they help the zebra to survive 
And what can we learn by a little careful zebra-watching  The traditional explanation is that the stripes act as camouflage and help to break up the shape of the animal concealing its body from the eyes of hungry predators 
Despite their vivid appearance when seen in bright sunlight on open grassland the zebras are said to be well camouflaged in broken cover at dawn and dusk when predators are active and the light is dim  One experienced game tracker claimed that it was possible to get to within 40 or 50 yards before spotting a zebra under these conditions and even then it only gave itself away by a small movement such as the swish of its tail or the sudden turn of its head 
Under identical circumstances antelopes were visible up to 200 yards away  This interpretation was accepted for many years but has recently been challenged 
It has been pointed out that the behaviour of zebras simply does not match with this picture of them standing very still in broken cover  Compared with many hoofed animals on the plains of Africa they are remarkably mobile and noisy and never attempt to hide in cover 
On the contrary they prefer to rest in groups out in the open where they can use their acute senses to scan the landscape for tell-tale sounds scents and movements  Their response to danger is to flee as fast as possible rather than freeze or hide 
In other words their natural history does not fit with the explanation that has been repeated in textbooks for decade after decade  So some other answer must be sought 
Certainly a visit to the plains of Africa gives one an immediate impression of how conspicuous the stripes are and how easy it is to spot a herd of zebra in almost any terrain  Perhaps after all they are meant to be seen 
If so why  One explanation is that they are meant to confuse a predator such as a lion the zebra 's chief enemy by creating an optical illusion 
If you compare a striped object with one that has a different kind of black and white pattern they do not appear to be the same size even if in reality they are identical  If the striped pattern breaks against the outline of the object so that its contours are discontinuous its shape is disrupted 
For some strange optical reason this makes it look bigger than it really is and it has been argued that this illusion would have the effect of making an attacking lion misjudge its leap striking short of the true position of the prey  A close scrutiny of films showing lions killing zebras does not bear this out 
When a lion gets close enough to strike it usually does so with great skill and confidence and does not appear to be miscalculating its position to the slightest degree  If zebras escape it is because of their initial alertness then their speed and finally their stamina 
It is the slow ones the young the old and the sick that are caught simply because they are not quick enough over a long enough distance  The traditional view of zebra stripes is that they act as camouflage but even in woodland cover this is not convincing and in any case zebra herds spend most of their time on open grassland where the stripes can not hide them 
Some other function must be sought  A third suggestion is that the black and white stripes dazzle the lion when it gets very close to its prey and make it difficult for the killer to concentrate on its fast-moving victim 
This is the Op Art Principle and anyone who has stood close to a painting by Bridget Riley will understand why dazzle can be a problem to sensitive eyes  The lines seem to shift and shimmer as you look at them and before long you have a powerful desire to look away anywhere but at the painfully dazzling pattern in front of you 
In theory the dazzle explanation makes sense because the zebra patterning is just about as vivid as it can be when seen at close quarters but once again the facts do not support this idea in practice  As with size-confusion there is no evidence that dazzle-confusion puts off a hungry lion which is close enough to experience it 
It has been claimed that the vivid pattern of black and white stripes creates a dazzle effect rather like the Op Art paintings of Bridget Riley and that this disconcerts the attacking predator at close quarters  This is a possibility but in practice there is no evidence for it 
Another suggestion is that the stripes confuse the lion by making it difficult to tell where one zebra ends and another begins  The herd tends to flee together and the stripes are thought to jumble up the individual shapes and make the fleeing herd look like one great mass of black and white patterning 
Since lions always like to isolate one individual from the herd before attacking this theory also makes sense on paper but reality does not bear it out because lions can all too easily single out animals for the kill  This is what happens during a successful chase as one individual falls behind or gets separated in some way from the rest 
Perhaps then the stripes have nothing to do with defence against predators  Perhaps a herd of all-grey zebras would fare no better or worse where killers are concerned 
The answer instead may lie within the world of zebras  Could it be that the stripes are intended not for the eyes of lions but for the eyes of other zebras 
One idea that supports this view sees the stripes as a means for the zebra to identify which species it belongs to  There are three main species surviving today 
Up in the north of the range there is the big Grevy 's zebra with its very fine narrow stripes  Over the whole of the middle of the range there is the common zebra with many local races all with big bold stripes 
And down in the highlands of the south there is the extremely rare mountain zebra with bold but more vertically arranged flank stripes  To human experts it is possible to identify each species at a glance but to more casual observers a zebra is just a zebra and this reflects the weakness of this argument 
For if species identification was the function of the stripes they would have diverged much more in the three cases  If it was important for an individual animal to be able to distinguish between other zebras evolution would have led the three patterns away from one another to a greater degree 
In fact the opposite seems to have occurred because Grevy 's zebra is in other ways a very different animal from the common zebra and it appears that in their stripes the two species have converged rather than diverged over a long period of time  It must be admitted however that there is an exception to this in the rump region of the zebras ' markings 
There each of the three species does have a very different and highly distinctive pattern of markings  In the Grevy 's zebra there is a bold black central stripe surrounded by a bleached-out white area 
In the common zebra the bold striping continues towards the central line  And in the mountain zebra there is an unusual fine grid-iron pattern along the central line 
In these rump displays the general zebra patterning diverges far more than on any other part of the body and it seems that in this restricted region at least species identification is operating  But this can not of course explain the greater similarity in the striping of the rest of the body 
The rump region as is clear by looking at other hoofed animals is the favoured place for species flags of identity and there is a good reason for this  When animals are fleeing in panic they have the greatest need to follow the flag of their own species keeping the herd together 
And when they are fleeing it is of course the rump regions of the other animals that they see most clearly  One theory suggests that the stripes act as a species recognition device 
The striped patterns of the three species of zebras shown opposite common top Grevy 's middle and mountain bottom are not as varied as might be expected if they were important as species-isolating mechanisms  Seen from the side they are at first glance very similar indeed 
Only in the rump region do the stripes markedly differ from species to species This means that when fleeing at speed each zebra can follow its own species flag  Another possibility is that the stripes operate at much closer quarters as a personal identification system 
It is certainly true that no two zebras are exactly alike in the details of their black and white lines  It is as if each animal wears on its skin a giant fingerprint with as much individuality as would be needed for personal recognition 
It is entirely possible that this mechanism does operate and that the members of a herd do use these clues when looking at one another  The weakness in the argument is that a herd of wild horses totally lacking in the striped pattern also has accurate individual identification and every member of every equine herd including all domestic horses is known individually to every other member 
Without such abilities group organisation would be impossible so stripes although useful are by no means essential for this  It is therefore hard to see personal identification as the main evolutionary pressure leading to the famous black and white pattern 
Another theory sees the stripes as a mechanism for personal individual identification rather like fingerprints  This could easily be used by other members of a herd as a way of naming an individual zebra 
A comparison of the markings on the faces of these four drinking zebras confirms how different each pattern is in fine detail  A more ingenious theory claims that the stripes operate as a form of visual bonding between members of each herd 
They are thought to make each zebra feel it belongs more strongly to its group than it would do if its colours were nondescript or dull  The clear vivid patterns excite the zebra 's eyes and give it a sensation of strong identity as if it were the member of a football team or a sports club with conspicuous striped shirts 
Perhaps so but if this is the case why should vertical stripes be selected as the particular zebra pattern  This is where the theory becomes ingenious 
It is argued that zebras unlike antelopes spend a great deal of time grooming one another 's bodies especially in the neck region  It is a friendly act of mutual benefit to the two animals involved since they can not groom themselves in this region 
When they are engaged in this bonding act that helps to cement their friendships their necks twist towards one another and this causes vertical folds or furrows to be formed in their flesh  Because of the way that the two animals stand in relation to one another while grooming is going on it is these vertical lines that are placed slap in front of their nearside eyes 
All the while as they groom they see a vertical pattern of skin-folds  This striping becomes synonymous with social attachment and is therefore the ideal pattern for evolution to exaggerate with contrasting colours 
Once established the pattern could spread all over the body until it reached the condition we know today  This theory could explain the difference between zebras and the plain-coloured antelopes that live alongside them but it fails to give an answer to the obvious question of why wild asses and horses lack stripes 
The arguments that the desert-living wild asses in northern Africa live in such small groups that this type of bonding enhancement would not be needed and that the northern horses have winter coats that are too shaggy for vivid striping are somehow unconvincing  There were undoubtedly much larger herds of wild asses in the past and as for black and white markings being impossible on shaggy cold-country coats it is only necessary to look at the shaggy-coated skunks and pandas to see that this is really not a problem 
A recent explanation is that the stripes are a mechanism for visual bonding  The stimulating pattern is thought to create a feeling of herd membership 
In other words the stripes function in much the same way as the patterns on football shirts in human sports groups  Another equally ingenious theory sees the black and white coats as a display not for predators or for fellow zebras but instead for insect pests 
It is argued that disease-carrying insects and other small pests are reluctant to land on such a strange surface with its intensely white and intensely black patches  The optical effect disturbs them and they flit off to land on some less vivid pattern elsewhere 
In support of this theory is the fact that zebras are much less likely to suffer from certain insect-carried diseases than other equines  Ordinary domestic horses always suffered greatly in tropical Africa and it could simply be that they attract more insects than zebras 
But against this theory it has been argued that over large parts of the zebra 's range insects are not a major problem so without further analysis the idea is once again inconclusive  Finally there is the even more unexpected theory that the black and white striping is essentially a cooling device 
Everyone knows that white clothing is better in the hot sun than black because the black allows more heat to be absorbed  It is claimed that by having sharply separated black and white regions of the skin rotary breezes will be created between the black and white zones and that these will have a cooling effect 
It is pointed out that the extinct quagga a zebra with much less striping came from the far south of Africa where the climate is cooler and that the northern stripeless horses also enjoy cooler weather  In other words the hotter the climate the more striped the equines become 
Unfortunately this theory does not stand up too well eitherâ€“ because the mountain zebra comes from the cooler south and yet has vivid stripes  Also the wild asses from northern Africa survive in some of the hottest places on earth and their bodies are stubbornly stripeless 
A reason why a pattern of vertical stripes might have been selected as a social bonding device is that attachment takes place most strongly during periods of grooming right and this involves a zebra bending its neck creating vertical folds in the skin below the bold stripes could have evolved to augment and elaborate these dark lines  Once established the pattern would then simply have spread to cover the whole animal 
Briefly these are nine theories to explain why zebras have stripes  Each has something to commend it and yet each in turn is not totally convincing 
Nothing could demonstrate more elegantly the fascination there is in studying animals today  The animal world is full of puzzles and half-solved mysteries of this kind 
Every so often a new observation is made a new fact discovered and another theory is formulated  Sometimes it is completely convincing and all the old ideas can be thrown away 
More often it turns out to have weaknesses of its own and many a general theory ends up as tomorrow 's special case explaining something but not everything  In the case of the zebra it is entirely possible that several of the nine mechanisms are working together each supporting the other 
Or it may be that one of them alone is after all the true explanation of the vivid coat of stripes  Alternatively and more excitingly perhaps around the corner there lurks a tenth explanation the true one at last 
We shall see  On the pages that follow I have tried to present the most convincing and widely accepted explanations of all the various animal phenomena that are described there but while reading them it is always healthy to keep an open mind 
Few cases are quite as confusing as the zebra 's stripes but there is always the chance that in a year or so 's time new information will have been gathered that changes our views about some aspect of animal life  If this were not the case it would be a dead subject beautiful perhaps but boring 
And the truth that I insist I have discovered about the animal world is that it is never ever boring  AMONG THE HIGHER forms of life each species has a typical group size at which it functions most efficiently 
Some animals are solitary living on personally defended territories where no other member of their species is permitted to enter  They only relinquish this extreme form of isolation for a brief coming together of the sexes during the breeding season and then return to their separate lives once more 
Other animals pair for life but never congregate into larger groupings  A pair of golden eagles may defend a territory of up to 16 square miles living there in splendid detachment from the remainder of their species 
In stark contrast the red-billed quelea a small African weaver-bird lives in dense roosts of up to ten million individuals  They scatter during the day to feed but reassemble every night in a vast noisy crowd blanketing whole sections of woodland and making the trees almost invisible under their cloak of bodies 
All higher forms of life live in groups of a particular size  Some are solitary while others appear in huge flocks like these flamingos 
Even these feathered locusts are outshone by the real thing  A typical locust swarm can easily contain 40 thousand million individuals and the record swarm one that was said to stretch for 2,000 miles was estimated at about 250 thousand million insects 
An average-sized locust swarm devours in the region of 20,000 tons of vegetation every day  But these are not organised structured animal societies they are abnormal explosions of the locust population and they carry with them the seeds of their own downfall as do modern human populations that are heading in the same direction 
For we like all animal species have an optimum group size and it is one that we have exceeded so dramatically that our species is already well on its way to massive self-destruction  Like locust swarms we will experience a vast population crash at some point one that will drag us back to a more natural level 
But that is another story  In the meantime what are the natural levels of social grouping for other animal species 
The red-billed weaver bird or quelea lives in colonies numbered in the millions right  Each million birds destroys 60 tons of grain every day making this species a major pest of African agriculture rivalled only by the locust above 
Opposite Impressive aggregations can be observed when caterpillars struggle for space in their breeding swarms snakes congregate underground in hibernating masses sharing their slight body heat fish gather in vast protective shoals and butterflies gather in large numbers on their wintering grounds  According to Noah all animals go in twos like the golden eagles but in reality there are several basic social units of which the isolated pair is only one example 
To classify these units into different types is inevitably an over-simplification but it is nevertheless a helpful exercise  The adult males and females live alone and meet only in the breeding season 
After courtship and copulation they split up again and have no further relations until the next season  The female deals with the young without the help of the male or in certain cases the male rears the young without the help of the female 
The solitary adults may wander over vaguely defined home ranges or they may restrict themselves to clearly defined and defended territories  Animals that fall into this general category include many territorial fish such as the river bullhead many reptiles especially snakes a few birds such as the ruff and many mammals such as bears pandas and raccoons 
With birds and mammals it is nearly always the female that looks after the young without the help of the male but many fish reverse this procedure with all parental duties being carried out by the males as in the case of nest-building sticklebacks and pouch-carrying seahorses  Wherever the parental duties are too much for one parent the male and female form a strong attachment for one another and live together as a bonded pair 
Nesting fish like many cichlids form pairs that share the parental duties equally and the same is true of over go per cent of all bird species where incubation and feeding duties are particularly demanding  Pair-bonds are comparatively rare in reptiles and although they are typical of certain mammals such as beavers jackals foxes and gibbons this is not the typical mammalian grouping 
Female mammals are better at caring for their young without male assistance and where it is necessary there tends to be a larger group than just a single pair  Many animals such as the puma are solitary for most of the year only coming together with other members of their species at mating time 
For the rest of the year they wander their home ranges or defend their territories against all-comers  This is merely an extension of the pair 
When the young arrive they often remain with the parents until they are fully or nearly fully grown  During the later stages of their development to adulthood they frequently move about with their parents and at this stage create a larger grouping 
Occasionally there may be overlapping litters with older offspring remaining while new babies are being cared for  In such cases the extended family begins to look quite complex but it is still essentially based upon the original pair and when young do become fully adult they are driven away or wander off on their own to form separate pairs 
Whenever parental duties require the attentions of both mother and father pair-formation takes place opposite top  When a young female black-backed jackal first comes into heat she is followed by several young males one of which she selects as her long-term partner 
Later when she is denbound with cubs he will bring food to her and the pair will then rear their cubs together  Once the young are born they may be cared for by both their parents for many days 
During this period the family unit becomes the natural social grouping as it is for these highly protective swans opposite bottom  A prolonged period of family life permits the growing offspring to add individual learning experiences to their inborn behaviour programming 
A typical mammalian grouping consists of one dominant male and a harem of females  The size of the harem varies from species to species 
In polygamous monkeys each male has only a few females but with species such as fur seals the harems can be huge up to one hundred females  Male deer and some antelopes are also capable of collecting and controlling sizable numbers of females in the breeding season but whenever the harem becomes too massive the harem-masters lose control and small splinter-groups of females are stolen by less dominant males in the vicinity 
The harem system requires of course that a large number of males are unlucky in the breeding season and must remain on the fringe of the reproductive groups  There they may become solitary or may form into bachelor groups 
When the harem-masters become too old or too sick new overlords will emerge from the strongest in the bachelor groups and will take over the females  Inherent in this type of social system is a marked sexual dimorphism with males usually much bigger than females a consequence of the fierce inter-male competition for dominance 
In many species the basic unit is the harem with one dominant male surrounding himself with a number of breeding females  This is true of Hamadryas baboons above fur seals left and red deer opposite top 
The number of females varies from species to species  The fur seal may have up to a hundred but the Hamadryas makes do with only a handful 
Harem-masters are always conspicuously different in appearance from their females frequently they are larger and in many cases they have special male weapons on their heads  As an outcome of the harem system there are many surplus males 
In most harem-forming species these outcasts cluster together in all-male groups  as here in the case of young male red deer opposite bottom 
From their number a new harem-master will one day emerge  Apart from loss of control over females there is also another danger in overinflating the size of the harem 
In some polygamous species such as the patas monkey the males become henpecked  In this species harems of up to twelve females are usual and although the male remains the leader watchdog and defender of the group in clashes with his females he is often the loser 
There are enough of them to gang up on him and dominate him even though he remains the group administrator  Some harems are permanent while others dissolve at the end of the breeding season 
When this happens the individuals may disperse or they may stay together in new groupings  Red deer for instance end the season by splitting up into male herds and female herds each with dominant members 
Then when the next breeding time comes around the males start moving in on the female groups again and fight one another for possession of that year 's harems  By a small shift in the balance of power between the genders the harem system can be converted into a matriarchy 
In this type of grouping the females stay together at the centre of society with the males on the periphery  Instead of the dominant males moving in and taking over the females during the breeding period they are simply allowed in for mating only and then driven out again 
This system is found in species as different as elephants and coatis  When Victorian naturalists first studied the African elephant in the field they were convinced that the dominant member of the herd must be the oldest bull 
This fitted their human concept of the dominant father-figure  But we now know that the dominant leader of the herd is the old matriarch and that the big bulls are forced to live out their lives in solitary splendour on the fringes of elephant society 
Occasionally several males may form loose groups together but whether they do this or not the essential point here is that it is the combined efforts of the females that control the herd and rear and defend the young  Some species have a female-dominated society 
This probably evolved from a harem system where the females combined forces to overpower and drive out the dominant male  This matriarchal system operates in the African elephant where it is the dominant cow that leads the herd 
The herd is made up purely of females and young  Moving up the scale towards more complex social groupings we come to the oligarchy where power is invested in an elite gang of dominant males 
The common baboon belongs to this type of social gathering  Each troop as it moves about its home range consists of several powerful males their shared females and their combined offspring 
Young adult males are driven out of this group and form separate bachelor parties that must bide their time until they can steal young females and set up an oligarchy of their own  The advantage of this arrangement is that it provides an efficient means of defence against predators 
When attacked by a leopard for instance all the dominant males rush towards the attacker and together are able to intimidate it  Singly the leopard would defeat them but together they can drive it away 
They can also help one another to defeat an attack by rival male baboons that are attempting to take over their shared females  Furthermore if one of the females becomes too dominant they can pool their male resources to put her in her place 
This arrangement requires a certain amount of restraint and co-operation on the part of the dominant males but it clearly has compensatory advantages  It is employed by a wide range of species with slight variations 
In some cases there is a strong peck-order operating within the group of males and sometimes also within the group of females  With certain carnivores only the dominant male copulates with the females 
He never gives the other males a chance  In other groups the dominant male gets most of the matings and the other males are allowed an occasional copulation 
Sometimes the dominant female is so powerful that only she becomes pregnant and her subordinates must await her demise before being able to breed themselves  In wolves there is occasionally a drawback to being the top-dog 
If the pack has become too big and unmanageable the dominant male must spend all his time trying to control it  He is often so busy that the less powerful males are able to disappear into a corner and copulate with his favourite females while his back is turned 
This tycoon-failing pattern is one of the factors that makes a more moderate pack-size a better prospect for power-hungry males  In the common baboon unlike the Hamadryas the troop exists as an oligarchy with several dominant males sharing power 
This system is efficient because the males can gang up on attacking predators and their joint efforts are enough to drive them off  There is some degree of division of labour with certain males acting as sentinels 
Some species have developed an all-male grouping of a special kind  In various birds species such as ruffs and black grouse the males all cluster together in the breeding season on a special patch of ground called a lek or arena 
There each displays as vividly as he can  The females visit the arena and select the male of their choice mate with him and then depart to rear the young on their own 
This is dealt with in more detail in the chapter on arena displays  A social hierarchy peck-order or social dominance grouping consists of individuals that are ranked according to their status 
Whereas territorial individuals are dominant in their own area but subordinates in other areas hierarchically grouped individuals have the same status wherever they go  Their rank is determined not by place but by person 
Some individuals manage to intimidate all their companions and rise to the top of the peck-order  Others sink to the bottom 
This arrangement can become part of a reproductive grouping but it is also frequently observed in non-breeding groups where a hierarchy develops in relation to food sources  The top animals can displace the bottom ones at feeding sites and gain other environmental advantages by virtue of being tougher than their group companions 
In non-breeding groups the size of the gathering can swell and swell especially during migrations of the type seen in wildebeest and salmon  There when animals are on the move there is little social structure merely a mass of advancing animals 
The huge conglomerates that assemble on such occasions provide us with some of the greatest spectacles in the animal world  Vast swarms of insects endless shoals of fish huge herds of antelopes and sky-filling migrations of birds all reach dramatic proportions and defy accurate counting 
Among social insects there exist extremely complex social organisations in which there are different classes of individuals providing an efficient division of labour  Termites ants bees and wasps display various forms of this caste system all of which show a level of social differentiation that can not be found among any vertebrate species other than man himself 
There are queens kings workers soldiers and drones each with a separate task to perform  Together they create a large nest operate it smoothly and defend it against all enemies 
Among the social insects dense aggregations occur but without the loss of complex social organisation  Bees wasps ants and termites exhibit extraordinary degrees of division of labour with separate castes comprising such categories as kings queens workers slaves drones and soldiers 
These are the ten basic types of social grouping  For the animal-watcher the fascination is in finding new variants of these themes 
So often a species appears at first glance to be a standard version of one of these ten categories  Then on closer inspection it emerges that there are oddities in this particular instance as there are in so many cases and the quest is on to identify the survival value of these particular idiosyncrasies 
Usually it has something to do with the needs created by sharing sharing the task of killing a large prey sharing the task of defending the group against predators sharing body heat to keep warm at night sharing out different duties that can be performed at the same time sharing the food that has been obtained by special members of the group and so on  Each environment and each species throws up its own unique combination of social demands which in turn create the spectrum of variations on the theme of social grouping 
And although we now know the facts for many species of animals it is important to point out that for many more we still have only the crudest knowledge of their grouping behaviour  Much remains to be discovered 
MOST ANIMALS must live out their lives with an ever-present threat of attack from predators  When active they must always be on the alert ready to take avoiding action 
They have three basic strategies to freeze to flee and to fight often in that order  Freezing is a widespread response to a predator alarm among many of the better camouflaged species 
The eyes of predators are finely tuned to the slightest movement but are less well equipped to distinguish static shapes especially if their outlines are blurred by broken patterning or by foliage cover  Some species such as hares and young antelope will stay stock-still in a crouching posture until the predator is almost upon them before bolting 
Anyone who has been walking across grassland and has nearly trodden on a hare will know what a shock it is when the animal suddenly leaps up and darts off  It is gone even before the predator can gather its wits and make chase 
When under attack from a predator the three basic responses of animals are to freeze flee or fight  In the bittern above and the hare left freezing is the most common form of defence 
At the first sign of danger the bittern adopts a rigid stiffly erect posture making itself almost invisible in the vegetation around its nest  The hare crouches low on the ground and remains absolutely still until the predator is nearly upon it 
Only then does it flee  Even without elaborate camouflage markings this immobility is of great value to prey species because the eyes of prowling killers are more sensitive to movements than to static shapes 
Some prey species such as tree squirrels add a refinement to their freezing behaviour  As soon as they sight a predator approaching they swiftly dart round to the far side of a tree-trunk before performing the rigid statue response 
Freezing on the trunk they are now completely hidden from view and make no tell-tale sound  If the killer comes prowling around to their side of the tree they simply dart to the blind side again 
In this way squirrels in a wood can remain hidden from view while a predator explores the whole region  Woodpeckers use a similar hiding technique 
For the animal-watcher this strategy only becomes obvious when from a hidden viewpoint it is possible to see the predator approaching from the far side of the prey  Then the trick is revealed all too clearly 
If freezing fails to work then the next step is to flee  Many prey species have developed amazingly fast escape actions 
The speed of some of these have been carefully measured  Some deer have managed bursts of 40 miles an hour and antelopes have reliably reached over 50 miles an hour 
The fastest predator is the cheetah which can touch nearly 60 miles an hour at its best but it can not sustain this for very long  In fact the average distance covered during pursuits by cheetahs is only 183 yards 
In exceptional cases they may be able to continue for 300 yards but beyond this they quickly become exhausted and give up  This is where the prey can score because they can keep going for much longer 
Some antelopes have been recorded fleeing at 42 miles an hour for a mile or 35 miles an hour for 4 miles and deer have been able to sustain 30 miles an hour for an astonishing 20 miles  This may seem excessive in relation to the cheetah 's performance but there are other predators with much greater stamina 
Wolves and hunting dogs may not be able to reach dramatically high speeds over short distances but they can run and run  The speed of one wolf was recorded at between 1 5 and 30 miles an hour for a distance of 12 miles after which the animal had to slow down to a trot 
Tundra wolves have been observed chasing deer for 5 or 6 miles before accelerating to attack  Clearly prey need to be both sprinters over short distances and marathon runners over longer ones to be able to defend themselves against both types of pursuers 
The secret against sprinting predators such as the big cats is to get a good start on them  As they are marginally faster the ability to begin fleeing before they have had a chance to accelerate to full speed is crucial 
Hence the ever-alert nature of so many antelopes  They must always be on the lookout for the stalking feline hunter whose aim is to get as close as possible before beginning the chase 
Once the pursuit is on it is simply a matter of whether the killer will start to tire before it manages to reach its victim  With wild dogs in pursuit it is a different matter 
Then it is a battle of relative staminas who will last the longest  If attacks come from above running fast is less effective 
Birds of prey have been registered nose-diving at speeds of up to 1 l 0 miles an hour  The best defence here is to go underground as quickly as possible 
The main prey of predatory birds are the hundreds of different rodent species and the vast majority of these have evolved a protection system based on a quick scamper down a tunnel  The burrow has become their main survival device saving them not only from swooping birds but also from earthbound predators too large to follow them 
Some prey species such as the oryx opposite top rely on simple powerful galloping to escape their pursuers but others such as the impala below employ a more confusing zigzag escape route with sudden directional changes making it difficult for the pursuing attacker to strike  Opposite bottom Many prey species have developed unusually long legs and strange forms of locomotion as refinements of their fleeing behaviour 
Bipedal leaping in kangaroos and bipedal sprinting in frilled lizards help to make their flight more startling and unpredictable  Many other prey species flee upwards to safety rather than downwards 
Arboreal rodents primates and many other mammals take to the trees as an escape route and the majority of them rarely risk a descent to the ground unless it is vitally necessary  Birds bats and gliding mammals simply take to the air 
Many of the most impressive forms of animal locomotion have evolved as extensions of fleeing actions  There are several refinements of fleeing behaviour 
Instead of trying to escape by moving as fast as possible away from the predator some animals take an erratic zigzag course  The hare flees across a field in this way and a number of different birds and fish have also been seen to use this technique 
It works on the principle that the pursuer will not be able to change direction as efficiently as the prey  To be successful the direction-shifts of the fleeing animal must be irregular so that the predator can not anticipate either when or in which direction the next change of course will be 
Unpredictable escape patterns of this kind have been called protean defence systems because like the figure of Proteus in ancient Greek mythology they repeatedly change their shape  The hare pursued here by a goshawk is a master of unexpected movements when fleeing 
Another technique is the dash-and-hide dash-and-hide retreat  This is employed by animals such as frogs and grasshoppers that can not sustain a prolonged bout of fleeing 
They make a sudden darting movement at the highest possible speed and then quickly freeze staying quite still in the undergrowth  If the predator takes a wrong direction they remain in hiding until the danger is passed but if it comes close again they wait until the last moment and then repeat the dash-and-hide movement 
They may keep this up time and time again until with luck the predator finally gives up the chase  Chasing prey through the tree-tops is much more hazardous than pursuing them along the ground as this raccoon-hunting puma is discovering below 
Many species have taken to arboreal living as a protective device and some such as this sugar-glider opposite have become specialised jumpers that can leave most predators behind with ease  A third device is the flash retreat 
In this the prey flashes a bright patch of colour as it flees and then it suddenly freezes concealing the bright patch as it does so  Some grasshoppers have vividly coloured patches on their wings and these are clearly visible when they are flying away from their enemies 
But as soon as they come to rest the wings close and the animals become completely cryptic again  This confuses the predator because it has tuned in so to speak to the bright colour and is following that 
Once the colour disappears it is as if the prey animal has suddenly ceased to exist  If fleeing and hiding have failed and the prey finds itself cornered by its would-be killer it may make one last desperate attempt to save itself by throwing caution to the wind and attacking the predator physically 
In most cases this will not be of much use but at this stage there is nothing to lose  And predators are surprisingly nervous about sustaining even minor injuries 
This is because should they be wounded or should a small cut become infected they may temporarily lose peak condition  If they are not athletically fit they may not be able to hunt for a while and this could be critical as most of them must kill regularly to survive 
So a snarling spitting clawing prey is given rather more respect than it may appear to deserve  Many a hungry cat has thought twice about attacking a large cornered rat 
Many small birds have escaped with the loss of only a few feathers because of a smartly delivered peck with a sharp beak  And animals with horns have sometimes managed to toss their tormentors high in the air when making a last-ditch stand 
For some prey it becomes a matter of safety in numbers with musk oxen forming up in a defensive circle to face a pack of marauding wolves like a wagon train defending itself against attacking Indians  With these three techniques of freezing fleeing and fighting many prey manage to survive for another day but there are also more specialised ways of dealing effectively with attackers and these are discussed in more detail in the following chapters 
Opposite top Self-defence for a rhinoceros may be little more than casting a sleepily arrogant eye on the hungry lions surrounding it for an agitated elephant on the other hand it may be a vigorous charge  Horned prey such as these musk oxen opposite bottom are only armoured at their front end so that their rear needs special protection 
The herd solves this problem by forming a defensive circle when marauding wolves attack  If fleeing fails and the prey is cornered it may make a last-ditch stand and turn on its tormentor 
Self-defence of this kind may be no more than a threat as in the case of the inflated toad standing high on its legs when confronted by a grass snake above or the frilled lizard right which erects a huge umbrella of skin around its gaping jaws  THE ANIMAL WORLD is so full of savage teeth sharp claws and pointed horns that many species have sought protection behind a powerful wall of body armour 
Once they possess this their whole lifestyle is transformed  Gone is the need for speedy athletic fleeing gone the need for eternal alertness and high-strung sensitivity to every tiny hint of danger 
They become comfortably heavy-bodied even cumbersome and bumble their way through life at a more relaxed pace  They are the tanks of the animal kingdom and they come in many forms 
Among the mammals they are comparatively rare  Only 169 mammalian species which is roughly 4 per cent of the 4,237 living species can boast any form of armoured protection 
It is true that there are many species with horns or antlers but those are primarily concerned with offence and are only secondarily employed as defensive armour against predators  They are weapons rather than protective coverings 
The most primitive of the armoured mammals are the five species of echidnas or spiny anteaters from Australasia  Their underside is soft and hairy but the whole of their upper surface is covered in strong thick spines 
When disturbed they make for a crevice or hole where they can jam themselves in so tight with their powerful claws that it is almost impossible to dislodge them  All the attacker is offered is a sea of spines with nothing to grip on to 
If caught out in the open the echidna simply digs rapidly downwards until again nothing is visible but its spiky upper surface  The echidna Australia 's spiny anteater protects itself by digging rapidly downwards until its soft underside is completely hidden and its enemy is offered only a sea of powerful sharp spikes 
Among the insectivores there are eight species of spiny tenrecs from Madagascar and fifteen species of hedgehogs from Europe Africa and Asia  The tenrecs look very much like the hedgehogs and have a similar defensive armour with fine spines that can be erected as the animal rolls into a tight ball 
Some of the hedgehogs embellish their self-protection with an upward jerking movement  If a predator is nosing close to them and they have not yet rolled tightly into a ball they may bend and then suddenly straighten their legs thrusting their spiny backs up into the killer 's sensitive nose 
This upward jerk can be very painful and is sometimes enough to dishearten the attacker and allow the hedgehog to scuttle away to safety without having to resort to the passive rolling-up defence  In addition to these spiny insectivores there are two other armoured species the extraordinary hero shrews 
Outwardly these look like large furry shrews but internally they carry a secret defence their amazing reinforced backbone  Unlike the spinal column of any other mammal it has a network of interlocking protrusions from its vertebrae that gives it enormous strength and resistance to crushing 
Confined to West Africa these species of shrews have been persecuted locally because of their strange internal armour  Local natives believe that eaten or worn as decoration they will act as protection from injury 
To demonstrate the power of the animals a fully grown man stands on the back of the 6-inch-long shrew balancing himself on one leg  Any other small mammal of this size would quickly be squashed to death but when he steps off it after several minutes the hero shrew reveals that it is still very much alive by trying to escape 
The mystery about this particular form of protective armour is precisely what the shrew is defending itself against  Humans were clearly not the primeval enemy that led to the evolution of this unique backbone so which deadly crusher was involved 
This is a puzzle that has yet to be answered  The hero shrew has an armoured backbone that can withstand enormous pressure 
The hedgehog can not dig itself in when threatened but it can protect its soft parts by rolling up into a tight ball  Its seven thousand spines then defend it in all directions 
The spines also act as shock-absorbers if the animal suffers a fall  Another mystery surrounds the only example of body armour to be found among the primates 
The more advanced monkeys or apes do not have any kind of protective armour and use brain rather than brawn to solve their problems but the slow-moving little relative of the bushbabies known as Bosman 's potto does have a secret defence rather like the hero shrew 's  Here too the backbone is modified and made more impressive but the details are different 
In the potto 's case the neck vertebrae have short blunt vertical protrusions that project slightly through the skin  The result is a kind of knuckle-duster a row of hard bumps hidden deceptively in the soft dense fur 
The puzzle here is how the animal employs these obviously defensive spikes when in trouble  When the slow-moving potto is approached by an enemy it curls up into a tight ball clings on to its branch and lowers its head between its legs so that the back of its spiky neck is thrust towards the predator 
But this hardly seems sufficient as an armoured defence to deter any but the most casual of killers  Perhaps as the attacker 's jaws open wide to grab the small furry shape the potto acts like a jerking hedgehog and thrusts the back of its neck at the biting mouth 
Possibly the shock of feeling hard spikes in what appeared to be a soft yielding morsel of food would be enough to make some predators think twice but this is not particularly convincing  If the spikes were sharp like the dorsal fins of many fish the strategy would be easy to understand but their shortness and bluntness mean that for the moment the potto remains another puzzle 
Sharper spines including the most fiendish known  are to be found among the rodents 
In this huge group 1,729 species there are many armoured examples 18 kinds of spiny mice 22 spiny pocket mice 37 spiny rats and 24 porcupines  The mice and rats have simple slender spines mixed in with their ordinary fur 
Although they are not completely spiny they are nevertheless prickly enough to repel all but the most desperate of predators  It is with the porcupines however that the spiny defensive system reaches its zenith 
Here the spikes can become enormous quills those of the great crested porcupine are as long as 20 inches  They can be rattled to produce a menacing warning sound they can be thrust violently into the flesh of the attacker by backward lunges of the porcupine 's body and they can easily be detached to be left embedded in the unfortunate predator 's anatomy 
Once driven home these savage spines are extremely difficult to dislodge and may continue to torment the would-be killer for days to come sometimes leading to festering wounds that can kill  This spiny mouse is one of 101 species of prickly rodents but it is the least spectacular 
At first glimpse it may not even appear to be armoured but if the animal is taken into a predator 's mouth its fur is sufficiently spiky to cause acute discomfort and it is quickly dropped  The most dramatic of the spiny rodents are the heavily armoured porcupines 
The South American porcupines below left may not look as impressive as the great crested species from Africa below right but their quills are sharply barbed so that once they have entered a predator 's flesh they can not easily be removed  Less spectacular but even more deadly are the spines of the American porcupines 
These spines are covered in small backward-directed barbs so that once in the flesh they are almost impossible to dislodge  Furthermore the pain caused by the presence of an embedded spine makes the muscles it has penetrated contract in such a way that it is driven even deeper into the flesh 
Some barbed quills have reputedly travelled so deep into the bodies of their victims that they have caused the deaths of the predators from the extensive damage caused to vital internal organs  It has been calculated that the 1Â½-inch quills penetrate tissue in this way at a rate of an inch a day 
The North American porcupine 's method of defending itself is to lash wildly at the enemy with its spiny tail sometimes turning the predator 's nose into a pin-cushion  The only killer that seems to have much success in dealing with this troublesome prey is the North American marten known as the fisher 
This species circles the porcupine like a mongoose dealing with a cobra and confuses it enough to be able to strike at its only vulnerable zone its head  After a few blows there the porcupine succumbs and is then turned carefully over and eaten from underneath its soft underbelly causing no problems 
Eventually all that is left is the spiny coat  The spines of the African porcupines regularly encountered by lions may not be barbed 
like those of the South American porcupines but they are nevertheless difficult to remove and this particular lion faces a painful future  Mammals with non-spiny armour include the twenty-one species of armadillos and the seven species of pangolins or scaly anteaters 
The upper skin of the armadillo 's body has evolved into a hard horny covering that is hinged in such a way as to give the animals at least some degree of flexibility  The hinges are arranged in bands across the middle of the back and vary in number according to the species 
When alarmed these animals usually try to make for cover seeking out their burrows or some other hiding place where they can wedge themselves in as tightly as possible  The smallest of the species the pink fairy armadillo possesses one of the most extraordinary rumps in the animal kingdom 
Its rear end has become a completely flat circular disc of armour  When the little animal is disturbed it burrows furiously down into the ground until it has completely disappeared except for its horny rump 
This acts like a cork in a bottle stopping the borrow and preventing any attack on the soft flesh beneath it  The most impressive of all the armadillo species when responding to attack is the three-banded 
This animal rolls up into an almost perfect ball with the top of the head and the top of the tail fitting close together like the last pieces of a jigsaw puzzle leaving no gap anywhere for a predator to probe  As an added deterrent this species usually waits until the last moment for the final clamping-down movement 
It rolls up so that the gaps between its different parts are nearly closed but a small opening is left  Then when it is touched it immediately snaps the shells together like a steel trap 
If at this point a tender nose-tip or small paw is being probed into the cracks the result is both painful and startling encouraging a more cautious approach to this difficult object of interest  The armadillos are all confined to the Americas 
In the Old World they have a counterpart in the form of the strange scaly anteaters the pangolins  Looking like huge animated pine-cones these unusual animals are covered in large overlapping scales that extend right down to the tip of the long prehensile tail 
When disturbed they roll up so tightly that it is virtually impossible to unroll them  Although well protected against most predators they are no match for human ingenuity 
Their flesh is popular with many local peoples and their scales are valuable as ornaments and decorations with the result that their numbers have been dwindling  Equally vulnerable to human weapons are the armoured giants of the animal world the rhinos and the elephants 
The most impressive of the rhinos is the great Indian rhinoceros with its tough skin thrown into heavy folds that look like curved welded sections of sheet-metal  Even the tail is carefully protected fitting snugly into a deep groove on the animal 's rump where two sheets of armour meet in a vertical cleft 
Elephants lack these conspicuous folds but they too are well defended against attack by their powerful leathery skin which is sometimes as much as an inch thick  The great Indian rhinoceros carries a heavy burden in armoured skin 
This is a handicap when racing a pursuing predator but at the same time makes the rhinoceros an almost impossible meal  Even its tail is protected from attack fitting neatly into a slot in its rump armour 
Among the birds body-armour is absent for the obvious reason that it would make them too heavy to fly  Only the large ground-living cassowaries from the Australasian rain forests possess anything that could be called avian armour and even there it is confined solely to the head region 
The top of the skull is extended into a bony helmet called a casque that helps to cut a swathe through the dense undergrowth when the big bird is moving fast  It shields the head from damage and can therefore be described as protective armour of a limited kind 
Rolling into a hard scaly ball is a device employed by a variety of armoured animals including the pangolin from Africa and Asia top the three-banded armadillo from South America and the giant pill millipede from Madagascar right  The penalty for possessing this effective armour-plating is a disproportionately heavy body and a loss of physical flexibility 
Only the legs of birds show the tough scaly skin that reflects their reptilian ancestry  It is to the reptiles themselves one must turn to find the greatest display of armoured scales that are all-enveloping protecting their wearers over the whole surface of the body 
Each scale is a hard dry shield of keratin growing out from the animal 's epidermis and overlapping with its neighbours to make a body-covering that is as snugly fitting as it is strong  The keratin is dead material that is replaced by growth from below 
The old armour is either worn away gradually as in crocodiles or it is shed at special times in a complete coat as in lizards and snakes  The strongest forms of reptilian armour are reinforced by small plates of bone lying under the horny scales 
These are at their most impressive on the backs of the giant crocodiles where they are lozenge-shaped and give these formidable reptiles the appearance of being covered in spiked metal armour-plating  Body-armour is rare among birds but the ground-living cassowary opposite carries a powerful helmet on its head that acts as a protective shield when the bird pushes through rough undergrowth 
The scaly skin of reptiles is ideally suited for development into sharply spiked armour  The armoured scales become extended into thorny backs horny heads and spiny frills 
Some species such as the armadillo lizard above left make predatory attacks even more difficult by biting their tails and holding tight creating an awkward circle of spikes  The thorny devil above relies simply on its immensely sharp and powerful spikes for protection while the bearded lizard left defends itself by erecting its spiny throat skin 
Certain lizards take the spiky defence trend a major step further with long sharp spines growing out of their scaly skins  As painful to bite as cacti spiny lizards such as the mountain devil or the horned toad are almost impossible to swallow without serious damage to the health of the predator 
Among the tortoises and turtles the overlapping scales have been replaced by a large thick armoured box of horn  In certain species this can be shut tight as a further protection with the head and legs being drawn behind the barrier 
Some have a hinge to close the head-end aperture others have a hinge to protect the hind legs still others have both  The bigheaded turtle is unique in having a heavily armoured head and tail which it never attempts to draw into its shell when attacked 
In addition to their hard shell tortoises and turtles sometimes possess special protective refinements  The Asiatic spiny turtle left boasts a rim of sharp spikes around the edge of its shell and the pancake tortoise bottom has an unusually flattened shell and body enabling it to slither to safety under low crevices 
The porcupine fish opposite top inflates itself by gulping in water or air if it has been removed from the sea until its body is so puffed up that its spiny scales stand out rigidly from its body and defy any killer to devour it  Amazingly though porcupine fish have often been found among the stomach contents of large tuna 
How the tuna manage to swallow these painful morsels is not known  Amphibians like birds and most mammals have soft bodies that are easily squeezed in predatory jaws 
They rely on many forms of protective behaviour but the wearing of armour is not one of them  There is only one notable exception to this amphibian rule and that is the extraordinary sharp-ribbed newt 
This small and seemingly harmless creature carries a hidden weapon  When it is grabbed its elongated sharp-pointed ribs are pressed out through the sides of its body and into the lining of the mouth of the hapless hunter 
The tips of the spiny ribs pass through special pores as they impale the predator and they carry with them the secretions of nearby glands glands that cause intensely painful poisoning of the inside of the attacker 's mouth  Such newts are long remembered and long avoided 
Opposite middle Anyone who has dined on crab or lobster will know how well the hard carapace of these animals protects their soft flesh  But like all armoured animals they have sacrificed flexibility for security and must now be content with a stiffly jointed existence 
The greatest armour in the world of molluscs is found on the giant clam opposite a bivalve whose shell weighs Â¼ ton and is over 4 feet in length  Although this amazing armour protects the soft body of the clam extremely well the animal is not the killer it is so often made out to be 
Countless stories exist of swimmers whose feet become trapped inside giant clams that snap shut suddenly and then refuse to release their victims  This myth is believed all over the world despite the fact that the weight of the armour makes it impossible for the clam to close rapidly 
There is no recorded example of a giant clam causing a human death  Many species of fish employ similar defence tactics with fin-rays hardened into sharp spines which are often greatly elongated and frequently have poison added making a lasting impression 
Some fish boast armour so deadly that the predator dies within minutes of biting the spines  Observations of predatory fish attacking spiny prey reveal that after one experience of even a non-poisonous species the predators are so shocked by the pain inside their mouths that they go off their food for days 
Eventually when they begin cautiously to feed again they avoid anything remotely like the spiny prey they attacked previously  And the bigger and sharper the spines the longer this effect lasts 
The supreme example of spiny defence is shown by the porcupine fish a small inflatable creature that can puff itself up into a prickly sphere either with an intake of water when under the surface or with air when it has been caught and removed from the sea  As its body becomes fully inflated all its spines protrude menacingly defying any predator to attack 
At other times these spines lie flat against the body and are inconspicuous  Spines are common among the lower forms of life and are clearly the most successful of all armoured devices 
There are treacherous spiny sea urchins spiny molluscs and spiny lobsters all well protected by their sharp-pointed defence barriers  Even without spines nearly all arthropods prawns crabs and lobsters and molluscs snails and bi-valves are snugly enclosed in hard outer coverings 
Their shells provide them with valuable protection but like all armoured species they are at certain disadvantages they are nearly always less mobile less flexible and suffer the consequences  They are also less cunning and exploratory having less danger to face than the soft-bodied species 
In general  armoured animals are like rich people insulated from the real hazards of life and therefore less streetwise' and opportunist 
It is no accident that all the higher forms of life all the most intelligent species are without armour  The bumbling nature of armoured animals is neatly summed up by an anecdote concerning a family of three-banded armadillos 
They were trotting along a path on the side of a hill when they detected a man walking below them  When they immediately reacted with their automatic alarm response of rolling up into a tight ball the entire family promptly rolled down the slope of the hill and came to rest at the man 's feet where he picked them up and popped them into his collecting bag 
Sometimes it pays to be a little more flexible  The long spines of the sea urchins protect them from most predators 
However this sea star like many starfish is capable of devouring these armoured animals  It can protrude from its body a soft slimy stomach which then glides between the spines and invades the centre of the sea urchin The victim 's body is slowly digested before the stomach is withdrawn again to the interior of the sea star 
IF AN ANIMAL is to survive it must either confront predators or avoid them  If it possesses some sort of strength physical chemical or armoured it can face up boldly to its enemies and defy them 
If it is harmless tasty or soft-bodied it must find some way of concealing itself  Under duress it may flee and hide but it can only do this occasionally 
For the rest of the time the quieter moments in its life it must render itself inconspicuous  It must conceal its form with some sort of camouflage 
The most obvious clue to its presence is its movement so in order for its camouflage to work it must be prepared to remain very still for long periods of time or at least to alter its position very slowly and gently  Its next problem is how to conceal its characteristic outline 
Most animals are bi-laterally symmetrical and their shape is too balanced to match with the irregularities of backgrounds made up of plants rocks and earth  To hide their clear outlines they need some kind of disruptive markings 
There are several types of disruption  One of them employs a psychological trick 
If an animal is covered with irregular patches that break up its outline the concealment can be improved by the presence of bright colours within these patches  These intense areas automatically draw the eyes of the predator and as he stares at them he fails to notice the larger shape which carries them 
This is the Harlequin Principle and is vividly expressed on the body of the harlequin sweetlips a fish that appears to the eye as a collection of coral reef growths  Another type of disruption employs a series of intense bands or stripes that pass right across the animal 
These are nearly always pale and dark in alternation and again help to chop up the animal 's basic shape  If the animal is seen against a pale background the pale patches blend in with the environment leaving only the dark patches visible 
On their own these do not add up to an animal shape and disruption is achieved  If the background changes to dark the same system operates 
This is the Particoloured Principle and is found in a wide variety of fish and insects  A third type of disruption helps to conceal particular parts of the body 
Certain anatomical shapes such as legs arms necks feet or wings tend to give the game away  They help to define the prey 's body as a body 
A valuable way of concealing them is to have bars stripes or blobs of colour that appear to overflow from one section to the next as though someone has splashed ink across the animal  This Splash Principle is finely developed in many frogs 
When they are moving about and their legs are held apart from the body the splash-pattern is not obvious but once they crouch motionless with their legs drawn up to their sides their trunk and leg patches meet and obscure the divisions between them  Most disruption works by making continuous outlines appear to be discontinuous but the Splash Principle operates in the opposite way making what is in reality a discontinuous surface appear to be a continuous one 
In both cases the camouflage is interfering with the natural elements but in one case it is attacking the whole shape while in the other it is blotting out the appendages  Spots stripes and dappled markings help to disguise the presence of many animals 
This small glass frog guarding its eggs on a large green leaf combines a semi-transparent body with a spotted skin that renders it almost invisible to its enemies  The Splash Principle the dark markings on this grey tree frog spread across its legs in such a way that they break up its shape 
They look as though they have been splashed across the skin  More generalised disruptive markings which simply break up the broad shape of the body are found in the many spotted or striped species 
Big cats such as the tiger employ stripes that work well in the grassy undergrowth  Serval cats ocelots and leopards favour spotted coats that work well in dappled light 
To human eyes many of the body markings appear to be beautiful and highly conspicuous but this is because we so often see them in artificial environments where their camouflage quality fails to show itself  Seen against a plain bleak background most disruptive patterns fail miserably but there are few such backdrops in nature 
One highly specialised form of disruptive pattern is the eye-mask  This takes the form of a stripe band or patch of dark colour that runs right through the eye and effectively makes it invisible 
The eye is the most tell-tale detail of any animal shape and it is a great advantage to be able to obscure it from view  If the eye 's owner employs the more obvious technique of closing the eye it is no longer able to monitor the predator 's movements 
But if the eye can remain open without being seen then the prey has the best of both worlds  This eye-mask device is extremely common among fish with literally hundreds of species employing it and it is also widely seen in snakes and frogs 
A special variant of the eye-mask is the spot-the-eye pattern of certain fish  In this the markings consist of a pattern of dark spots all of which look like the dark pupil of the fish 's eye 
In this crowd of spots the real eye is lost  A distinct form of concealment involves camouflage by countershading 
This works on a completely different principle from disruptive colouring  Instead of trying to break up the real shape of the animal it attempts to make it appear flatter than it is 
All animals have three-dimensional bodies and their solidity can give them away  If they appear to be two-dimensional they suddenly seem less animal-like and may avoid the unwelcome attentions of a hungry predator 
Countershading operates on a simple premise namely that in the animal 's usual position one part of its body is more brightly lit than the rest  A completely plain fawn-coloured antelope standing in a fawn-coloured landscape would appear to be solid-bodied because the sun beating down on its back would illuminate this area more than its sides and much more than its belly 
In many species the natural coat colouring compensates for this top-lighting the back being darker than the sides and the sides darker than the belly  In this way the combination of light-plus-colour gives the animal a flat undifferentiated appearance and renders it much less conspicuous to predatory eyes 
The same principle is at work in some caterpillars except that since they are usually crawling along twigs and branches upside-down their counter-shading is reversed  If they are deliberately turned up the right way they appear doubly solid as the brighter light strikes the paler area 
The spots of the leopard opposite lurking in the long grass help to destroy the solidity of its form and the dappled patches on the coat of the clouded leopard above left conceal it well in the broken light of the forest  Even the huge bulk of the tiger above is inconspicuous as the animal lies quietly on the forest floor 
The simplest method of all where body concealment is concerned is to match perfectly the colour of the background  Whether this is a plain green or yellow or an overall mottled grey and brown the result is a body-covering of precisely the same hue and tone 
Tiny pure green frogs live out their lives on large pure green leaves  Nothing more elaborate is called for 
Arctic mammals and birds have evolved pure white fur or feathers that help to camouflage them against the white expanses of the frozen north  Gravel-bottom-dwelling fish have gravel-pattern colours 
But the problem often becomes more complex than this  As the animal moves about its background changes 
Dealing with this problem many species have evolved various forms of colour change  Some like flatfish and chameleons are capable of changing colour rapidly by expanding and contracting special pigment cells in their skin 
The octopus can even modify the texture of its skin at high speed a smooth plain surface suddenly furrowing up into complex folds and ridges and gaining a complex blotched patterning at the same time  Other species are only capable of undergoing such changes at a much slower rate as when birds moult in and out of their breeding plumage 
In the mating season finding a partner is more important than camouflage and bright colours are moulted in but during the rest of the year self-protection dominates and camouflage returns  Disruptive markings help to break up the shape of an animal 's body in any environment that is full of irregular detail as in the case of this well concealed crab 
The trumpet fish is a lurking predator that often hides in shoals of smaller fish  When natural light falls on an animal 's body from above it illuminates the upper surface more than the lower 
As a result many species such as this predatory trumpet fish are counter-shaded their undersides are lighter than their backs  This compensates for the top-lighting. making the animals look flatter and less conspicuous 
When artificially illuminated from below the effect of the countershading is reversed the trumpet fish looks strikingly solid and highly conspicuous  The colours of certain other species can be modified only when there is a genetic shift in their population 
This has happened recently with the peppered moth a speckled species that is camouflaged on the lichen-covered tree-trunks where it normally lives  Following the Industrial Revolution many trees became blackened by smoke and on these the speckled moths were suddenly highly conspicuous 
They were an obvious target for hungry birds and were easily picked off  Only moths that were unusually dark managed to escape and these then bred to produce a generally greyer strain of peppered moths 
Again it was the darkest ones that survived best with the result that in a few generations the peppered moths living near the big industrial cities were nearly all black  By 1900 a survey near the city of Manchester revealed that there 99 per cent of all the peppered moths were already black while those continuing to live in cleaner country districts retain the usual speckled appearance of the species 
In a very short space of time just a few decades the industrial moths had gone through a small but distinct evolutionary step  Today the melanistic moths are still thriving in the grimier habitats and if our cities go on spreading at their present rate these black ones may well become the common form of the species 
In tropical seas a few fish such as this leafy sea dragon have evolved bizarre extensions of their bodies transforming them to look like small floating pieces of seaweed  The tell-tale clue for many a predator is the circular eye of its prey 
Because of this certain species such as this banded butterfly fish possess an eye-stripe a dark line that passes through the eye and hides its presence  Perhaps the most extraordinary examples of animal camouflage are those in which the animals concerned have evolved into mimics of specific details in their backgrounds 
There are insects that look exactly like green leaves  Others are virtually indistinguishable from the flowers with which they associate so much so that smaller insects keep settling on them 
There are stick insects that look like twigs butterflies that resemble bird droppings seahorses that appear to be pieces of floating seaweed moths that look like bark and frogs that seem to be nothing more than leaf litter on the forest floor  The tiny perfections of detail in these deceptions have puzzled some animal-watchers who argue that no predator could be that clever so why should there be these amazing refinements which may include such things as small patches of fake leaf-mould or tiny pieces of leaf damage' 
The answer is that these deceptions have to fool all possible predators and while some may be able to tune in to one detail others may have a searching-image for something quite different  In the end the only system that works well across the board is the one that involves perfect imitation 
One last camouflage technique that deserves a brief mention is what might be called half-hiding  Instead of fleeing to a safe place and hiding away there with complete body concealment the animal takes up a semi-hidden position from which it can remain watchful 
Certain snakes and lizards are highly efficient at wriggling themselves down into the sand or gravel in such a way that only the tops of their heads and their eyes remain exposed to view  With the rest of their bodies submerged their eyes go unnoticed 
Lying completely still they can see without being seen  Among fish this is a favoured technique with many bottom-dwelling species 
As they land on the seabed flatfish flap up the sand in a sudden flurry of rapid movements and then quickly lie perfectly still  The sand cloud settles on their bodies and obliterates their tell-tale outlines 
With a few deft eye-blinks they can clear their field of vision and watch the world about them for clues of special danger  The most elementary form of camouflage is to match the background perfectly 
When the background is a single colour this is a simple matter as it is for this yellow crab spider crouching in wait for a prey to arrive on the marigold flower  In the polar regions many species such as this ptarmigan have developed a pure white covering 
The Mimicry Principle a tawny frogmouth as a tree-stump and a green shrimp as a plant stem  By copying some detail of their environment many animals become almost impossible for predators to detect 
Some marine species such as the trumpet fish hide in a different way  They are lurkers that escape detection by joining the passing throng 
As a shoal of some other kind of fish swims past the predatory trumpet fish moves into their midst and progresses with them as they make their way around the coral gardens  By this simple device it is able to conceal its highly characteristic body shape and is able to approach more easily its intended prey 
For predators make just as much use of camouflage as do their prey  Whether hunting or hunted the act of concealment is a major survival technique for literally thousands of species 
Half-hiding is a technique adopted by many desert-dwelling species such as this Peringuey 's desert adder  The animal wriggles its body beneath the surface until only the top of the head is exposed 
Then with a watchful eye it can keep a lookout for potential prey without revealing its presence  When the pale trees on which the peppered moth rested became dirty from the grime of the Industrial Revolution only the black variants survived well 
These quickly became the norm  This small evolutionary step of industrial melanism was taken in a mere century 
THE MAJORITY OF ANIMALS are not brightly coloured  Their dull coats make them inconspicuous and they survive by avoiding trouble 
Those that break this rule and display bright colours and vivid patterns are taking a risk  By making themselves obvious to predators they can easily attract unwanted attention 
So for the animal-watcher it becomes a challenge with every brightly coloured species encountered to find out what particular advantage there is in giving up the quiet life and facing daily exposure  There appear to be three main answers 
First the animal may need bright colours for social reasons to attract a mate repel a rival maintain high status or carry out parental duties  Second it may need to make itself distinct from other species with which it shares its living space 
If that space is a particularly rich environment such as a coral reef and food of many kinds is plentiful many different species will be able to live there together providing they can tell one another apart instantly  Bright colours and complex patterns help to make this possible 
Third an animal may be brightly coloured as a warning to its enemies that it is not to be trifled with  Any species with a secret weapon an obnoxious smell foul-tasting flesh poison glands a painful sting or a venomous bite can advertise the fact by wearing conspicuous warning coloration 
Patterns of colours used in this way are called aposematic the root words apo sema meaning literally away-signal  The vivid markings and bright colours of these caterpillars above act as warning signals telling predators that the potential victims are unpalatable to be avoided at all costs 
The more striking the colours the easier they are to remember no predator is likely to forget these particular insects  The markings of this sea slug below operate in the same way 
We know that these go away signals work because time and again predators have been observed to avoid attacking brightly coloured species  When monkeys were offered hundreds of different kinds of insects many brightly coloured and many others with dull patterns and colours only one in five of the bright ones were eaten while three out of four of the dull ones were eagerly gobbled up 
The monkeys were cautious when confronted with conspicuous markings  They may have acquired this caution by observational learning watching other monkeys trying to eat these insects and seeing the way they reacted to the prey 's chemical warfare or they may have evolved an inborn reaction towards bright patterns enabling them to avoid such species from birth without any learning process or they may have learned caution the hard way by personal experience 
Personal experience if it happened would have left them with a deeply embedded memory of an acutely unpleasant incident  If as naÃ¯ve young hunters they attacked a brightly coloured prey bit it and started to chew it only to discover that it had a foul taste or a poisonous secretion they would probably remember it for the rest of their lives 
Frequently one-trial learning as it is called is all that is necessary  Any human being who has eaten a bad oyster spent a night in agony and vowed never to touch oysters again will understand this 
The poisonous skin of these salamanders opposite protects them from predation their bright warning colours help by alerting would-be killers before any damaging bite has been inflicted  For all its speed the hunter 's learning process is not particularly pleasant for the prey animal providing the education 
At best it will be severely prodded and nipped  More likely it will be mauled and mangled 
And in all possibility it will never recover  This is one of the weaknesses of the system 
Warning colours work well with educated predators but do involve repeated sacrifices as young hunters learn their trade  Nevertheless taken on balance if you possess unpleasant chemical properties it pays to advertise 
Once the learning has taken place the predators leave you alone and you can go about your business in a quietly relaxed manner without too much fleeing hiding panic or scuttling for cover  In fact the pace of your life will be slower and your lifespan may even be extended 
Animals with warning colours on average live longer than those without and there is a simple reason for this  Once they have completed their reproductive life they can live on past it as trainers for novice predators 
If they are fatally damaged when attacked their deaths do not affect the population as a whole because they have already bred and are no longer doing so  They therefore take some of the strain off the younger breeding stock within their species 
If dull cryptic animals live on after their reproductive phase is over they by contrast only serve to increase the population density of their kind and thereby increase the chances of a predator finding them despite their camouflage  Once the killer has stumbled upon one cryptic individual it quickly develops a searching image and then finds others more easily 
So it pays for cryptic species to die soon after their breeding period is over  One disadvantage of warning colours is that they may attract killers who might have missed the prey animals altogether if they had not been so gaudy 
A refinement that overcomes this is a coloration that appears inconspicuous at a distance but extremely bright and vivid near by an improvement found in certain caterpillars and moths for example  An alternative is a special posture that the prey adopts when approached by the predator suddenly showing off its warning colours 
The normal posture hides these bright colours the display reveals them at close quarters  Many amphibians employ this device 
The Oriental fire-bellied toad right keeps its bright colours on its underside  They remain hidden until it is threatened when it displays them by turning itself upside-down 
This katydid opposite a kind of grasshopper stands on its head to display its own version of a warning display  Other weaknesses of the system are that stupid killers do not learn quickly enough if at all 
Predators from the lower ranks of the animal kingdom sometimes seem to be incapable of inhibiting their automatic responses to the brightly coloured individuals they encounter  With each attack it is as if they are meeting the distasteful animal tor the first time 
This means that for certain prey being conspicuous is a constant risk and not one worth taking  Only wise predators can be broken in 
Also any killers wise or stupid can be driven to eat anything when hungry enough  Starvation overcomes all and the brightly coloured succumb along with the cryptic 
Finally there are a few killers that have been able to develop a special tolerance for certain poisons enabling them to eat the noxious prey without ill-effects  Clearly though despite these few shortcomings the warning display is a useful one 
It is found over a wide range of species from butterflies and wasps to sea snakes and skunks  The yellow and black banding of bees and wasps is easily remembered and avoided 
The black and white stripes of the skunks act as a powerful deterrent even from a great distance  Warning colours are found among caterpillars and butterflies ladybirds and ground beetles frogs and salamanders and many other animal groups 
From close scrutiny it soon emerges that they all have several features in common  To start with nearly all the warning patterns consist of pale bands or light patches against black backgrounds 
The pale colour is usually white or yellow or orange and shows up vividly against the dark areas  This is not arbitrary it is designed so that it operates just as well with colour-blind predators as with those that have good colour vision 
Another strange quality of warning coloration is that it varies remarkably little from one species to the next  Even quite distinct groups share the same sorts of patterns 
Again this is no accident and it has a special advantage  For example if there are several quite unrelated species of unpalatable butterflies living in one particular region and one of them has evolved a warning pattern of black yellow and red markings it will pay the others to follow suit because they will then all share the training risks associated with novice predators 
Once a young killer has attacked one individual with this wing pattern it will not only avoid other members of that species but also members of other species that look superficially like it  These warning clubs were discovered by a German field-worker called Fritz MÃ¼ller 
It was as if each species of inedible butterfly was mimicked by the others and this convergence of colour pattern became known as MÃ¼llerian Mimicry  If harmful insects can protect themselves from attack by displaying special markings that warn away predators then it follows that harmless insects can benefit by mimicking them 
Here a stinging wasp above left is imitated by a harmless hoverfly above right a distasteful butterfly opposite left top has a harmless copy opposite left bottom both are from Nigeria and a venomous coral snake opposite right top has a harmless mimic opposite right bottom with almost identical markings  This is called Batesian Mimicry after its discoverer Henry Bates 
Another form of mimicry was discovered by the English naturalist Henry Bates  Also a field observer of insects he noticed that many edible butterflies had the same bright markings as inedible ones 
He saw that these tasty species were treated with respect by predators as if they too were distasteful to eat  In other words they were sheep in wolf 's clothing 
They were the harmless copying the harmful and benefiting from the deception  This type of warning signal is today known as Batesian Mimicry 
It only works well of course if there are sufficient numbers of the genuinely distasteful individuals around to keep the predators well trained  If the mimics swamp out their models the trick no longer succeeds 
Studies with starlings as predators showed that the mimic insects could not rise above the 60 per cent level without rapidly losing protection  But as long as 40 per cent or more of the brightly coloured insects were genuinely distasteful the mimicry was highly efficient 
Where the prey are merely distasteful or unpalatable the predators can learn their lesson safely  They may suffer sickness vomiting or acute pain but they do not die 
They live on now fully educated and fill the environment with cautious killers  But what if the prey is itself a killer 
What if its poison is lethal  In such cases each novice predator that makes a mistake becomes a corpse and learns nothing 
Both the prey and the predators keep on suffering  In such cases it is essential for the predators to evolve inborn reactions to the warning signals of the lethal prey so that they can be avoided without any learning process taking place 
One example of this concerns the deadly sea snake and a variety of predatory fish  The brightly marked sea snakes are among the most venomous snakes to be found anywhere in the world 
They are confined to the warm waters of the Indo-Pacific region but are absent altogether from the Atlantic Ocean  In a series of tests it was discovered that large predatory fish from the Pacific avoided sea snakes when they were offered as food but that fish from the Atlantic lacked this caution and attacked them 
Ten species of Pacific fish were used and nine from the Atlantic  It is highly unlikely that any of the Pacific fish used in these tests had ever encountered a sea snake previously and in two instances they certainly could not have done so 
It appears that in this case at least the avoidance of the deadly prey is inborn  Doubtless other such cases also exist 
THE HORRORS OF chemical warfare are not confined to the laboratories of military scientists  The natural world is full of them 
We all know of the dramatic effects of the venoms of snakes and spiders the savage stings of wasps and jellyfish and the virulent poisons of scorpions and stingrays but there are many other examples in the animal kingdom and some of them are even more lethal  The champion poisoners the Borgias of the forest are the tiny kokoi frogs that patter boldly about in the tropical undergrowth of South America 
These beautifully coloured amphibians usually less than 2 inches long carry in their skin-glands a poison so powerful that it is hard to describe its strength  If you collected as little as I gram of this toxin it would be enough to kill a hundred thousand average-sized men 
If you gathered I ounce of it you could wipe out more than two and a half million people  It is the most potent poison known to us from the entire animal world 
These lethal little amphibians belong to a family that has been given the name of poison-arrow frogs  This is because long before white men arrived on the scene the local Indians living deep in the Amazonian rain forests caught and killed these animals to provide themselves with the poison tips for their arrows 
Impaled on a stick and held over a fire the dying frogs exuded a milky secretion  The arrows were held in this liquid and then allowed to dry 
One frog was used to coat fifty arrowheads  When the Indians went hunting whether for animals or for rival Indians their firepower was deadly 
Anything struck by a poisoned arrow was paralysed almost immediately and in a few moments was dead  The most virulent poison known from the animal world comes from the skin of the small brightly coloured poison-arrow frogs from South American forests opposite and below 
Because of their lethal defence system these small frogs are able to live bold untroubled lives on the forest floor hopping about conspicuously with bright colours advertising their presence  Many other animals that harbour secret chemical defences also show themselves fearlessly to the world and some of them also perform special displays that indicate their readiness to engage in a chemical encounter 
Anyone who has encountered a skunk will know that before it fires its stinking spray it issues clear warnings of its intentions  It starts by stamping its feet on the ground and arching its back 
If this combined with its vivid display of black and white fur does not deter the enemy it may then start swaying its body back and forth as if cranking itself up for action  At this point it may especially if it is a spotted skunk perform a handstand rearing on to its front legs with its hind legs held high in the air 
This amazing posture displays its markings even more conspicuously and in this position it may advance several feet towards the attacker  In origin this inverted posture seems to be related to the scent-marking action of certain small carnivores that deposit their odours upwards on high objects 
Some mongooses for example employ a similar handstand when marking overhanging branches with their personal scent and South American bush dogs regularly stand on their front feet when leaving their personal odours on tree-trunks  Presumably it is because of the link between standing up in this way and the act of squeezing scent from the anal region that the posture has become associated with the firing of the anal glands by the defensive skunk 
The message of the stance is clear enough come any closer and I will squeeze my glands tight  However before actually firing its spray the skunk must revert to a position in which all four feet are on the ground the tail is raised and the back fully arched 
Then looking back over its shoulder at the enemy behind it it aims and shoots  As it does so it swings its body slightly from side to side like a machine-gunner raking the enemy ranks 
This gives its nauseating pungent spray a wider range an arc of about 45 degrees and greatly increases the defender 's chances of covering its target  Any animal that has been sprayed just once will respond immediately and back away fast from a displaying skunk 
And with good reason  The spray is not merely unpleasant but is also extremely painful if it reaches its target directly 
The noxious substance contained in the two anal glands one on either side of the animal 's rectum is called butyl mercaptan and it plays havoc with a predator 's face  In addition to the foul stench it produces it is also damaging to sensitive mucous membranes 
If it gets into the predator 's nose it can injure the tissues there and if it enters the mouth it causes violent vomiting  If the spray hits the eyes there is almost unbearable pain and temporary blindness 
It is pitiful to see the agony of a naÃ¯ve dog that has nosed up too close to a skunk and been sprayed in the face  Retching vomiting and desperately trying to rub its face clean the animal learns a lesson it never forgets 
The stench of the skunk seems to last for ever  The amber-coloured fluid is ejected with great force a distance of between 8 and 10 feet 
And the odour can be carried as much as a mile away if the wind is blowing in that direction  Gloves used to handle a defensive skunk still stink of the animal 's scent more than a year after contact 
If the skunk has not squirted its glands for some time then it is primed for about six powerful shots at the enemy but it is unlikely to use all its ammunition at once because it will take about a week for replenishment and the animal can not afford to risk being cornered empty-glanded by a second predator  So it uses its chemical defence sparingly 
Even so it is powerful enough to keep almost any enemy at bay  There are nine species of skunks with a combined range that covers nearly all of North Central and South America 
Their equivalent in Africa is the zorilla but its chemical impact is not quite so impressive  Several other small carnivores also emit unpleasant stenches when caught by predators and sometimes these odours may deter their attackers 
Some foxes mongooses and weasels are capable of this type of defence and doubtless give the hungry predators the sensation that perhaps after all the food object they are pursuing is not so tasty  In all these cases the unpleasant chemicals employed are modifications of personal scent secretions but another major source of chemical defence substances is the saliva 
The only mammals with a venomous bite are certain moles and shrews  They employ their poisonous saliva primarily as a weapon against their prey 
When a venomous mole or shrew bites its prey its saliva acts as a paralytic agent  In this way it is able if it wishes to make large stores of food 
One mole-nest was found with an adjoining store of no fewer than 1 280 worms  The poisonous saliva can be used in a secondary way to deter attackers 
In some species the venom is remarkably strong  One American short-tailed shrew stores enough venom to kill two hundred mice 
The only other type of mammal to employ chemical warfare is the duck-billed platypus  On the backs of the ankles of the male platypus there are horny spurs 
These are hollow and are connected to poison glands further up the legs  Normally covered by a fold of skin these spurs can be erected if the animal is caught and with a sudden jab of the hind legs the sharp points of spurs are stabbed into the attacker 's flesh 
The poison injected is enough to kill any dog-sized animal and even fully-grown humans are at risk suffering intense pain  The mystery with the platypus venom is why it evolved 
The species does not seem to have any appropriate indigenous enemies against which to use it  As it occurs only in the males it has been suggested that it is somehow employed in male-to-male rivalry 
Alternatively it could have developed as another example of a prey-killing poison that has been secondarily used against attackers  Certainly when the dingoes and their human companions first arrived in Australia the poison-spurs of the platypus found a valuable use as defensive weapons against the new invaders 
The skunk is capable of ejecting a spray of foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands but it always gives fair warning before attacking in this way  The male of the duck-billed platypus has sharp poison-spurs on its hind legs 
The most notorious poisoners of the animal world are certainly the snakes  Their fame in this regard has been their undoing and has caused the needless persecution and destruction of countless millions of harmless reptiles 
Because some snakes are genuinely dangerous to man all snakes are feared and yet only 15 per cent of the living species are in fact venomous  There are 2,300 harmless species of snakes and only 400 poisonous ones but few people take the trouble to find out which is which 
If a snake is encountered no one takes any chances  One simple way of spotting a poisonous species is to look at the shape of the head 
If it is unusually wide it is almost certainly a highly venomous form  This is because the poison is stored in greatly enlarged and modified salivary glands 
These glands are connected to long pointed hollow teeth that act as hypodermic needles injecting the lethal liquid into the victim 's flesh  In the most advanced types these fangs are hinged 
When the snake 's mouth is shut they lie flat but when the jaws are opened wide to strike the two upper teeth that supply the venom are pivoted down through about go degrees so that they are at right angles to the top of the head  This means that when the jaws gape fully open the sharp fangs are aimed directly forward 
At this moment the snake strikes flinging its neck towards its victim at the astonishing speed of 8 feet per second  The actual distance covered will probably be no more than 2 feet so it is necessary to respond in less than a quarter of a second in order to avoid being struck 
Some moles and shrews carry chemical weapons  This short-tailed shrew can inflict an unpleasant bite with the help of spittle from its venomous salivary glands 
As the teeth sink into the flesh the pressure of this action squeezes venom out of the glands and down the hollow tubes of the paired fangs  It spreads quickly once inside the victim and is soon being circulated in the bloodstream 
For human victims the classic he-man response to this injury is the cut-and-suck treatment in which the unfortunate sufferer undergoes further trauma by having the site of the venom injection sliced open with a sharp knife and the blood sucked from the now gaping wound  All this achieves in reality is increased shock and the greater chance of a stress death 
It does nothing to reduce the damage because by the time the sucking has taken place the poison is already busily circulating through the victim 's body  The best hope is to keep the patient quiet and inject the appropriate anti-venin 
Unfortunately it is crucial to know which species of snake is involved because snake poisons are so complex that it has proved impossible to develop a multi-venin' that will treat all forms of snakebite  The bite of each species must be treated with the anti-venin specific to that kind of snake 
A mistake with the treatment will simply mean a double threat to the life of the patient  So the typical snakebite victim is stabbed rather than bitten 
There is no grabbing but merely hitting with an open mouth  The reason for this is that the snake must do its best to protect its precious fangs 
If it bit its victim and then hung on tight the ensuing struggle while the injected individual died would probably damage the long delicate teeth ripping them from their sockets  So the snake makes its deft rapid lunge and then immediately withdraws to await results 
The poison works so quickly that the victim rapidly succumbs and the snake is then safe to make its move  The primary function of snake venom is of course to quieten prey before swallowing them 
Its use in self-defence is entirely secondary and only employed as a last resort  All snakes prefer to retreat from predators as quickly as possible but if cornered will then use their lightning strike as a form of protection 
If the victim is not edible the reptile quickly slithers away into hiding but if it is a suitable prey it simply sits back and waits for the animal 's agonies to cease  Then as it lies dying the snake moves in and starts to swallow the now helpless creature 
In this way the fangs receive the minimum of damage  Even so they do sometimes become dislodged by the ferocity of the strike 
When this happens a new fang quickly grows to replace the lost one  At any moment there are about six fangs in reserve on each side of the mouth at various stages of development 
When an active fang is ripped out the next most mature one takes its place and quickly develops so that it is ready to fire  The most impressive of all fangs are those of the gaboon viper from Africa 
Many of the big vipers possess fangs that are about an inch long but the gaboon 's huge teeth are nearly 2 inches in length penetrating well into the deeper tissues where there is a rich supply of blood vessels to carry the poison away  The poison itself is a yellowish cloudy liquid 
It contains neurotoxins nerve-poisons and haemotoxins blood-poisons  In the venom of cobras mambas and sea-snakes the nerve-poisons are dominant in vipers and rattlesnakes the blood-poisons are more active 
With a cobra bite there is a creeping paralysis accompanied by nausea and vomiting leading to convulsions and the cessation of breathing  With a rattlesnake bite there is massive swelling around the bitten part with the flesh turning blue green purple or black with livid blotches and blisters and this gradually spreads throughout most of the body affecting the heart and eventually stopping its action 
The body of the adult human however can often withstand this chemical onslaught and ultimately recover fully  It is large enough to absorb the damage in a way that the smaller prey species can not manage 
It has been estimated that of the thousand people bitten by rattlesnakes annually in the United States only about thirty die  This puts the chances of survival at about 33 to 1 and some authorities think this should be even higher as much as 50 to 1 
Opposite Venomous snakes do not bite their victims they stab them with open mouths injecting their venom through hollow teeth in the upper jaw  The fangs of this pygmy rattlesnake are clearly visible but are not yet in the full striking position 
which would entail a much wider gaping of the jaws to point the tips of the fangs directly forward  It is difficult to obtain accurate figures from the wilder more snake-ridden parts of the world such as Africa Asia and South America but an attempt at a global survey carried out in the 1950s gave a total world figure of thirty thousand deaths annually from all forms of snakebite 
The spitting cobras of Africa are capable of shooting their venom at an enemy from a distance of 6 feet causing eye damage and severe pain  Perhaps the most remarkable of all serpentine chemical defences is that employed by the spitting cobras of Africa 
These snakes have evolved the ability to rear up and squeeze their poison glands so forcibly that the venom inside them is propelled towards their enemy as a jet or spray of droplets  They are capable of aiming accurately enough to splash a man 's face from a distance of 6 feet 
If the venom strikes his eyes it can temporarily blind him and possibly even permanently damage his sight  The pain is severe and no predator would risk a second close encounter with these snakes 
The toad possesses a dangerous poison in its large warts  When the toad is attacked this chemical weapon oozes out as a thick creamy liquid 
Any mammal biting the slow-moving toad is soon retching and vomiting  Dogs are particularly vulnerable to this poison but some snakes appear to be immune 
Unlike snakes lizards have not specialised in chemical warfare  Of the three thousand living species only two possess venom 
They are the gila monster and the beaded lizard from Mexico and the southern states of the USA  Their poison has the same origin as that of the snakes modified saliva but the animals are much more primitive in their wounding mechanism 
There is no hypodermic injection  A lizard simply holds tight with its teeth 
The venom trickles into the enemy 's damaged flesh as the lizard slobbers and struggles to keep its grip  Like a bulldog it refuses to let go even when savagely attacked by the desperate victim 
But it would be wrong to give the impression that these are aggressive animals  They avoid trouble at all times and only if they are cornered or pestered will they bite at their attackers 
Their neurotoxin produces effects similar to those seen in snakebite victims although the number of deaths from lizard-bites is extremely small  Indeed only eight cases have been fully authenticated 
There are only two kinds of poisonous lizards the gila monster seen here and the similar but larger beaded lizard  Both bite their attackers and hang on like bulldogs letting the venom trickle into the wound as they do so 
Among the amphibians there are many with poisonous skins but none that has a poisonous bite  If you are to suffer from amphibian poisoning it is you who must do the biting 
The deadly little poison-arrow frogs have already been mentioned but there are many other frogs and toads whose skin glands and mucous secretions can cause vomiting and nausea in predators that grab hold of them in their jaws  Almost all these poisons are derived from the various substances that have evolved as lubricants for the soft vulnerable skins of these small animals 
Where the mucous has become distasteful the animals bearing it have prospered and in this way increasingly distasteful and eventually highly poisonous secretions have been favoured by natural selection  The most common circumstance in which human swimmers are poisoned by fish is when a well camouflaged stingray is trodden on 
It reacts automatically by lashing upwards with its long thin tail and stabbing the victim 's leg or foot with the sharp spine near its tip  This spine has a serrated edge and can inflict painful wounds 
The world of fish is full of needle-sharp spines that can inject agonising poisons into unwary flesh  The greatest threat to humans comes from the stingrays large flatfish that lie inconspicuously on the seabed in shallow waters 
If a human foot accidentally treads on one of these shy unaggressive animals it responds instantly with an upward flick of its long thin tail  Towards the tip of this tail there is a sharp spine with a serrated edge and this is slashed painfully against the offending foot or leg 
All along the underside of this spine there are little grooves lined with a spongy venomous tissue  The tissue contains soluble proteins that cause intense pain and swelling but which are rarely lethal to man 
Out of a thousand cases reported in United States waters over a five-year period only two resulted in death  At first sight the cone shell does not appear to be particularly dangerous but it carries a secret weapon that can cause an unusually painful death 
When attacking it protrudes its long snout and as it pushes it against the flesh of its enemy it fires a small venom-carrying harpoon a hollow dart formed from a tooth that can kill a human being within a few hours  More deadly and much more painful is the chemical weaponry of the heavily camouflaged and lethargic stonefish 
For a human swimmer to step on one of these almost invisible bottom-dwellers is to experience perhaps the worst possible pain  Even the most fiendish human torturer has fallen far short of the agony provided by this small shallow-water fish 
Its only response to being disturbed is to erect its dorsal spines  It makes no attempt to move away even if the water near by is being violently disturbed 
The venom is held in small sacs near the tips of the spines so that when the human foot descends on the fish the poison is squeezed into the wound by the downward pressure  The fish does nothing the victim impales himself 
And the ensuing pain is so intense that victims seem for a while to go out of their minds  They rush from the water fling themselves down on the beach and proceed to roll around in agony screaming and frothing at the mouth 
Helpers approaching have sometimes been bitten or attacked wildly in the delirium that follows and which may last as long as twelve tormented hours  Morphine has no effect 
Raving and thrashing about the victim becomes gradually weaker and if lucky may eventually become unconscious  The injured limb swells up until it looks like the leg of an elephant 
The toes or fingers nearest the wound turn black and later drop off  Death is not uncommon but an anti-venin has now been produced and is effective if it can be used in time 
The stonefish is the most deadly of all fishes but many others possess poisonous spines developed from fin-rays and any prickly-looking fish should be treated with great respect  Other examples include the scorpion fish lion fish rabbitfish toad fish waspfish frogfish and many of the catfish 
Some like the stonefish are inconspicuous while others flaunt their chemical power by sailing around in bright colours that dare you to touch them  The beautiful lion fish belongs to this gaudy category and is therefore much easier to avoid 
All these spikes evolved originally as a way of preventing predation by larger fish  Today with powerful venoms added they have become a formidable defence system against anything that enters the domain of the spiny fish 
Also infesting this domain are the dramatically spiny sea urchins  Some species possess poison bags near the tips of the long brittle spines 
When trodden on these spines puncture flesh and usually break off inside the resulting wounds ensuring the prolonged insertion of the painful poisons  Many fish are poisonous including the turkey fish above but the most dangerous of all is the heavily camouflaged stonefish above right 
Its thirteen powerful dorsal spines contain enough poison to kill any human swimmer who accidentally treads on it with a bare foot  Surprisingly certain sea snails are also quite deadly 
The seemingly harmless cone shells attractively patterned and very slow-moving can kill with their sting and human medicine has to date found no antidote  A harpoon-shaped tooth is thrust into the flesh of the victim carrying the venom with it 
Numbness paralysis and eventually heart failure result  But the only way one of these snails will attack is if its soft parts are manhandled 
Holding it by the hard shell is safe enough although a steady grip is recommended  Among poisonous jellyfish and their relatives the Portuguese man-o'-war opposite is notorious as a killer but despite its reputation there is no authenticated record of it having caused a human death 
The less impressive-looking jellyfish called the sea wasp or box jelly below on the other hand is one of the most venomous animals in the world capable of causing human death in less than 10 minutes  More difficult to avoid are the poisonous jellyfish 
As they float through the water their long almost invisible tentacles hang down and spread out far from the visible central part of the body  In some species these trailing threads full of stinging-cells called nematocysts can reach as far as 50 feet 
Swimming through a jellyfish-infested sea is like advancing through a minefield  Each stinging-cell contains a coiled-up tube 
If a victim brushes up against a tentacle literally thousands of these tiny cells automatically fire shooting out the sharp-tipped tubes like minute harpoons  These penetrate the skin and paralyse the intruder 
If the victim is a small fish paralysis and death are rapid and it can then be drawn in and eaten  But if the body struck by the stinging-cells is large such as a human swimmer 's the poison is usually insufficient to kill 
Instead there is searing pain blistering of the skin and a rapidly discovered aversion to swimming in the sea  The most virulent of all jellyfish is not as is usually claimed the large Portuguese man-o'-war but the sea wasp or box jelly commonly found off the shores of Australia 
The neurotoxins contained in its thousands of little venomous darts are strong enough to cause both extreme pain and sometimes even death  Since it stings anything it bumps into regardless of what that may be the only solution is to stay clear of the water when the swarms of jellyfish appear 
Staying clear of water is no protection against the hundreds of poisonous insects spiders and scorpions that abound on dry land  Some sting some bite some throw poisonous hairs at you and others squirt you with blinding sprays 
Most are unpleasant but not lethal  A few are deadly 
The most dangerous of all the spiders is the black widow a small species that is common throughout America and which responds to vibrations of its web by rushing out and biting what it considers to be its next meal  Its bite is rarely lethal but is so painful that some victims have survived when they hoped not to 
A meticulous survey of black widow attacks on humans in the USA from 1726 to 1943 revealed 1,291 recorded bites in other words an average of no more than six bites a year  Only 55 caused the death of the victim or one every four years 
Despite its bad reputation  it is clearly not a species to cause concern 
Even less of a threat is the huge tarantula or bird-eating spider  This has the worst reputation of any creepy-crawly in the public imagination and yet its bite which is extremely rare is no worse than a bee sting 
Its usual reaction when abused by an attacker is to tear out its own hair rather than attempt to bite  It flings its fine hairs in the face of the assailant in a dense cloud 
When this cloud settles on the skin it causes a red rash but it is no more than an irritation and certainly nothing to justify the terrible image of this animal that has been so relentlessly fostered by cheap novels and films  As with so many poisonous animals the tarantula prefers to keep its venom for feeding time and only employs it against enemies as a last resort 
It is in fact impossible to find any poisonous animal that actively goes in search of victims unless it is feeding  Despite popular mythology concerning evil and vicious species that track down their victims ruthlessly and mercilessly the reality is that no venom no poison no bite no sting is ever administered except under extreme provocation or simply by accident unless the victim is either a potential prey or a rival belonging to the same species 
As in human warfare chemical defences are essentially deterrents rather than everyday weapons  The black widow spider is the most dangerous of all spider species and its venomous bite has been known to cause human deaths on rare occasions 
But it has been calculated that there is only a 4 per cent chance of dying if bitten by one of them  DEFLECTION DISPLAYS are deceptive 
They are examples of natural deceit  Just as the magician fools his audience with his sleight of hand so deflection displays confuse the pouncing predator by sending him false signals 
Their essential feature is that they misdirect the enemy 's attack so that it fails to damage any vital organs  Most predators prefer to attack their prey at the head end 
When zooming in for the kill or performing a lightning strike they ignore the tail end of the body and aim straight for the eyes  This targets them towards the most important part of the prey where they can do most damage with their first contact 
Even if the prey is not killed outright there is a greater chance that it will be incapacitated  Many a prey species can afford to dispense with its tail but can never afford to lose its head 
Also most prey can only flee fast in a forward direction so attacking the head is the best way of hampering their escape  And many predators like to grasp the prey by the head to facilitate swallowing 
In the case of fish prickly fins and sharp gill-covers all point backwards  Gulping such a prey animal down head-first is a smooth operation 
Swallowing it backwards can be painful or even fatal  For these reasons some prey species possess display markings that confuse their heads and tails 
They make their heads less head-like and wear false eyes on their tails  The predator no longer knows where to strike 
There are several degrees of deception  The simplest involves displaying a large eye-spot marking somewhere at the rear end of the body 
This looks as eye-like to the predator as the real eye and gives the prey a fifty-fifty chance of losing its head  Usually the false eye is a little bigger than the real one tipping the odds slightly in favour of the prey 
A predator dashing in for the kill has no time to assess the minute details of the eyes to detect whether they are real or false  It simply sees eye and reads head 
A more advanced technique involves camouflaging the real eye while at the same time making the false eye truly spectacular with a huge black pupil surrounded by a bright white eye-ring  This tips the balance much more in favour of the prey and sends most attackers lurching towards the wrong end of the body 
Even if part of the tail is lost the victim survives and swims away to safety  A large eye-spot at the tail of a fish deflects the interest of a predator away from the more vulnerable head 
Having an eye at each end of its body this Oscar cichlid gives its predators only a fifty-fifty chance of striking its head  An even greater refinement is possible 
Two species of butterfly fish have been observed to swim slowly backwards at the first hint of trouble making their false eyes seem even more real  Then when the predator moves in for the kill at the very last moment the butterfly fish switch direction and dash rapidly forward leaving the frustrated would-be killers snapping at empty water 
On this butterfly fish the eye-spot at the rear of the body becomes the centre of attention the real eye being obscured by a vertical stripe  Deflection eye-spots are found in a wide variety of quite unrelated species 
They seem to have evolved not once but many times  As a result they show subtle differences some being positioned on the upper fin some on the rear of the main trunk and some on the tail-stem 
The elimination of the real eye is also achieved in various ways  Sometimes there is a single vertical bar running right through it to obscure it 
Sometimes the whole body of the fish is banded with vertical marks one of which conveniently blots out the real eye  In other cases the eye-concealing lines are horizontal stripes or a single diagonal line may run up through the eye and end on top of the head 
Occasionally the real eye is hidden in a mass of spots sometimes white and sometimes black  In one unique fish the imperial angelfish the juveniles are covered in white lines that curve round in a special pattern that centres all one 's attention on the tail end 
There is no actual eye-spot but the effect is just as compelling with the curved lines shrinking to smaller and smaller circles as they approach the tail  The head by contrast is obliterated by formless meandering lines 
Some fish go a step further and display not one but a pair of false eyes  This is even more confusing because the predator receives the impression that it is approaching a fish that is swimming straight towards it 
These false eyes stare implacably challenging the predator to bite while the small real eye of the prey is sufficiently concealed not to give the game away  This sharp-nosed puffer fish left has a real eye on the right that is not inconspicuous 
Despite this however one 's gaze is drawn to the huge black false eye at the other end of the body  Fish are not alone in staging this deception 
Reptiles and insects employ similar tactics but in their case eye-spots are not necessary to deflect the interest of their predators  All they need is a patch of bright colour on their tails 
Among the lizards this can be seen in young skinks of several species  Their heads are inconspicuous and camouflaged with black and white stripes that conceal the eyes 
These stripes run right down the body but peter out near the base of the tail  The rest of the tail is bright vivid blue so intense that it is hard to see anything else in its vicinity including the head and body of the small reptile 
When approached by a stalking killer the lizard 's tail is the focus of attention  If the predator pounces and manages to catch hold of the tail it quickly breaks away from the reptile 's body and even in its severed condition continues to writhe and twist either on the ground or in the mouth of the triumphant killer 
While the lizard scuttles away to safety the predator is left to discover little by little that its apparently succulent meal is in reality no more than a scaly scrag-end  The comet opposite top is a fish that attempts to lose its real eye in a sea of white dots 
These dots do not however conceal the huge eye-spot at the rear end of the body  The vivid markings of the emperor angelfish opposite bottom create a strong circular motif just in front of the tail 
There is no such focus of interest at the head end  Again a predator 's attention is deflected away from the vital head organs 
Most skinks lose this blue colouring as they become adult  Their speed of escape reaction is by then greater and they have become much more experienced 
On balance they are better off being fully camouflaged at this stage because although the blue tail may save the life of many a young lizard it also has the disadvantage of being so conspicuous that it can to some extent attract unwanted attention in the first place  In some species that are heavily preyed upon such as the Polynesian blue-tailed skink the tail colour is unusually retained right through into adulthood 
The balance there continues to favour a small tail-end sacrifice even with experienced individuals  Some snakes go a little further 
When approached by a possible killer they hide their real heads and raise up the tips of their tails  These they waggle boldly in the air 
In the Malayan pipe snake the tip of the tail is bright red and the sight of this little patch of colour moving about so invitingly is too much for most predators to resist  They attack the tail and ignore the vital head end of the snake 
Unlike the blue-tailed lizards these snakes only have the bright colour on the underside of the tail-tip  This is an improved model because when the snake is crawling along with its tail on the ground the red colour is concealed 
It only becomes conspicuous after an attack has started and never provokes that attack  Insects adopt two different devices 
Some butterflies have a rear end that looks more like a head than their real heads  The trailing wing-tips have conspicuous head markings and even develop long fake antennae while the actual head is inconspicuous 
Even more convincing heads are found on some lantern flies where the real head is well hidden and the false head has a huge eye-spot and bold antennae  These insects complete their deception by jumping backwards when attacked 
The other method used by certain butterflies is similar to that found in the deflection-displaying fish  Paired eye-spots on the rear wing-tips give the impression of faces watching 
Specimens of these butterflies are often found with bite-marks in the region of these false eyes showing that bird predators really are attracted to this part of the body allowing the insects to fly off to safety with no more damage than a few frayed edges  This type of butterfly eye-spot should not be confused with the much larger eyes that occur on some species eye-spots that are suddenly flashed at the enemy as it draws close 
These do not function as deflection devices but as startle displays  Rather than misdirecting attacks they repel them altogether as we shall see in the next chapter 
Some lizards and snakes possess a dull-coloured body combined with a brightly coloured tail  When approached by a predator the tail attracts all the attention and is more likely to be attacked the vulnerable head is thus spared damage 
In the western skink below the tail is bright blue in the ring-necked snake right it is orange  This owl butterfly opposite uses a different deflection device having a pair of small eye-spots near the trailing edge of its wings 
If a bird pecks at these it will probably only make a small tear in the edge of the wing and the butterfly may then escape  Some butterflies and moths have evolved false heads at the rear ends of their bodies deflecting the attacks of birds away from their vital organs 
This hairstreak butterfly has achieved the effect by evolving not only a coloured false head but also a radiating black and white pattern on its wings that directs the observer 's eye away from the real head  IF AN ANIMAL is approached by a killer it may try to defend itself by giving its attacker a fright 
If it can startle the predator in some way there is a faint chance that the enemy may panic and flee  At the very least the assailant may be made to pause for a moment before attacking and this may be just enough to allow the prey to escape 
Buying time whether a lot or a little during an attack is always worth doing  Many animals attempt this and there are two popular devices sudden sounds and suddenly displayed fright-patterns 
It is the suddenness that is vital  Nothing gradual can startle anything 
As directors of horror movies know so well there is no better way to scare their audience than to have some unidentified object flash suddenly on to the screen very close to the hero 's face  As the strange shape darts in the whole audience jumps and gasps 
It is a deep-seated defensive mechanism that we share with most higher forms of life  Firing a gun behind an unsuspecting head has the same effect 
The body tenses the neck hunches and the eyes close protectively  It is during such a split second that a prey animal may be able to make its escape if it is fast enough 
If it is a slow-moving species then it must rely instead on provoking a panic response in the attacker a response that sees it pull back in horror and retreat to a safe place  The spit and hiss of a cornered cat may startle an attacker because of its suddenness and also because it is reminiscent of the threat display of a venomous snake 
Some mammals especially those that hide in dark dens or crevices respond to the approach of a predator with an explosive spit and hiss  The suddenness of the spit makes the attacker jump smartly backwards and the hiss that follows alarms it even more it retreats carefully watching the dark corner from where the noise is originating 
It is not hard to guess why this sudden display is so effective  Venomous snakes spit and hiss when they are cornered and no predator likes to risk the possibility that a lurking shape may possess poisonous fangs 
The sudden unexpected appearance of the bright blue tongue of this skink may startle an approaching predator sufficiently to make it think twice about attacking  This snake-mimicry is employed by many species from the familiar domestic cat to less familiar finches 
A cat cornered by say a dog will produce an explosive spit that always makes the approaching animal jump back in alarm  As it hisses in its fake-snake manner following the spit it completes the illusion by thrashing its tail about in a serpentine way 
In the semi-darkness it is a brave predator that ignores this bluff display  Some small cavity-nesting birds rather surprisingly employ similar tactics 
A little African finch the cut-throat finch when it is disturbed while sitting inside its ball-shape nest gives a bizarre snake-dance reaction  Anyone who has peered too closely into a cut-throat finch 's nest when the bird is sitting on eggs will have experienced the disturbing feeling that very suddenly their eye is far too close to a snake for comfort 
Instead of fleeing like most small birds approached this closely the cut-throat sits firm and hisses like a snake  It then adds a remarkable visual display writhing its body in a sinuous undulating movement exactly like a crawling snake 
Even human beings find this distressing to encounter at close quarters without any warning and find themselves drawing back  Our fear of snakes is as deep-seated as our fear of sudden movements 
And the same is true of many other predators  In fact it is difficult to understand why more nesting birds do not use this defence 
Visual displays that involve the sudden appearance of bright colour patches or conspicuous patterns especially eye-spots also intimidate approaching killers  Because poisonous animals are often brightly coloured as a warning to would-be predators there is a startle value in a prey species suddenly flashing a bright patch of colour even if it is not poisonous 
This is not simple mimicry which would only entail being the same bright colour as a distasteful species  It is a combination of mimicry and sudden exposure 
The lizard known as the blue-tongued skink is normally inconspicuous  Only when threatened does it flash its huge broad tongue at its assailant 
The bright exposure of a vivid blue patch alarms the attacker and may save the lizard 's life  Several kinds of insects adopt a similar strategy 
Well camouflaged stick insects whose concealment has for once failed to work and who are about to be snapped at by a hungry predator will suddenly flick open their brightly coloured wings in a dramatically unexpected display that may shock the enemy into retreat  Some moths add an extra deterrent 
One West African species not only flicks open its wings to reveal a bright red abdomen but also bubbles out a stinking yellow froth from its body  Perhaps the most effective shock tactic is to create the impression that you are a lethal killer yourself and not to be trifled with 
Many a harmless animal manages to transform itself with a sudden display into what appears to be a vicious killer a scorpion a snake or a bird of prey  The camouflage devices employed are truly remarkable 
Some caterpillars possess the markings of small venomous snakes and when approached too closely will rear up on the branch and wave their fake snake-heads at the attacker  One kind of stick insect arches its abdomen and makes savage swipes through the air as if it is an attacking scorpion 
Only an exceptionally hungry or courageous predator will risk attacking such a creature and most prefer to play safe and leave well alone  When the camouflage of this praying mantis fails and a killer is closing in the insect adopts the last-ditch defence strategy of flashing its wings open and rearing up with its front legs spread 
This sudden transformation may help to scare away a timid attacker  By far the most common form of startle display involves the sudden exposure of a large pair of eyes 
It is not always possible to say precisely which kind of eyes these are pretending to be but the chances are that in most cases they are mimicking the forward-facing eyes of birds of prey  If a killer thinks even if only for a split second that it is face to face with an owl or an eagle it is very likely to back away and this may give the harmless bluffer enough time to escape 
Predators are usually nervous of attacking venomous species and this stick insect attempts to startle its assailants by adopting a scorpion posture when approached closely  By curving up its abdomen it gives the false impression that it is about to strike with its tail 
But these eye-spot displays are not confined to harmless species  One of the most deadly animals in the world the cobra employs just such a device 
As it rears up in self defence it spreads its wide hood to reveal a massive pair of eye-spots  To at least some of its attackers this pattern must be intimidating and its value is that it may allow the cobra to repel its enemy without resorting to the use of its precious venom 
In popular mythology poisonous snakes are always ready and waiting for the chance to strike out and kill their attackers  In reality they will do everything in their power to avoid this because the primary function of their venom is to incapacitate their prey and they can not afford to waste it unless they are driven to extremes 
So even a lethal cobra prefers to bluff an attacker if given the opportunity  Some caterpillars manage to startle their attackers by raising themselves up like small snakes 
Aiding them in their deception their rear ends look remarkably like snake-heads complete with impressive serpentine eyes  In the case of the citrus swallowtail caterpillar bottom there are false eyes near the front end of the body and just behind the animal 's real head an organ that looks like the forked tongue of a snake 
This is bright red and is extruded and flickered at the enemy when the caterpillar is disturbed  Enhancing its startling effect this forked tongue also gives off an unpleasant pungent odour 
Less well known than the cobra eye-spot display is a similar action by certain kinds of toads  Toads are poisonous too but like the cobra they prefer not to use their poison except as a last resort although for a different reason their poison glands only secrete their lethal dose when the toad is bitten hard by an attacker and for the toad this is leaving matters far too late with serious injury a strong possibility 
The alternative is to scare off the enemy and this is done by inflating the body and raising the rear end of it towards the approaching assailant  There on its otherwise camouflaged skin appears a pair of huge staring eye-spots that make its rear view look remarkably like the face of a predatory bird 
A pair of false eyes is also found on various higher forms of life including reptiles and birds  Startle eye-spots appear on the hood of the rearing cobra right and even on the back of the head of the pearl-spotted owlet above 
Many kinds of butterflies and moths perform similar startling transformations  The peacock butterfly normally rests with its wings pressed tightly together 
Their visible undersides are camouflaged but if the camouflage fails to work and the butterfly is attacked it then immediately opens its wings flat revealing two conspicuous pairs of eye-spots  Many moths like the eyed hawkmoth have a dramatic pair of eye-spots on their hind wings 
They rest with their wings flat but with the front wings covering their rear ones  Their front wings give them the protection of camouflage but they can be pulled forward rapidly when the moths are attacked to flash the startling false eyes 
An African praying mantis has even more spectacular eye-spots with an almost hypnotic spiral design that it employs in a similar way  In its case however the eye-spots are on the front wings and are exposed by suddenly spreading the folded wings and directing them at the attacker 
Most of the enemies of these insects are small birds out searching for a tasty meal  We know that the eye-spots do startle them because of a series of careful field-tests 
A special box was used on to the lid of which could be flashed a variety of patterns whenever a bird approached it  To attract the birds a mealworm was placed in the centre of the box and then as the bird alighted to attack the mealworm the box was illuminated to reveal a pair of eye-spots or some other pattern 
Using crosses dots and circles it was possible to find out which patterns were most effective in frightening away the birds  It established beyond doubt that it was the eye-spots that worked best and that the more realistic they were the more they startled the birds 
In particular it was found that if the fake eyes were shaded to look three-dimensional they made their biggest impact  This explains why so many of the eye-spots on the bodies of prey animals have evolved such a subtle and complex degree of mimicry 
Simple spots will not do but natural selection has met the challenge and has produced some truly amazing replicas complete even to glinting highlights  Insects with eye-spot startle displays include this remarkable bush cricket above 
At rest the cricket looks like a dead leaf but it transforms itself at the last moment  Many butterflies and moths such as this io moth possess a pair of startling eye-spots on their wings 
These are usually concealed and then flashed at the last moment giving the prospective predator the impression that it is approaching a much larger animal and one that is staring straight at it in a defiant manner  Field experiments have proved that this startle display does indeed deter attacks from small birds 
THE TRICK OF PLAYING possum is not confined to opossums  Acting as though dead has also been observed in a variety of insects frogs snakes birds squirrels and foxes 
In each case the animal when attacked suddenly collapses and remains immobile  Limp and apparently lifeless it permits itself to be mauled and prodded without twitching a muscle 
Then if left alone it quickly revives and makes a dash for freedom  It is a risky form of self-defence putting the animal completely at the mercy of its attacker 's jaws but it sometimes works and the bluffer escapes 
Among the insects death-feigning or thanatosis to give it its technical name occurs in some beetles bugs grasshoppers stick insects and mantids  Certain spiders also use it as a last resort 
Giant water bugs may go rigid when taken from the water and may hold this frozen posture for as long as fifteen minutes  Some species of small beetles behave in a similar fashion pulling all their legs in close to their bodies and lying absolutely still 
The larger longicorn beetles use a modified technique  When approached they may stay absolutely motionless and allow themselves to be picked up 
They appear to be in a catatonic state but this is deceptive because they may then suddenly bite the hand that holds them  This behavioural pattern gives them the chance to avoid detection initially by staying very still 
If caught they can avoid arousing the predator 's urge to kill through not wriggling and then panic the predator into dropping them by making a sudden unexpected attack  Once on the ground they may be able to get to safety before the killer strikes again 
Frogs and toads occasionally employ this device but it does not seem to be very widespread among these amphibians  Some respond to an attack by drawing their legs tightly against their bodies closing their eyes and staying completely still 
If a frog is climbing when it is attacked it may drop to the ground and lie there motionless for several minutes before risking an escape  Large bullfrogs have a special reaction 
If cornered they may thrust out their limbs in a fully stretched posture flatten their bodies and then hold this rigid spread-eagled pose until danger has passed  They will retain this tonic immobility even if they are placed on their backs giving certain human tricksters the chance to claim that they are capable of hypnotising frogs 
Of all the animals that sham dead it is the snakes that are the star performers some of them going to amazing lengths to convince their assailants that they are truly deceased  The most extraordinary example of death-feigning in the entire animal world is undoubtedly that shown by the West Indian wood snakes 
These are small boas which if molested first coil themselves up tightly then release a foul-smelling fluid from special glands giving the impression that they are rotting and that advanced putrefaction has already set in  Following this they release blood into their eyes which turns them a dull red colour 
But the climax of their act is the breaking open of small capillaries inside the mouth so that blood is seen trickling from their apparently lifeless jaws  This auto-haemorrhage as it is called is an astonishing refinement of the death-feigning strategy implying that predators pay a great deal of attention to minute details of their prey 's condition 
Chameleons have been known to death-feign lying inert on their sides with their feet held out stiffly and their eyes half-closed  Most snakes do not go this far 
Small tree snakes that sham dead do so simply by dropping to the ground when disturbed and lying there  The common European grass snake and the American hog-nosed snake both employ a death-feigning act which although elaborate suffers from what might be aptly described as a fatal weakness 
They begin well enough rolling on to their backs gaping the mouth awkwardly wide and allowing the long tongue to loll lifelessly from their sagging jaws  The impressive realism of this performance is totally ruined however if you bend down and turn the snake up the right way again 
It responds to this helpful adjustment by promptly inverting itself into the mock-dead posture  Even if the snake is turned over again and again it always flips itself back into the inverted posture an over-eager dying act that completely gives the game away 
Only when it is totally convinced that the danger is past will the snake finally and with great caution start to move away  It does so by first pulling in its tongue and closing its jaws 
Then it rotates just the head end of its body into the normal position  With the rest of its length still inverted it looks around and tests the air 
Then slowly very slowly it starts to slither away  If as it retreats it is approached closely once more it hurriedly flings itself upside-down again and resumes its forlorn death-pose 
Some snakes play dead by inverting themselves and lying limply on the ground but if they are turned over they spoil the effect by quickly inverting themselves again  The death-feigning snake often lies with its jaws gaping open and its tongue hanging out 
Then when the danger has passed it starts to turn itself slowly back to its normal posture beginning at the head end  This device is found in a variety of species including the grass snake right and the hognose snake below 
Birds rarely employ death-feigning but sometimes a small bird held in the human hand has been seen to collapse motionless and lie very still  If it is closely examined at this point it appears to have died from shock but then a few moments later it may revive miraculously and fly off 
It is a trick that might just save the life of the bird if a cat has caught it and then placed it on the ground for a moment before starting to pluck it  Cats do often pause after catching their prey and momentarily release what they imagine is a corpse before settling down to the business of eating it 
So it is possible that avian death-feigning is tuned in to this one crucial moment of possible escape  If the bird keeps struggling it will be clawed and bitten repeatedly by its captor but if it lies still the cat may then make the mistake of putting it down on the ground and releasing it from its jaws 
Among the mammals some South American foxes have been seen to play dead when caught as have certain squirrels  A little African ground squirrel gave a most convincing performance when examined by a zoologist 
The young squirrel had been caught and placed in a box  When the box arrived the zoologist took the animal out to examine it only to see it keel over and lie motionless on her hand 
No respiration was visible the eyes were closed the mouth gaped and the paws were rigid  The zoologist was upset because she felt that the small animal had suffered from the journey in the box and she was responsible for its death 
She tried to feed it with a little warm milk but there was no swallowing response  Putting the corpse down she gave up and was gazing sadly at the small body when about two minutes after its death it suddenly took a few very deep breaths and started to move about 
It became such a tame pet afterwards that she could never persuade it to play dead again even if she grabbed it as though she were a predator  It was now too much at home with her for the response to be triggered 
The animal most famous for shamming dead is of course the American opossum  It is the species in which this curious behaviour has been studied most thoroughly with some surprising results 
When attacked the opossum 's first reaction is to fight back  It possesses a large number of small but very sharp teeth and can inflict a painful bite if given half a chance 
It hisses like a snake growls like a carnivore and snaps out at its tormenter  If this fails to deter the enemy the possum promptly drops dead 
It collapses dramatically on to its side its body limp and lifeless its back slightly bent and its head turned down so that it has a half-curled-up appearance  Like the best fakers from the snake world it displays a slackly open mouth with its tongue lolling out and its eyes are half-closed 
The American opossum has given its name to death-feigning  When playing possum it lies limply on the ground and can even be bitten hard by an attacker without showing any response 
In this pathetic condition it is completely immune to any pain that may be inflicted upon it  Even if bitten or pecked it continues to lie limply on the ground 
What is the mechanism in the animal 's nervous system that makes this possible  It used to be a popular theory that death-feigning animals were somehow self-hypnotised or that they were thrown into such an acute state of shock by their tormentors that they went into an unconscious cataleptic state as though from a fit or seizure 
Others likened it to fainting a dead faint that switched off all the animal 's faculties  But careful studies in the 1960S revealed that none of these explanations will do 
Employing an electroencephalogram to measure the brain waves of opossums when awake when asleep and when playing dead investigators were surprised to find that the condition of the brain when death-feigning is taking place is the same as that in the wide-awake animal  There was no sign of any special or unusual wave pattern during the minutes when the animal was apparently lifeless 
This study showed that the opossum does not experience some kind of fit or paralytic unconsciousness  Indeed it must be fully aware of what is happening to it when it is playing dead 
In some strange way however it is incapable of putting its usual pain reactions into operation  The mystery that remains concerns the almost insoluble problem of whether the possum feels the pain when it is being bitten but is incapable of responding to it or whether it feels nothing even though it knows it is being bitten 
In other words is it a sensitive but totally incapacitated animal or one that is effectively self-anaesthetised  Whatever the answer may be it is certain that we are dealing with an extremely strange reaction here and one that might repay much greater attention 
It has been argued that death-feigning in natural circumstances is of comparatively little use and far too risky to become a major defence strategy  If a killer is faced with a quiet prey rather than one that is resisting violently it will simply be able to enjoy an easier meal 
If the prey obligingly offers itself as an immobilised piece of meat what advantage does it gain  Clearly this view is mistaken or the death-feigning reaction would never have evolved 
Despite the superficial stupidity of the action it must have some special advantage in at least enough cases for it to have been the subject of natural selection  The answer seems to lie in certain predators ' need for prey-movement during the hunting process 
Predators that never scavenge and always insist on eating freshly-killed prey will have their appetite switched off by a limp static object  Many animal killers like their prey to writhe and scream not because they are sadistic but simply because that is the way they can ensure that they are about to eat fresh healthy food 
For them the seemingly dead animal is far less enticing  If this makes them pause even briefly it may be just enough for the prey to escape 
There is another function of playing dead that has been depicted for centuries but which until recently was thought to be no more than a fictitious folk-tale  As long ago as the twelfth century there appeared in the early bestiaries an illustration of a cunning fox feigning death surrounded by birds 
He lies upside-down with his eyes closed his mouth open and his tongue hanging out  The birds are hungry and gather round the corpse to eat it 
Then at the last moment the fox leaps up and catches them devouring them instead  Nobody took this fable seriously until in 1961 a Russian film-maker managed to record it actually happening 
There in the film is a fox lying limply on the ground  A carrion crow approaches it and prepares to start feasting on its body 
All at once the fox leaps round catches and kills the crow and makes a meal of it  Sometimes nature is just as strange as ancient legends 
The legend of the fox that traps birds by pretending to be dead has been depicted for centuries  It was shown in the fourteenth-century Queen Mary Psalter and many times in the centuries that followed but it was later rejected as an imaginative fiction 
Then in 1961 a Russian film-maker managed to record the event and prove for once that an old legend is also a scientific fact  ANYONE WHO HAS LOST a finger in an accident will be painfully aware that the human species is incapable of regrowing lost appendages 
This is one of the ways in which we are inferior to the so-called lower forms of animal life  The best we can do is to grow a covering of skin over the stump where the amputation occurred 
In this respect other mammals and birds share our short-coming  To find the most advanced animals that show regular regeneration of lost organs we must turn to the reptiles and in particular to the lizards 
For them losing their tails as a way of saving their heads is a common event and is a specialised process known as autotomy which literally means self-cutting  Autotomy takes place when a lizard is not quick enough to elude the attentions of a hungry predator 
As the killer strikes at the retreating reptile it is the victim 's tail that is most likely to be caught in claws or jaws  At the moment of impact the tail of the lizard breaks away from its body 
The lizard is then able to rush away to safety while the predator momentarily confused by the suddenness of what has happened concentrates all its efforts on the disembodied tail  The tail wriggles and writhes in its mouth or in its claws and its liveliness preoccupies the would-be killer to such an extent that it hardly notices the rapidly escaping form of the rest of the lizard 
The neuromuscular system of the discarded tail is capable of continuing to produce vigorous twisting movements for several minutes after the attack has occurred  This engrossing spectacle fascinates the predator who may eventually devour the tail although it has little nutritional value 
We know that the trick works because lizards ' tails have been found in the stomachs of a wide variety of predators including carnivorous birds and snakes  When autotomy was first observed it was thought that the killer simply ripped off the tail by brute force but closer study revealed that many lizards especially geckos have evolved special break-points in their tails weak spots that fracture with great ease and make the sacrifice a simple matter 
For such animals the lightest touch on the tail is enough to produce automatic contractions that split the tail away from its base  Some species are even capable of sheding their tails without any contact at all 
If such a lizard is caught by the body it is still the tail that snaps off separating from its base independently of any external pressure  It might seem obvious that if weak points are going to evolve in the tails of lizards they would do so between the vertebrae 
But this is not the case  Strangely the fracture planes pass through the middle of the vertebrae and not in the spaces between them 
In a typical lizard every tail vertebra from the sixth one onwards has a special plane of weakness where a thin layer of cartilage replaces the stronger bony tissue  At these points there are also constrictions in the blood vessels and nerves and weaknesses in the connective tissues 
So when the circular muscles of the tail perform their sudden massive contraction the whole of the tail section disconnects with ease  Because of the constrictions in the blood vessels rather like the necks of hour-glasses there is practically no loss of blood and the blunt end of the tail-stump quickly dries off and hardens 
Many lizards such as the green lizard above and the blue-tailed skink below are capable of breaking off their tails when they are molested  A dropped tail continues to wriggle keeping the attention of the predator focused on it while the prey makes its escape 
The mutilated lizard will then slowly regrow a new tail although it is usually rather imperfect  A lizard without its tail is at a considerable disadvantage 
The tail is used in running swimming balancing and climbing not to mention courtship and display  Lizards that have lost their tails by autotomy do not live as long as those that manage to retain them nor do they breed as efficiently 
But they do at least survive and after a period of time will be able to regrow their tails  This is a slow and imperfect process but it does give them back most of their original caudal functions 
The only attribute their regrown tail lacks totally is the capacity to be discarded again  This is because it does not develop ordinary vertebrae but contains instead a central rod of cartilage 
This provides a rudder that is capable of assisting in balancing and locomotion but has no break-points for further tail-dropping  The age of the lizard is important in determining the quality of its second tail 
A young lizard can regrow one that is almost as long as the original  An older lizard tends to produce a somewhat abbreviated stumpy appendage and sometimes the regeneration goes horribly wrong and the unfortunate animal finds itself growing not one but two or even three new tails at once 
In this condition its mobility is severely hampered but it still has a chance of survival if its environment is benign  Of the sixteen families of lizards alive today eleven of them have species that demonstrate tail-sacrifice 
Crocodiles are also capable of some slight degree of regeneration after losing a tail-tip but the process is far less efficient than with lizards  Some snakes lose their tail-tips with comparative ease under duress but unlike their four-legged relatives they are incapable of any regrowth 
Invertebrates are more efficient at regrowing lost parts  A starfish can regrow all its arms if necessary even if the mutilation is severe 
Certain lizards some of the skinks and the geckos sacrifice another part of their body when they are grabbed by a predator  Their trick is to have a very loosely connected skin so free from the underlying tissue that a sudden gripping pressure can break it away leaving the killer with only a mouthful of the instantly shed skin 
The now almost naked lizard scampers away to safety and quickly regrows a new outer covering  This is highly efficient but is no more than a slight modification of the normal skin-shedding process quite an easy evolutionary step for any reptilian species to make especially in comparison with the natural ligature device in the lizard 's tail 
The only other vertebrate animals to show an efficient form of self-mutilation are certain amphibians especially salamanders  Some of them aid the deception by raising their tails and wagging them at the approaching attacker while keeping the rest of the body still 
This attracts the predator towards the tail and protects the rest of the body  The tail when bitten may then be broken off at a weak spot near the base where there is a slight constriction 
But the natural ligature is of a different kind from that of the lizards  Here the plane of weakness is between two vertebrae instead of through the middle of one 
After it has been sacrificed the salamander 's tail wriggles about just like the lizard 's tail but it has the additional advantage that it often contains poison glands which the killer finds pungently distasteful  As a result the predator is far less likely to attack a second individual of this type of prey 
The tactical loss of part of the body and its subsequent regrowth is far more common among the animals without backbones the invertebrates  Here it can be observed in worms starfish crabs and molluscs 
Their less advanced bodies appear to be easier to reconstitute than those of the higher animals  Starfish and brittlefish will readily jettison an arm or two when attacked and are capable of quickly growing new arms to replace them 
Crabs throw off a leg if it is grabbed by a predator and scuttle away to the safety of a nearby crevice  If they are dragged out again they will release a second leg then a third 
But they become less and less likely to make further sacrifices until when they are literally on their last legs they can not be persuaded to give up any more limbs no matter how hard the killer grabs hold of them  This increasing reluctance makes sense 
A crab missing a few legs may have enough running power left to survive but a crab that is completely legless might as well be dead  Some crabs employ an aggressive form of autotomy 
Instead of waiting for the predator to attack them they use their powerful claws to turn the tables  They grab hold of the killer 's flesh clamp tight and then cast off the claw 
This has been observed when otters have been hunting crabs  The hapless mammal is left with a pair of savage chelae pinching it tight while the crab makes its escape 
The otter has no alternative but to retreat in agony and attempt to prize the claws free  By the time it has done this the crab is safe 
With the next moult it will have regrown its missing claw although the new one is by no means as impressive as the original  Bees and wasps will leave their stings in the flesh of their enemies employing a similarly aggressive form of self-mutilation 
Unfortunately for them this act is final  Not only are they incapable of regrowing the stings but they also can not live without them 
The survival value of this act lies not with the individual but with its hive community  Perhaps the most remarkable example of self-mutilation that inflicts pain on the attacker is the breaking off of poisonous papillae by various kinds of sea slugs 
The colourful animals naked marine snails often display clusters of finger-shaped bladders along their upper surfaces  When approached by a predatory fish these little creatures contract their bodies and expand their papillae which they then wave about in the water 
The fish snaps at these enticingly offered morsels and finds that it is comparatively easy to bite one off  It discovers its mistake a fraction of a second later for these strange organs contain poison glands and sometimes also additional stinging-cells acquired from the anemones on which the sea slugs themselves feed 
Fish quickly learn to give these conspicuous little molluscs a wide berth so that the loss of papillae is not too frequent  But even when it does occur it does not provide too much of a problem for the sea slugs are capable of quickly regenerating them ready for the next naÃ¯ve fish to attack 
Some crabs are capable of throwing off their arms if they are grabbed by a predator This common shore crab is in the process of regenerating a sacrificed right claw  Some sea slugs have conspicuous brightly coloured growths on the tops of their bodies 
These coloured papillae can be enlarged when a predator approaches and are then waved about invitingly  If the attacker bites one off it can soon be regrown 
The papillae are highly distasteful and deter fish from making a second assault  THE AMAZING LENGTHS to which parent animals will go to protect their young has fascinated animal-watchers for centuries 
As far back as the fourth century one of the founding fathers of the Greek Orthodox Church Saint Basil reported with admiration and astonishment that a parent bird may risk its life for its nestlings by attempting to lure a predator away from the nest  It achieved this he noted by pretending to be injured dragging itself along the ground as if it had a broken wing 
In this way it gave the predator hope of an easy catch something it could not resist  Instead of going closer to the nest and finding the genuinely helpless nestlings the killer followed the apparently helpless adult bird 
At the last minute the parent would abandon its charade and fly off to safety  Saint Basil was so enchanted by this selfless action that he concluded his comments with the words If things seen are so lovely what must things unseen be 
Certainly this is not the sort of behaviour that modern judges have in mind when they refer to young thugs as behaving like animals  Seen by romantic eyes it is the epitome of the nobility of nature but what is the truth of the situation 
Are the parent birds really putting themselves at risk for their offspring laying down their own lives so that their young may live  Even a brief moment of objective analysis reveals that this can not be so 
For if the parent bird were to be attacked and killed by the predator all its young would inevitably perish for subsequent lack of parental care  So for the trick to work the parent must always be perfectly safe 
The risk is only apparent  Nevertheless distraction displays are by any standards remarkable patterns of animal behaviour and require some explanation 
Displays of this kind are found in a wide variety of birds but they are most common in the ground-nesting species  There is a special reason for this 
Tree-nesting species if they are being approached by a predator have little hope of concealing their nests  Having spotted them the predator will know where they are even if it is momentarily distracted by the parent bird 
The best hope for tree-nests is that they should be inaccessible  Failing that the parent bird 's most useful strategy is to attack the climbing killer as it approaches the nest-site 
Diving at it and pecking it may just be enough to unsettle it as it makes the difficult final climb  Alternatively the parent bird can flee and live to rear another clutch of eggs elsewhere 
The only other course of action for a tree-nester is to hop about in the tree squawking and screeching noisily in an attempt to break the attacker 's concentration  This is a crude form of distraction display but it can not be developed much further because of the context in which it occurs 
The climbing predator is in no position to start chasing after the cackling parent bird no matter how tempting it may be  Up in the branches this does not make sense 
Down on the ground matters are very different  For a start the nest its eggs its nestlings and its owners are all highly camouflaged 
Ground-nests are so well concealed that predators can easily overlook them even when they are only a few feet away  So it pays the nest-owners to sit tight and hope that the killers will pass them by 
If this fails then clearly the eggs or young are at a serious risk  When the parent bird with the predator only inches away finally takes flight the nest is horribly vulnerable its position revealed and all too easily accessible 
This is the moment at which a major diversion is necessary  To attack the predator while it is in a stable position on the ground is far riskier than to do so when it is clinging to high branches 
The diving and pecking routine would have little impact and might expose the nest-owners to serious injury or death  Only powerful birds would stand a chance 
For the rest something else is needed and that is where the distraction display comes into operation  At ground level the nest-owner can make exaggerated movements away from the nest and draw the killer towards itself 
The combination of inconspicuous nest conspicuous display and easy terrain makes this the ideal context for this type of reaction  The display must be more than just conspicuous 
It must also be tantalisingly attractive to a hungry predator  And nothing appeals to an experienced hunter more than a wounded or somehow disabled prey 
If the parent bird can appear to be at some grave physical disadvantage the killer will find the tempting proximity of the vulnerable adult irresistible and its concentration on the location of the nest-site can be broken  Once it has been led farther and farther away from the nest by the parent bird it will have difficulty in rediscovering the position of the nest and will in all probability set off to search elsewhere if it fails to make a killing 
A successful distraction display therefore requires five stages  First the bird must sit tight on the nest until the last moment 
Second it must fly swiftly away from the nest and alight some distance from it  Third it must perform its conspicuous super-prey routine until it attracts the attention of the predator 
Fourth it must continue this display while moving away from the nest  And fifth it must be alert enough to judge perfectly the moment for a sudden recovery and flight to safety 
The most remarkable phase of this sequence is the super-prey display  It takes two distinct forms in different species 
These have been christened the broken-wing display and the rodent-run  In the broken-wing performance the realism is so remarkable that even human observers can be fooled when they first encounter it 
Having flown away from the nest the bird flutters to the ground and then pathetically tries to run away limping and dragging one outstretched wing along the ground  Sometimes it flops to the ground as if exhausted 
Its feathers are ruffled as those of a genuinely sick bird would be and this ruffling often exposes bright patches of plumage that add to the conspicuousness of the display  If the parent bird is aquatic and is making its display on water it may turn on its side flap one wing awkwardly in the air and paddle itself in a circle as if it is hopelessly crippled 
Even while they are staggering about fluttering and floundering these mock-disabled birds are fully aware of everything around them  They are not suffering some kind of seizure brought on by the fear of the nearby predator 
All their actions are counterfeit  An early observer was amused to notice that certain shore-nesting birds took great care about the way they performed their imitation death throes The end comes slowly surely a miserable flurry and scraping the dying stilt however even in articulo mortis contriving to avoid inconvenient stones upon which decently to expire 
In other words these are ritualised displays triggered off by the stimulus of predator-near-nest  Whatever their origin they are now highly controlled and automatic responses to this situation 
They represent an elaborate piece of behavioural mimicry and appear to be inborn  Indeed a Galapagos dove was seen to perform a distraction display on an island where there had been no predators for countless years 
When humans arrived the dove demonstrated a behaviour pattern that it must have inherited from its ancient ancestors and kept in storage ever since  Many ground-nesting birds employ a distraction display that draws an approaching predator away from the nest-site where vulnerable eggs or chicks are situated 
The display seen here performed by a thick-knee top a kildeer above and a semi-palmated plover opposite top and bottom usually consists of a simulated injury the body is rolled on one side and an apparently broken wing trailed along the ground  The damaged bird struggles away from the nest followed closely by the would-be killer 
When the predator comes too close the parent bird suddenly leaps up and flies to safety  The rodent-run display takes an entirely different form and is employed especially where the local predatory species are always on the alert for small rats mice or lemmings 
The bird jumps from its nest at the last minute and runs off making a special squeaking call  Its body is hunched up in a strange way with its wings drooped its feathers ruffled and its head lowered 
In its humped posture it runs along in a zigzag path quivering its wings and stopping every so often to make sure that it is being followed  If the predator ignores this tempting performance the little bird quickly flies back and runs close to it moving with great agitation 
It then starts off on another rodent-run watching to see if it is followed  It continues to do this until the predator is safely in pursuit and is moving farther and farther away from the nest 
The bravery of a parent bird when defending its nest is remarkable as is proved by this blacksmith plover 's display towards an intruding elephant  Although the elephant is not a predator it could easily damage the nest and it must somehow be persuaded to take another route 
The little bird is dwarfed by the giant pachyderm but does not hesitate to perform its distraction display at close quarters  There are many minor variations from species to species but these two types of distraction display are the basic forms 
Their strangeness is a testimony to the sensitivity of the predators  No crude display will suffice to decoy them 
The performance has to be convincing or they will not be lured away from the vulnerable nest or young  And they have to be safe for the performers so that the nest-owners can survive to continue their parental duties 
Their inner mood must remain one of complete alertness to be ready to make the final dash to safety  They may appear to be fainting collapsing and suffering from shock but in reality they can be none of these things 
Everything must be a sham  In which case how did they develop these extraordinary actions during the course of evolution 
What is their origin  Even the mighty ostrich has been known to resort to this form of deception 
Instead of risking an attack on the predator that is approaching the nest the parent bird sometimes runs awkwardly away flapping its wings as if in difficulties  At any moment it can switch to full-speed running 
The predator by the time it has given up the chase will probably have forgotten the exact location of the nest and will not be able to retrace its steps  The ostrich on the other hand will eventually be able to return to the spot it knows so well where it can resume its parental duties 
As with all displays the unusual movements and postures are the result of a state of conflict  In this case the conflict is between the urge to flee from the predator and the urge to attack it 
At the same time there is a conflict between wanting to be on the nest and away from the nest  Originally this state must have led to a great deal of contradictory and ambivalent behaviour with the bird being tugged in opposite directions by its opposing moods 
Clashing intention movements of coming and going autonomic disturbances leading to harsh vocalisations and feather erections and agitated changes of direction could all be expected to occur  If this were a simple conflict between attack and escape it would have led to threat displays 
These would have evolved in such a way that the displayer would have appeared bigger and more frightening  But intimidation is not the function of distraction displays 
Here selection has favoured display developments that make the birds look not fearsome but disabled  The elements selected from the confusion of conflicting movements have this different and very distinctive bias 
In particular a combination in which one part of the animal flees and the other part stays still is favoured  This has produced the broken-wing display 
The flapping wing says I am frightened and the stationary wing says I will not retreat  Together this gives the awkward asymmetrical display that mimics injury 
In the case of the curious rodent-run display it is as if the bird is running away and hiding at the same time  The strangely crouching posture with the head down and the body hunched seems to have been taken from the hiding-by-staying-put-on-the-nest repertoire while the running away and squealing has been taken from the escape repertoire 
Put together along with a run/don't-run locomotion compromise they create the rodent mimicry that appeals so much to certain killers  But whatever their origins these distraction displays are now reactions in their own right 
They have become emancipated from their roots and exist as trigger reactions to the approach of predators  They are however finely tuned to the parental condition of the birds 
They are most readily shown at the times when the young are hatching and again when they are fledging  These are the most intense parental periods for the birds and the increase in parental arousal affects the frequency of the distraction displays 
Distraction displays are almost entirely confined to birds but there are a few examples from elsewhere notably in a fish called the bowfin  This is a nest-building species in which the male guards the young fry after they hatch 
They cluster around him in a dense shoal and follow him as he moves about  They are the favourite prey of certain predatory fish and the male parent is reputed to perform a distraction display at certain times 
He does this by moving away from the shoal of fry and then thrashing about in the water as if injured  In this way he may succeed in attracting the attention of the predator away from the vulnerable fry 
Other distraction displays of a completely different nature are those in which the displayer attempts to distract the attacker from itself  No young are involved 
For example the cuttlefish when attacked releases a large blob of ink into the water  Originally it was believed that this was a simple smokescreen a kind of instant fog in which the cuttlefish became hidden and could escape 
But careful observation suggests that this is not the case  The blob of ink initially hangs together and does not disperse immediately 
Floating in the water it is suddenly more noticeable than the cuttlefish itself  The blob is black in colour while the cuttlefish instantly becomes cryptically pale and the mollusc sneaks away almost invisibly while the attacker assaults the vividly conspicuous blob of ink 
Another self-protection form of distraction is practised by certain orb-web spiders  These animals are frequently attacked by predatory wasps and they divert the killers by wrapping up the remains of insects or egg cocoons and positioning them in their webs 
Being roughly the same size and shape as the spiders they act as decoys attracting the attention of the wasps and sparing the spiders  This spotted sea hare above is a mollusc that can squirt a cloud of purple ink into the water in response to the approach of a predator 
This display distracts the attention of the would-be killer from the retreating form of the prey  The octopus below and the cuttlefish both use a similar strategy when under attack but their ink blob is dark brown or black 
SMALL BIRDS suffer from a lifelong fear of birds of prey especially owls  It is an inborn fear that develops when they are only a few months old regardless of whether they have ever met an owl 
In general it results in their avoiding owls at all costs but occasionally they turn the tables on the killer bird the tormented become the tormentors  Instead of fleeing they stand their ground and confront the owl 
Screeching an alarm call they attract more and more small birds to the scene until the bird of prey is surrounded by a noisy angry mob  They now start to harass the bigger bird calling incessantly and loudly twisting and jerking their bodies and even making mock attacks 
Sometimes a particularly bold individual will risk a real attack swooping in from behind the owl and striking at its plumage  This mobbing behaviour never occurs when the predator is actively hunting 
It is most likely to occur when the bird of prey is behaving in an odd way  If it is injured or sick it may sit quietly in an unusually visible position during daylight hours 
A conspicuous stationary owl is a major target for mobbing  The small birds gather round and approach it remarkably closely often as near as lo feet and then start to display 
The exact movements vary from species to species but in a typical finch such as the chaffinch the body is turned towards the owl the crown-feathers are raised the legs are bent the wings are slightly raised and the body is jerked quickly from side to side in a crouched bent-leg posture while the tail flicks up and down  Many species have been observed to indulge in this strange mobbing display including finches tits buntings warblers blackbirds thrushes and even little hummingbirds 
The hummingbirds become particularly hostile buzzing around the big bird 's head as close as 2 inches from its face calling out and jabbing at its eyes  Some of the larger birds like the blackbirds and thrushes often risk a little dive-bombing in which they swoop down on the owl from a distance of about 30 feet heading straight for it and then swerve aside only at the very last moment when they are no more than a foot away 
Sometimes they leap at it from behind and claw at its head feathers  The excitement is contagious with many new birds arriving and performing the mobbing display without even seeing the bird of prey that is causing the commotion 
They witness the behaviour of the other small mobbers and simply follow suit  They become so excited during this gang warfare that humans can approach them much more closely than at other times 
And their arousal is so intense that if the owl finally departs they will still go on mobbing for a long while afterwards as though they can not calm down to a normal level of activity until some considerable time has passed  If a large predatory bird sits in a conspicuous position it may find itself being mobbed by smaller birds which call display and even attempt to dive-bomb it with pecking attacks 
When it flies away it may be Pursued until it has left the vicinity as is happening with this beleaguered golden eagle being chased by a group of aggressive ravens  The beleaguered owl finds the whole encounter highly distasteful and confusing 
Its bearing suggests that it is irritated and jarred by what is taking place around it  It becomes increasingly ill at ease until eventually the din and the intrusions become too much for it and it flaps off to find a quieter spot somewhere else 
And this of course is the function of the combined display onslaught  The owl will not forget the ordeal and may in future avoid that particular neck of the woods 
For the local small birds this is a huge advantage  Sometimes a solitary individual is brave enough to act as a one-bird mob and attack a predator on its own as this roller is doing worrying a martial eagle 
The actions employed by the displaying birds are clearly those of animals in conflict  Fear of the owl makes the birds want to flee and anger at its obtrusive presence makes them want to attack 
In addition there is a considerable element of curiosity on the part of the little birds they want to learn all they can about this dreaded enemy while it is for once sitting quietly  Although serious research on the subject of mobbing did not begin until around the time of the Second World War it has been known as a natural phenomenon for over 2,500 years 
There is an exceptionally beautiful Greek vase depicting mobbing dating from the sixth century BC  It is a black-figure amphora showing a tree with ten branches and an owl tethered near by 
On either side of this scene there crouches a human watcher and the air is filled with small birds thirty-one of them altogether  Some appear to be stuck to the branches and one or two are distinctly fluttering their wings as if in some kind of trouble 
What this early artist has illustrated is mobbing behaviour being exploited to trap small birds which would have been destined to be served up at table  The tethered owl deliberately employed as a decoy attracted the flock of small birds to the spot where many of them alighted on the branches of the nearby tree 
And this was their undoing because the surfaces of the branches had earlier been covered with lime to make it impossible for them to take flight again ever again  The owl was being used as bait 
The most common victim of mobbing is the owl and this phenomenon has been known for centuries  The earliest depiction of it is on a sixth century B. C. black-figure amphora above from Greece 
This shows that human bird-catchers had already learnt to exploit the mobbing reaction  By placing a tethered owl under a tree the branches of which had been covered with sticky lime it was possible to trap small birds as they gathered to mob the bird of prey 
Their feet became stuck and they could then easily be caught and killed for the pot  This reveals a close understanding of the phenomenon and shows that it was well known even at this early date 
A little later in Ancient Roman times the mobbing display again appears in the art of the day  This time it is on an elaborate mosaic where an owl is shown sitting in the middle of a ring of attacking animals 
Symbolically the owl sits on an Evil Eye that has been pierced by a spear suggesting that the owl 's own Evil Eye has been incapacitated by the mobbing display  Later still in a Medieval bestiary three courageous birds are shown in the act of attacking an owl 's head 
One of these birds is depicted as a magpie  Much later in the eighteenth century the Spanish artist Goya shows a caged owl being swooped upon by two free-flying birds while a small caged bird sits nervously in front of it 
The indication here is that the caged finch has been placed close to the owl in order to provoke it into prolonged alarm calling that will attract others of its kind  The netting thrown over the tree in the background is obviously intended to trap these newcomers as they arrive to mob the owl 
This seventeenth-century mosaic above right illustrates the way in which different species of small birds may uniquely work together to deal with the shared problem of seeing off a feared predator  Below A mockingbird is here seen boldly attacking a great horned owl 
In modern times interest has centred around what it is about the owl that makes it the target for this hostile treatment  Field tests using stuffed owls and wooden dummies quickly established which features are important 
To be an effective owl a model should possess the following qualities a big head a short neck a short tail solid contours brown or grey colouring a patterned surface with spots or streaks a beak and frontally directed eyes  The more of these properties a dummy possessed the more strongly it was mobbed but it seemed to make little difference whether the object was a stuffed owl with real plumage or an owl-shaped piece of painted wood 
If the key elements of owlness were absent or only a few were present the birds showed some curiosity about the dummy but were not stimulated to perform the full mobbing response  One particular owl quality that is. sufficient by itself to attract mobbing birds is the characteristic hooting sound it makes 
In the days when hummingbird feathers were fashionable costume accessories the plumage hunters of Trinidad used to imitate the hooting of owls to draw the unfortunate hummingbirds towards them and to their deaths  Although they produce the strongest reactions owls are not the only animals to provoke mobbing reactions 
Other birds of prey may also arouse strong responses if they sit in a conspicuous position during the daylight hours  Also field experiments with a stuffed cuckoo quickly revealed that this too was attacked by small birds 
At first the mobbers showed the typical agitated response but then when the stuffed bird failed to retaliate they dashed in for violent physical assaults on its body  They savagely plucked feathers from it and were so carried away by their onslaught that they even continued attacking when the stuffed bird was held in the experimenter 's hand close to his face 
At one point to suppress attacks a large handkerchief was thrown over the stuffed cuckoo but the enraged birds in this case nightingales would not give up and assaulted the handkerchief instead  Such is the passion of the mob 
Field experiments with stuffed birds also demonstrate that different species of small birds all close in for the attack on a hated enemy in this case not a predator but a cuckoo  The stuffed cuckoo is bombarded by a frenzied reed warbler and a belligerent pair of nightingales 
The willow warbler is even prepared to assault a stuffed cuckoo head  Snakes have been mobbed from time to time by groups of ground squirrels 
The little rodents make brave taunting rushes at the deadly reptiles and sometimes even risk delivering a lightning bite to their bodies  Another technique they employ is throwing sand or dust into the snake 's face 
Put under this pressure and without an isolated adversary on which to concentrate its lethal strike the snake usually does its best to beat a rapid retreat  Again safety in numbers saves the day for the prey species 
Like small birds small mammals may occasionally indulge in mobbing to rid themselves of a feared killer  Here in the Kalahari a group of meerkats is angrily seeing off a deadly yellow cobra 
Some predatory mammals also provoke mobbing reactions  Foxes often avoid the colony sites of breeding seabirds because if they attempt a swift invasion to capture nestlings they are liable to find themselves the object of severe and painful dive-bombing by the parent gulls and their companions 
The gulls swoop down striking at the fox 's head and the predator quickly retreats to safety  Baboons will gang up on a leopard in a similar way although this is a risky venture 
But here too the presence of a group of agitated hostile prey animals all assembled together as an opposing force is usually too much for the predator  Every killer has its own special modus operandi or MO to use a police term and it does not take kindly to being forced to attack in circumstances that do not favour its special hunting style 
An angry mob creates confusion and prevents the smooth running of its hunting sequence  Its decision is therefore almost always to show restraint and to leave the scene as quietly as possible 
The hunt will occur later on its own terms and in its own time  When mobbing occurs the situation is far too unpredictable from second to second to suit even the most lethal predator 
Chimpanzees have been observed to indulge in mobbing in certain unusual cases  One intrepid field-worker took an electrically animated stuffed leopard into the forests of West Africa placed it in a clearing near a group of chimpanzees and hid in the bushes near by 
When the chimpanzees came close to the leopard he activated its mechanism so that it started to move its head  The apes ' reaction was astonishing 
Film of the event shows that they immediately ganged up on the leopard rushing at it screaming stamping their feet and throwing objects at it  Eventually one of them attacked it with a large branch striking it a damaging blow 
This is so reminiscent of the way human mobs have all too often treated wild animals they have encountered that it is just one more reminder of how closely related humans and chimpanzees are  THERE ARE ABOUT one and a half million different kinds of life forms on the planet today 
Of these 1,124,000 are animals and 359,000 are plants  The animal species are divided as follows to the nearest thousand 
4,000 Mammals  9,000 Birds 
6,000 Reptiles  3,000 Amphibians 
20,000 Fish  80,000 Molluscs shellfish octopuses and squids 
4,000 Echinoderms starfish and sea-urchins  923,000 Arthropods insects spiders scorpions and crustaceans 
9,000 Coelenterates jellyfish sea-anemones and corals  66,000 Lower Forms worms and microbes 
Every one of these species has evolved its own special way of finding food but they fall into eleven basic categories  At the top of the scale come the predators animals that live largely by killing other animals 
Some are highly specialised and limit themselves to one particular type of prey refusing all other kinds of meat even though it may be highly nutritious  Others are opportunists killing anything they can catch and devouring it with relish 
The specialists tend to live rather quiet often secretive lives while the opportunists scamper hither and thither always on the lookout for a new kind of meal  Eagles snakes and cats are typical lazy specialists and crows mongooses and dogs are typical busy opportunists 
The use of the word lazy here does not imply that those animals are indolent or inefficient but rather that their specialisation is so finely tuned and successful that they are able to spend a great deal of their daily lives sitting gazing and sleeping  The opportunists by contrast must be forever searching and sniffing exploring and checking 
The supreme predator is the cheetah opposite top the fastest animal on four legs capable of reaching speeds of over 50 miles an hour  But its chase is brief averaging less than 200 yards and if it fails to catch its prey within this short dash it gives up 
If it does catch it it knocks it to the ground and then grabs its throat in its strong jaws killing it by suffocation  These are two totally different ways of life each with its own rewards 
The difference becomes crucially important when animals are brought into captivity as in zoos or menageries  The specialists are then much easier to satisfy providing they are given the right kind of food they are content to sit and stare out from their cages much as they would sit and stare out at their wild landscapes 
But the opportunists suffer terribly under these conditions  Even if well fed they can not stop searching and exploring as this has become an end in itself in their behaviour repertoire 
Their problem is often that there is nothing to explore except a bare concrete cell and this frustrates them intensely  To watch such animals biting their own bodies as a way of providing novel stimulation is to see just how inadequate even the most modern zoos are for this type of species 
Opportunist feeders must have a rich and complex environment if they are to thrive  Zoos really can not provide this without giving them enormous pseudo-natural enclosures 
African hunting dogs opposite bottom attack their prey in a pack pursuing them for several miles if necessary  Their secret is stamina rather than speed and when they have worn down their prey the kill is clumsy but efficient 
They simply tear at the flesh of the victim until the animal is weak from loss of blood when they pull it over and start to devour it  Smaller prey are disembowelled and then eaten while still alive 
In the wild the specialist predators may spend only a very small percentage of their time in the pursuit of food  A kill every few days is often enough for the predators of large prey 
After each kill they can feast and rest then slowly digest the flesh on which they have gorged themselves  This is food of the highest quality and their feeding technique although always involving the risk of physical injury is the most efficient of all 
The lion is an ambush killer  With its heavy body it is only capable of reaching speeds of about 35 miles an hour some 15 miles an hour slower than many of its prey and so it requires stealth and surprise rather than speed to catch them 
Encirclement of prey is a common strategy as in wolf hunting and the frantic victim finds it difficult to escape the group attack  It is knocked to the ground by a heavy blow seized by the throat or mouth and quickly suffocated 
The pride then move in to share the feast  The smaller the prey becomes the more labour is needed to obtain adequate nutrition 
Each victim has to be tracked and killed and yet it provides only a small meal  But its food value is still very high if it is a vertebrate prey such as a rodent a bird or a fish 
The feeding of insect-eaters is less efficient  They must scoop up or snap up huge numbers of insects each day to fill their stomachs and each insect contains a large percentage of rather non-nutritious outer-covering 
The advantage however is that there are plenty of insects about  The second major category of feeders is the scavenger group 
These are the meat-eaters who leave the killing to someone else  The benefit of this feeding lifestyle is that it avoids the dangers of active killing of prey 
A carcass can not injure you  But the food is always of second-best quality the left-overs from the hunters 
And there is always a risk of disease to replace the risk of injury  It must be admitted however that vultures always appear remarkably healthy 
The raccoon has a strong preference for aquatic feeding  The development of its taste for small water creatures as a main ingredient in its omnivorous diet may be similar to the trend that occurred in our own ancient ancestors during the intermediate stage on the way to becoming the first hunting primates 
At the other end of the scale there are the particle feeders static animals such as burrowing marine worms and other bottom-dwelling aquatic creatures that simply sit and sift the plentiful detritus that sinks to the bed of seas and lakes  They rarely go hungry but they are easy prey for aquatic hunters having little or no mobility with which to defend themselves 
The diet of this Alaskan brown bear right is predominantly succulent vegetation including roots fruits and berries but when the opportunity arises animal foods are consumed with relish  Once a year the up-river migration of the salmon heading for their spawning grounds provides a great feast 
Each fish is caught in the water then carried to a nearby bank and delicately devoured  As a restaurant diner would the bear separates the flesh from the skeleton which is left behind after the meal 
Opposite top left River-feeding birds have evolved a highly specialised hunting technique based on great restraint  They have developed the ability to stand stock-still like statues until the fish are relaxed and unwary 
Then a lightning stab is made in which the bird has to allow for the refraction of the water surface  Herons are masters of this technique 
Similar to these are the filter-feeders animals that pass a current of water through their bodies and take out of it all the food they need  The largest of the filter-feeders is however far from static and is indeed the biggest animal that has ever lived the blue whale 
This vast creature weighing up to 30 tons feeds by merely swimming along with its mouth open  It collects its food on a curtain of baleen or whalebone in its mouth and after a single meal may well have transferred to its stomach no less than 2 tons of tiny shrimps each no more than 3 inches long 
The largest of the sharks and rays are also filter-feeders  Opposite top right The first mammals were small scurrying nocturnal creatures that hunted for insects and other small animals 
Today 's tarsiers retain this ancient feeding pattern  Birds of prey such as this tawny owl opposite bottom swooping down on a mouse are at serious risk in many parts of the world because of pesticides employed to eliminate the pests on which they rely for food 
Being highly specialised feeders there are no alternatives for them and their numbers are dwindling fast  Among the birds flamingos have also evolved strainers inside their mouths and operate as filter-feeders in shallow lakes 
They feed with their heads upside-down sweeping them from side to side  The tongue acts as a pump helping to suck in small forms of water-life and squeeze them down the throat 
Dabbling ducks operate a similar system when sifting through the muddy bottoms of the waters on which they live  With lower forms of life that employ this type of feeding system such as oysters and other bivalves the animals are usually stationary and pass the current of water through their bodies by beating with thousands of tiny filaments called cilia 
Many of these creatures peacock worms for instance look more like plants than animals  The world 's greatest scavengers are undoubtedly the vultures above 
They detect the presence of carrion by sight  Their excellent long-distance vision spots something suspicious and they fly to it at high speed 
Other vultures observe these rapid flying actions in the distance and then move in themselves  In this way a carcass can draw vultures from far away in a short time 
Once there they gorge themselves until they are so bloated they can hardly take off  On dry land the nearest equivalents of the filter-feeders are the grazers 
Like their aquatic counterparts they have to take in a great deal of substance to supply their energy needs  But instead of filtering food from huge quantities of water they have to extract it from a mass of indigestible vegetable matter 
Grazers have the enormous advantage that there is plenty of their favourite food available all around them stretching for as far as the eye can see and regrowing time and again regardless of how much they crop it  But they have the grave disadvantage that they must spend almost all their waking hours eating it if they are to obtain an adequate diet 
The endlessly repetitive cropping and grinding becomes a whole way of life dominating the daily routine of such animals as rabbits and hares some rodents marsupials such as kangaroos and wallabies many ungulates and among invertebrates the grasshoppers and locusts  Starfish above right are the vultures of the seabed 
Here a swarm of common starfish are rapidly devouring the carcass of a fish  Seeking more succulent vegetation many herbivores have turned their attention to higher sources of food in the shrubs and trees of woodlands and forests 
Antelopes such as the long-necked gerenuks the even longer-necked giraffes and pachyderms like the elephants and the black rhinos have all stretched upwards for their sustenance  Koalas sloths and leaf-eating monkeys are already up there with a never-ending supply of food at their disposal but again with the problem of breaking it down and digesting it 
For these browsers like grazers the feeding is easy but tedious putting a greater evolutionary pressure on patience rather than intelligence  For some reason however the pachyderms do not fit this picture both elephants and rhinos exhibit far more complex personalities with much higher intelligence than might be expected for animals with their style of feeding 
Hyenas have always been thought of as scavengers but it is now known that they are also vigorous nocturnal hunters  By day however they are more likely to move in on someone else 's kill and carry off parts that other jaws can not crack below 
There is another major category of feeders that concentrates more on the highly nutritious parts of plants their fruits nuts seeds and flowers  Those that are specialist fruit-eaters enjoy a much more luscious form of food rich in water carbohydrate Vitamin C and sometimes oil but poor in protein 
Most fruit-eaters require other kinds of food as supplements and they tend to be generally more omnivorous in their habits  Fruit is so tasty however so sweet and juicy that it is a favourite source of food for a huge variety of mammals birds and reptiles 
Together these species assist the plant kingdom in its dispersal and reproduction via the pips stones and seeds that are rejected or excreted  THE LINEAR IMPULSE

Alfred Watkins was hardly the sort of person one would expect to start a movement which would radically affect the way in which we experience the landscape  In fact he was the archetypal pillar of society flour-miller magistrate and county councillor 
Born in Hereford in 1855 he became known throughout his native county as he built up a detailed knowledge of the countryside of Herefordshire and the Welsh border  He was a pioneer photographer inventing and selling the first popular exposure meter and his natural empathy with the countryside is reflected in his photographs 
He was also a prominent member of the Woolhope Naturalists Field Club a well-respected society mainly devoted to the archaeology of Herefordshire  Throughout his life several elements had been working within him a deep knowledge and appreciation of the countryside a sharp mind and a willingness to learn 
On 30 June 1921 these elements coalesced and he suddenly saw that familiar landscape with new eyes  His son Allen recounts the discovery 
A chance visit to Blackwardine caused him to look at the map for features of interest  He had no particular object in mind but was just having a look around 
He noticed on the map a straight line that passed over hill tops through various points of interest and these points of interest were all ancient  Then without any warning it all happened suddenly 
His mind was flooded with a rush of images forming one coherent plan  The scales fell from his eyes and he saw that over many long years of prehistory all trackways were in straight lines marked out by experts on a sighting system 
The whole plan of The Old Straight Track stood suddenly revealed  A chance visit to Blackwardine caused him to look at the map for features of interest

The scales fell from his eyes and he saw that over many long years of prehistory all trackways were in straight lines marked out by experts on a sighting system  The whole plan of The Old Straight Track stood suddenly revealed 
Alfred Watkins 1855â€“1935  The discoverer of the Ley System 
Illustration by Nigel Pennick  Watkins concluded that these straight trackways which he came to believe had been known as leys had landmarks constructed along their route as a guide 
He described them vividly  imagine a fairy chain stretched from mountain peak to mountain peak as far as the eye could reach and paid out until it touched the high places of the earth at a number of ridges banks and knowls 
Then visualize a mound circular earthwork or clump of trees planted on these high points and in low points in the valley other mounds ringed round with water to be seen from a distance  Then great standing stones brought to mark the way at intervals and on a bank leading up to a mountain ridge or down to a ford the track cut deep so as to form a guiding notch on the skyline as you come up 
In a bwlch or mountain pass the road cut deeply at the highest place straight through the ridge to show as a notch afar off  Here and there and at two ends of the way a beacon fire used to lay out the track 
With ponds dug on the line or streams banked up into flashes to form reflecting points on the beacon track so that it might be checked when at least once a year the beacon was fired on the traditional day  All these works exactly on the sighting line 
The wayfarer 's instructions are still deeply rooted in the peasant mind to-day when he tells you quite wrongly now You just keep straight on  imagine a fairy chain stretched from mountain peak to mountain peak as far as the eye could reach and paid out until it touched the high places of the earth at a number of ridges banks and knowls

The wayfarer 's instructions are still deeply rooted in the peasant mind to-day when he tells you quite wrongly now You just keep straight on  But could such tracks have survived even as a remnant 
Untold acres are being buried under bricks and mortar and even in the countryside deep ploughing ripping out of hedgerows and widening of roads have seemingly obliterated most traces of the ancient landscape  There must have been a succession of road and track layouts over the years so it would be fortunate indeed if even part of the original network had survived 
Watkins fully appreciated this and it is significant that his original vision was of a series of markers stretched across the landscape rather than trackways as such  The idea of the continuity of sites over the generations is easier to accept for if markers of some sort had been laid down they might well have survived even if their form had changed over time 
He started to plot lines of ancient sites and quickly got a feel for those which cropped up most frequently  He began to realize from the nature of these sites how the leys could have been constructed 
It is actually a fairly simple matter well within the capability of Neolithic and Bronze Age people to set down a straight line across hilly country using three surveying poles  Watkins thought they were traders ' tracks laid out between terminal points often hilltops with intermediate waymarkers 
How the leys were laid out  From the cover of The Ley Hunter 's Manual by Alfred Watkins 1927 
An example is the Saintbury ley discovered by Devereux and Thomson  It is 3Â½ miles 5.8 km long and runs from the heights of the Cotswolds down to the Vale of Evesham 
The ley starts from a wayside cross next to a crossroads goes through Saintbury Church noted for its pagan survivals through a Bronze Age round barrow a Neolithic long barrow sited in the middle of an Iron Age fort through a Saxon pagan cemetery and an eighteenth-century beacon tower ending at an ancient farmstead Seven Wells which was the subject of a fictional book on witchcraft by Hugh Ross Williamson entitled The Silver Bowl  A strange mixture 
It is sometimes said that Watkins adopted such a variety of markers including features of all types and ages that his ideas can be discredited on this point alone  But by understanding how he saw leys being constructed and operating a picture begins to emerge of a system where each piece can be fitted into the whole 
Watkins believed that natural markers were used to set out the ley system  The most prominent of these were hilltops and he found that all leys had a hilltop for at least one of their terminal points 
Whilst the highest hill in an area would often be used it was more important that this should have a distinctive shape or be prominent in relation to the surrounding countryside  Many of these hills have become known as holy and were often beacon sites 
Watkins saw the origin of the beacon in the fires used to lay out the original alignments and Tony Wedd used to quote Newman 's hymn Lead kindly light as an unconscious memory of the process  Other natural sites acting as terminal points are prominent rock outcrops springs and holy wells 
Watkins also considered that stone circles and henges could act as terminal points  Markers the first of which were perhaps the surveying staffs themselves were put in place to guide travellers 
Joseph of Arimathea is reputed to have planted one at Wearyall Hill which subsequently sprouted into the Glastonbury Thorn  Certainly thorn trees occur along leys and planting is a way of establishing a mark with relatively little effort 
Ideally the marker trees would be of a species that was foreign to or rare in the area and easy to distinguish by form and size at all seasons  The Scots pine Pinus sylvestris which Watkins referred to as The Tree of the Ancient Track meets several of these criteria 
Although native to Scotland it is evergreen darker in appearance than most trees and tends to stand above the general canopy  Tony Wedd taught me to spot them as possible ley markers and the sight of a clump or an individual pine standing alone on a ridge still fills me with excitement perhaps a resonance with the ancient traveller to whom such a sight meant the security and guidance that the straight tracks provided 
Watkins admits that trees are a very weak point with the ley-hunter meaning of course that if leys are prehistoric any existing trees could not possibly be original  They would have to be their descendants by several generations 
It could happen  On the high points where the tree clumps are mostly situated conditions may well be specially favourable for regenerated trees to survive to full maturity thus helping to ensure the continuation of the position and form of the clump 
A further explanation can be found in the idea of tending that is just as work is needed to keep a garden in good heart so the clumps needed the active participation of local people to survive  Perhaps a nearby individual acted as guardian of the site and did whatever was necessary planting fertilizing weeding out weak specimens and keeping the clump within bounds 
It seems at least possible that such a network of guardians was still in place in Watkins ' time  I have certainly heard of it happening in the present day but the old methods are dying out as people become alienated from the countryside they live in 
Certainly many of the clumps are dying out  The impressive Cole 's Tump which Watkins photographed prominently silhouetted against the background of the Welsh mountains may not survive the end of the century 
This is verging on the tragic because even if there is only a remote chance of these clumps being survivors from prehistoric times it must be our duty to ensure their continuity  In upland areas significant markers could be made fairly easily with piles of stones 
These cairns as they are called can reach enormous proportions those on the tops of hills being capable in some instances of being seen for many miles  Travellers might gradually have helped to make the marker more obvious 
It seems to be a very deep-seated tradition the need to add another stone to an existing pile and many who climb hills today do so with a stone in their pocket to add to the cairn on the summit  Watkins also found much larger stones marking the leys particularly in valleys 
Typically these are unworked and are chosen for their distinctiveness  In East Yorkshire they are glacial erratics stones picked up in the last Ice Age worn smooth and deposited as the ice retreated 
They are often rounded but some have a flat top which was often placed so that the sharpest edge or point indicated the direction of the ley  Whilst they are heavy it would have been quite possible by co-operative effort to move them into the right position to mark the line 
Markstones can often be found on the roadside in a bank or beneath a hedge  Winter is the best time to see them as they can get quite overgrown in summer 
Watkins found them sited at intervals along a ley and often at the crossing of two leys  Markstones can still be seen at road junctions and crossroads 
A distinction needs to be drawn however with stones used to keep vehicles away from the corners of buildings  This is fairly easy in practice although some markstones because of their location perform this function as well 
The stones may have been the origin of market sites and have been the focus or ompholos around which market towns grew up  In Market Weighton East Yorkshire there is a markstone right in the middle of the town opposite the church and in Pembridge Herefordshire Watkins found a markstone next to the market house 
Markstones are particularly vulnerable  Highway engineers ' schemes for increasing the size of junctions often result in the stone being broken up for hardcore or being tossed unceremoniously aside 
At best it will be replaced by the new kerb but its essential quality its position will have been lost  They are also not usually recognized as having any significance by those responsible for statutory protection measures particularly if they are suspected of having any connection with leys or other lunatic fringe ideas 
Fortunately this is slowly changing  A new breed of archaeologist is emerging more open-minded and willing to see significance in the detail of the countryside which is slowly disappearing 
Local residents once given a hint can be useful allies in preserving these forgotten features of their heritage  In time more elaborate structures were built on the lines including mounds or tumuli of earth and stone burial chambers and dolmens or cromlechs 
Natural high points were emphasized by mounds often slightly off the hilltop so that they could be seen from the valley bottom  Watkins found many mounds in this position on Radnor Forest 
They were never larger than was necessary for them to be seen from the next point along the line but were higher than the tops of any forest trees in the vicinity  In low-lying land the ditch which often surrounded these mounds tended to fill with water and Watkins saw a progression to the circular moats which were common in his district 
Water is a key element in the ley system  It seemed to Watkins to have a role both in laying out the system and in guiding travellers 
Its significance was in its reflecting qualities  If a pond and beacon were both on the line you would only see the reflection of the beacon in the pond if you were on the line too 
More generally water will show up from a distance by catching and reflecting light from the sky  Ponds are the most obvious markers and we have the tradition particularly on the chalk downs and wolds of dewponds constructed with layers of organic and inorganic material to retain water even after a prolonged dry spell 
In some of the higher settlements the pond is still the centre of the village the church being more recent is relegated to the edge  Ashmore in Cranborne Chase is a classic example and there are many similar villages in the Yorkshire Wolds 
Leys can often be found passing through the pond and the church in a village and it is always worth trying this out where the pond seems ancient  Fords and bridge sites often change little over the years and Watkins cites several examples of leys crossing rivers at fords 
Hilltop earthworks somewhat misleadingly called camps or hill forts are often found to have their form determined by leys the straight sections of embankment being aligned on distant markers  Watkins found that the earthworks around Hereford such as Dinedor and Capler followed this pattern 
Today we are seeing a system in decay but surprisingly often we find stretches of road and track coinciding with the old alignments  Watkins found crossroads falling on leys with amazing frequency even though the present-day roads were not aligned on the leys 
It was the site which had remained unchanged  Crossroads have a special place in tradition 
Witches were supposed to meet there  Certainly those who had been accused of witchcraft or committed suicide could not be buried in the churchyard second best was usually the crossroads a memory perhaps of some measure of sanctity which may over time have become attached to leys because of their association with other sacred sites 
Evidence of trackways can still sometimes be found  Watkins particularly noted notches where the ley went over a hilltop 
These were a valuable indicator as they would only show up from a distance if you were on the line  Watkins ' inclusion of churches as mark points is particularly controversial these dated from Saxon times at the earliest whereas leys were claimed to be prehistoric 
This objection could be countered by examples of churches known to have been built on pagan sites such as Cascob Radnorshire and Fimber East Yorkshire which were actually built on tumuli  Also in East Yorkshire are Goodmanham which was built on the site of a pagan temple and Rudston where the church is adjacent to the tallest standing stone in Britain 
The process was set out clearly in a letter from Pope Gregory to Bishop Mellitus in CE601  I have come to the conclusion that the temples of the idols in England should not on any account be destroyed 
Augustine must smash the idols but the temples themselves should be sprinkled with holy water and altars set up in them in which relics are to be enclosed  I hope the people seeing their temples are not destroyed will leave their idolatry and yet continue to frequent the places as formerly so coming to know and revere the true God 
I have come to the conclusion that the temples of the idols in England should not on any account be destroyed  Augustine must smash the idols but the temples themselves should be sprinkled with holy water and altars set up in them in which relics are to be enclosed 
I hope the people seeing their temples are not destroyed will leave their idolatry and yet continue to frequent the places as formerly so coming to know and revere the true God  So the Church took over the sites and in some cases the very buildings where the pagan gods and goddesses were worshipped 
This process of Christianization was slow the people clung to their pagan beliefs and saw no difficulty in combining the two faiths  The study of pagan survivals in English churches is fascinating and writers such as Guy Ragland Phillips have shown that churches are still full of pagan symbolism 
Churchyard and wayside crosses are often the result of a similar process  Standing stones particularly in Devon and Cornwall were Christianized with a carved cross and cross bases were made from large stones like markstones with sockets cut into their tops 
Even if they were first established in prehistoric times knowledge use and even construction of leys may have continued well into the medieval period perhaps as the secret inheritance of certain esoteric orders  Particularly in the older towns and cities such as London Bristol and Cambridge there is evidence that churches were built on leys 
Brian Larkman has discovered what he calls the Corridor of Sanctity in York leading from the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss through the site of a Templar chapel the massive Clifford 's Tower and five other medieval churches including the Minster  Certainly the mark points survived while the old straight tracks fell into disuse and neglect 
New structures often replaced the old on the same site  As well as churches Watkins quotes numerous examples of castle mounds which developed from earlier structures 
Surprisingly frequently leys also pass exactly through important and isolated farmsteads often on a similar orientation to the main buildings  There is a ley which runs east from the Yorkshire village of Sproatley to the coast 
It goes through four churches a stone and a moat as well as being followed by a road for much of its length  In the village of Humbleton as well as passing through the church the ley runs through the two major farmsteads in the village the Manor House and Humbleton Hall both of which have buildings aligned on the ley 
Place names may provide a clue when the physical marks have gone  As an example Tony Wedd quotes One Tree Hill where a ley crosses the Greensand Ridge in Kent 
The hilltop is now completely wooded over but the name remains as witness to a possible mark  Place names change over the years in some cases quite substantially and Watkins warned against too easy an acceptance of a name at face value 
The most obvious is the word ley  Whilst he considered that the old straight tracks had actually been called leys Watkins did not disagree with the orthodox interpretation of this element as pasture or field 
However he thought that this meaning had evolved from the original word for a straight track via the clearing of the woodland through which it passed to the more common present-day meaning  He quotes examples such as Ley Rock near Tintagel and Bonsall Leys high up on the Derbyshire moors to demonstrate that the word did not always refer to pasture 
Watkins also gives meanings for the obsolete word leye as firstly an island and secondly flame blaze or fire both as we have seen relating to the laying out of the old straight track  He considered that the expression the lay of the land was an unconscious memory of the original use of the word 
There is also confirmation in the word laia meaning a roadway in a wood and the French words layon meaning a track used by sportsmen and laie meaning a bridleway or forest ride  Watkins ceased to use the word ley towards the end of his life and caution should be exercised in using the element as evidence of an old straight track 
In his researches Watkins found the elements cole dod red white and black indicative of a trackway  He thought cole and black referred to charcoal and to its use for the marker beacons 
Red and white referred to traders ' tracks specializing in pottery and salt respectively  Dod he speculated could have been the name for the original surveyors dodging about 
How do we go about finding leys  We do n't all have Watkins ' advantages a lifetime 's familiarity and sympathy with his native countryside the photographer 's eye for detail for the unusual and for the properly framed view and the advantage of access to the countryside as part of his daily work 
We must start from where we are as urbanized humanity  Even if we live in the countryside we are likely to be alienated from the land and so must create the link afresh 
For this we need the three resources of mapwork fieldwork and archive work blended with intuition  Ordnance Survey maps are essential they are accurate and of good quality 
The 1:50,000 series is the most useful scale to start with  Any likely leys can then be checked on the 1:25,000 maps 
Get flat maps for preference as folds can distort the line somewhat  For the most detail the first editions of the old 6-inch maps are invaluable 
These can probably be consulted at your nearest local history library  The newer 1:10,000 maps do n't have nearly as much detail 
This is partly due to a real loss of features in the countryside as a result of modern agricultural practices and partly due to the present policy of the Ordnance Survey  So get the local sheet of the 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey and lay it out on the table 
Think about the mark points that are most likely to be indicated on the map village churches tumuli and castle mounds stone circles and standing stones wayside crosses and beacon sites  Just play around with the map for a while together with a sharp pencil and a long transparent ruler 
Let intuition take over and see whether you can find some promising lines passing through several of these points  If you find a likely line see if there is confirmation by way of stretches of road following the line road junctions crossroads or fords falling on it or some of the place name elements Watkins referred to 
You will probably get some sort of feeling when you are on the right track  This is only the start however as many potential mark points wo n't appear on the map at some stage you have to follow up with fieldwork 
A ley can really only be said to be confirmed if it has been walked for most of its length  Sometimes this is n't possible as care has to be taken to keep to public footpaths or ask landowners ' permission 
For those with other means of transport a possible procedure is to follow the line as closely as possible by public roads stopping where the line crosses to observe and explore  In particular the high and low points on the line should be noted and investigated for possible sighting markers 
Draw a cross-section along the line by noting where the contours cross and gradually build up a profile of the ley on a separate piece of paper  The visibility of one point from another can then be determined and the likely sighting spots found 
Tony Wedd gave the example of an alignment of Scots pine clumps in Kent between Lyewood Common and Kent Hatch  There were four clumps accurately aligned and each was on a high point on the line sited for maximum visibility 
In fieldwork you are really looking for anything that might confirm the existence of a ley  Markstones buried in a hedge bottom or by the side of the road tree clumps on prominent sites that can be seen from a distance earthworks that might be indicative of an old sunken way or indeed anything unusual on the line 
It is surprising how often field gates for example are exactly on a ley  Local residents can be helpful as Allen Watkins found on his first ley walk 
Unprompted a farm labourer told him of the tradition of an old track precisely on the line where he had surmised the ley to be  You will quickly pick up the feel of a ley and know when you are exactly on it 
This may be something intuitive but it is also a matter of visual rightness  Watkins always said that the best photographs are taken along the ley 
Certainly a picture often seems to be framed perfectly in such cases  Incidentally it is a good idea to take photographs where possible as sites are still disappearing at a rapid rate 
Winter is a good time for fieldwork  Not only will markstones show up more easily when undergrowth has died down but earthworks can be seen more readily in the low-angle winter sun 
There are many clues hidden amongst the archives of the local library or museum  The old Victorian antiquarians often observed much that would nowadays be ignored 
The Transactions of the local Archaeological Antiquarian or Historical Society or specialist local histories often refer to features in the landscape such as stones or holy wells which have since vanished or been forgotten about  There may be folklore or legends attached to sites which should always be recorded 
The County Sites and Monuments Records now likely to be on computer give details of all archaeological sites  Aerial photographs can be another valuable source of information 
When you have researched a ley by map field and archive you are then in a position to write up the material for possible publication in a magazine such as The Ley Hunter  Articles on well-documented leys are usually welcomed 
A list of the current magazines in the field is given on p. 122  In time you will begin to build up quite a body of knowledge on the ley system in your area and may start to host trips for your local Earth Mysteries group 
Certainly at the very least the quest for leys adds interest to visits to the countryside  What I have called the linear impulse seems to be found in widely distant parts of the world 
Paul Devereux has called it a primary experience something deeply seated in the human psyche  This was not the opinion of the archaeologists who attacked Watkins ' ideas following publication of The Old Straight Track in 1925 
O.G.S. Crawford refused a paid advertisement for the book in the journal Antiquity his objection centring around the view that prehistoric people did not walk in straight lines as all the undoubted prehistoric roads were winding  Such criticism was premature as it is now clear that in many parts of the world long dead-straight trackways were laid out and in several cases are still used 
Watkins knew of the Chin tracks in India which follow the most direct line between villages regardless of gradient the straight camel tracks of Palestine sighted on tree clumps on ridges notched where the line went through and the skyline cairns of Egypt set up as landmarks for caravans  He quotes from Johnston 's Uganda 
The broad native roads made as straight as possible for their mark like the roads of the Romans seem to pick out preferentially the highest and steepest hills which they ascend perpendicularly and without compromise  The broad native roads made as straight as possible for their mark like the roads of the Romans seem to pick out preferentially the highest and steepest hills which they ascend perpendicularly and without compromise 
It is in the American continent however that the most complete evidence is to be found  Watkins wrote of the Cree Indian tracks always being straight and recent findings in Chaco Canyon New Mexico confirm the existence of long straight tracks laid down by the Anasazi 
Though not tracks the lines of Nazca in Peru are strikingly similar  They were noticed in 1926 but only following aerial photography in the 1930s was their extent recognized 
Situated on a plateau between the coast and the mountains straight lines geometrical figures trapezoids and shapes of animals are outlined on the desert surface made by scraping away the darker top layer to reveal a lighter layer underneath  Lack of rainfall means that they have survived intact for hundreds of years though they are now being threatened by tourists 
Higher up in the mountains is the system of ceques centred on the old Inca capital of Cuzco  Radiating out from the Temple of the Sun where the Inca presided were the ceques or alignments of shrine sites known as huacas 
Many are stones or springs others bridges or gullies  Some have been Christianized others destroyed or their use changed 
Enough of these huacas remain however for the biologist Tony Morrison to have plotted several ceques and recorded them by infra-red photography as narrow lines in the vegetation  Morrison found more evidence of the linear impulse in Bolivia 
Straight tracks up to fifty miles 80 km in length often aligned to a mountain top were still in use by local inhabitants  They were marked by piles of stones particularly at intersections and churches were frequently found on them 
Sacrifices and offerings are still made at sites along the lines and festivals take place on them  Morrison 's aerial photographs show narrow paths going straight across miles of rugged countryside 
On the face of it leys are ideally suited to a statistical approach  You have a number of points on a map some are aligned 
What is the likelihood that such alignments would occur through chance alone  Yet as we look closer the difficulties multiply 
The essence of the problem is to define a ley which is harder than it appears  What markers are we going to accept for example and how can we define them with precision 
Do we have enough information over say a single map sheet to be able to plot all the potential ley markers including those that are not on the map  How accurately do the points have to be aligned before we accept them as a ley 
None of these questions yet has a satisfactory answer  Watkins himself was the first to attempt some sort of statistical assessment 
He took the One inch to One mile Ordnance Survey sheet for the Andover area noting that there were fifty-one churches on the map  Plotting alignments he found eight cases of four churches aligning and one example of a five-church line 
As a comparison he took a similar-sized piece of paper and marked fifty-one crosses at random  He found only one instance of four points aligning and none of five 
The number of three-point alignments was much the same in each case  His conclusion was that four-point alignment was strong evidence of design rather than accident 
This is essentially what more recent statisticians are trying to do to compare actual alignments with those obtained by random methods  The difficulty was always to obtain sufficiently high-quality data within a defined area 
In 1974 John Michell produced a detailed study of alignments in West Penwith Cornwall supported by extensive fieldwork  It is the best area in Britain for megalithic sites and is surrounded on three sides by the sea 
Michell 's work provided the opportunity researchers had been waiting for and Pat Gadsby and Chris Hutton-Squire of the alternative technology magazine Undercurrents took up the challenge  For the first time a computer was used in the analysis 
The positions of the fifty-three sites mentioned by Michell were plotted  Alignments between these points were found by computer 
Random number tables were then used to generate a set of fifty-three imaginary references  Each point was nudged randomly within its own grid square so that the overall clustering was retained but any alignments destroyed 
The analysis was then repeated with the simulated data  The results of the computer run using the real sites showed a five-point alignment which would be expected by chance only once in 250 runs 
There were also five four-point alignments where less than one would be expected  The odds against getting the fifty-one three-point alignments obtained are 160 to 1 
The study has been criticized for incompleteness of data but it was a major step forward and the results obtained were so positive that further research was stimulated  Robert Forrest and Michael Behrend are currently in the forefront of statistical ley research 
They have gradually refined their techniques over the years with additional factors such as ley length continually being built in to the equation  The best leys such as the alignment of the Devil 's Arrows standing stones in Yorkshire with the Thornborough Henges pass their tests well but the statistical models used are still not entirely adequate to cope fully with the real distribution of sites in the landscape 
There can however be no doubt about the way in which Watkins ' discovery caught the public imagination  Why this sometimes happens is difficult to understand 
Perhaps it is all a question of timing and that summer afternoon in 1921 was the moment when the linear impulse started its break through to public awareness  For Alfred Watkins it was not a sudden flash of inspiration from the beyond but something which had been building up within the deeper levels of his being throughout a lifetime of contact with his native countryside 
Certainly he was not the first to have been struck by the idea and in his first book on leys he quotes a reference from 1882 in which G.H. Piper notes an alignment of several sites in Herefordshire  In 1870 when Watkins was fifteen years old the British Archaeological Association held its annual Congress in his native Hereford 
One of the speakers was William Henry Black a historiographer at the Public Record Office in London  He had been working since the 1820s on his theory that grand geometrical lines had been laid out in ancient times across the country and that these were indicated by old boundaries and markers 
Watkins probably heard mention of these ideas the seeds from which may have lain dormant in him for over fifty years  Archive investigations by Nigel Pennick and others have revealed numerous examples from Victorian times onwards of work on the alignment of ancient sites 
One of the earliest was the Reverend Edward Duke who in the 1840s found that several prehistoric sites including Avebury Silbury Hill and Stonehenge were aligned north-south with each other  He went further and tied the distances between the sites in with the known distances between planets in the solar system 
By the turn of the century alignment research was on the increase although it was being carried on by individuals working in isolation from each other  C.W. Dymond was plotting alignments at the Stanton Drew stone circle in Somerset 
As early as 1889 Joseph Houghton Spencer plotted lines through churches barrows beacon sites and fragments of path considering them to be remnants of a system of ancient signal stations  And Francis J. Bennett was investigating a parallel system of meridional north south lines in Kent on which both megalithic sites and churches fell 
Following extensive researches into the orientation of Egyptian temples the eminent astronomer Norman Lockyer turned his attention in 1901 to Stonehenge  He extended the midsummer sunrise line in both directions to pass through the top of Sidbury Hill to the north-east and touch the earthworks of Grovely Castle and Castle Ditches in the other direction 
He also found an alignment discovered independently by Watkins linking Stonehenge Old Sarum the old site of Salisbury Salisbury Cathedral and Clearbury Ring earthworks  Lockyer 's ideas were taken up in Germany by researchers such as Albrecht and Leugering the latter of whom in the 1920s found alignments in his native Westphalia 
He was helped by Josef Heinsch who found further alignments particularly some oriented six degrees north or south of due east which he called a solar year line linking a holy hill in the west dedicated to the moon with a solar site in the east  Germany in the 1920s and 30s was fertile ground for such ideas 
Any work which demonstrated ancient Germanic culture was seized upon and given official patronage  A notable beneficiary of this was Wilhelm Teudt 1860â€“1942 
Independently of Albrecht and Heinsch he found a network of holy lines oriented on astronomical phenomena  Along these lines were beacons and watchtowers and he found that from any earthwork there would be an orientation marker in the form of a watchtower along north-south or east-west axes 
All the elements which were to appear in Watkins ' ley thesis and others were present in these earlier and contemporary researches remains of old straight tracks churches on older pagan sites beacons meridional lines and astronomical orientation  Only now is this work being rediscovered reassessed and integrated into the mainstream of ley research which started with Watkins 
It was through Watkins that interest and ideas about the linear impulse burgeoned  Following his initial vision Watkins worked quickly and with enthusiasm fuelled by the stored experiences of over fifty years 
As he put it  half the year had gone the clear smoke-free distances of early summer a thing of the past and midsummer day over before I got the first clue 
Once started I found no halt in the sequence of new facts revealed by active search on the tracks  half the year had gone the clear smoke-free distances of early summer a thing of the past and midsummer day over before I got the first clue 
Once started I found no halt in the sequence of new facts revealed by active search on the tracks  He gave a lecture to the Woolhope Club in September 1921 illustrated with his own lantern slides 
There was encouragement for the lecture to be published and the following year an edited transcript appeared accompanied by selected photographs  Meanwhile Watkins continued his researches with increased vigour and three years later in 1925 his magnum opus The Old Straight Track was published 
Readers started to send him examples of leys in their own districts and as a result of their enthusiasm the Straight Track Club was formed in 1926  Members corresponded by means of postal portfolios whereby papers were circulated each member adding their own contribution as the package went round 
The club had field meetings following leys and visiting ancient sites a member who knew the area acting as leader  Members came from a variety of backgrounds many as knowledgeable about their own regions as Watkins was about his 
The portfolios are now in Hereford Central Library  They include several volumes of maps photographs accounts of leys theories and confirmation from various sources 
They reveal the lively interchange of ideas that took place including the expansion and development of Watkins ' original work  Major F.C 
Tyler a leading member of the club was instrumental in this  He had become increasingly unhappy about the trackway theory feeling it to be insufficient to account for the number of leys which seemed to exist the tendency for parallel systems the intersection of many leys at a single site and the phenomenon which he discovered of patterns of concentric circles 
Tyler felt that the only explanation was that the sites were all points in some widespread pattern that there was a sanctity to the sites and that this was the reason that they were marked in ancient times  His book The Geometrical Arrangement of Ancient Sites appeared in 1939 
In the 1930s Donald Maxwell produced a series of guide books which introduced ley-hunting to a much wider audience until it became in the words of The Birmingham Post a new outdoor hobby  The Straight Track Club was wound up in 1948 but ideas were kept alive through Egerton Sykes ' Avalon Society 
He published a paper by ex-sapper Kenneth Koop in which a case is made for the alignments being the remains of an early survey of Britain  Current interest in leys really dates from 1961 when ex-RAF pilot Tony Wedd published a small booklet entitled Skyways and Landmarks which postulated a link between UFO sightings and mark points on the ground 
I met him one spring day thirty years ago in the beautiful Kentish countryside where he lived  He was a free-thinker one whose thoughts ranged widely over every unorthodox idea forging connections where none had previously been contemplated 
From him I heard of leys for the first time and learned that he had found alignments of tree clumps in the countryside around his home  I was fired with his enthusiasm and on my reluctant return home ordered The Old Straight Track from the library 
From this I learned more about leys and immediately got out the local map to try and find one for myself  I succeeded almost immediately and found a good alignment of moats ending at Gill 's Lap pine clump on Ashdown Forest one of the marks noted by Tony Wedd 
A schoolfriend Jimmy Goddard was similarly inspired and together we formed The Ley Hunters Club  With the help of Tony Wedd and Egerton Sykes I tried to contact surviving members of the Straight Track Club 
Many of my envelopes came back Return to Sender and it was clear that most members had died or were very elderly  Several did respond however and I fondly remember visiting such people as Joan Hatton Christine Crosland-Symms Charles Mayo and Harold Fletcher Trew in their own homes 
They were all very heartened that someone was at last taking an interest I only wish I had had a tape recorder  Allen Watkins agreed to be President of the club and spoke at its inaugural meeting in November 1962 the same day as the founding of the Findhorn Community in Scotland such are the synchronicities of the universe 
He talked of his father 's psychic abilities and also of the way in which Alfred Watkins had come to see the ley mark points in terms of the old elements fire earth air and water  He believed that they could so perfectly fit this classification that one of the functions of leys was for ritual or teaching purposes 
We started a small newsletter to which in 1965 we gave the title The Ley Hunter it is still flourishing over a quarter of a century later  Jimmy gave a series of talks including one which was attended by John Michell and Paul Devereux 
He started their interest in the subject and they have since become prominent in the field  Many others were brought into the subject during the 1960s including Anthony Roberts Nigel Pennick and Paul Screeton 
The subject also expanded greatly in scope from that of the study of leys and one theme which began to be explored was that of folklore  A wealth of legends and folk tales has been recorded much of which relates to particular sites in the countryside 
What excited many of those who were following leys was the realization that the legends were about the very same sites which Watkins had found to be ley markers  This line of inquiry proved to be a rewarding path which was however to lead in a most unexpected direction 
Only in the last hundred years have most people in the developed world been able to read and write  Before that time knowledge and wisdom were passed on through the spoken word as they still are in much of the world 
This is the essence of folklore much of which consists of stories and legends about sites both natural and artificial in the countryside  The eighteenth-century antiquarians started to collect tales they heard 
Oral tradition was written down and gained a wider currency than ever before  Publication was stimulated by the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century revival of interest in folk customs and accounts from many places throughout the British Isles and beyond are to be found in published collections often by county 
They show an enormous variety within which certain common themes can be noticed  Many legends are attached to natural features in the landscape such as prominent hills rocks and springs others to some of the most ancient surviving artificial structures such as standing stones stone circles and barrows churches and wayside crosses 
The parallel with Watkins ' mark points was too striking to ignore and attracted attention from those who felt that folklore might provide a clue to understanding leys  But what is folklore 
Is it just a collection of stories or does it contain memories of real experiences  And how old is it 
Some may be relatively recent like urban belief tales but others are much more ancient altered so that we no longer have any idea of their origin  The point about folklore is that it has to be interpreted 
The tales must have changed significantly over the generations  Allen Watkins used to say that there was a core of truth hidden in the heart of all folk tales and legends if we can only find it amongst the accumulations which have occurred over time the difficulty arose in finding out what it was of winnowing the wheat from the chaff 
One of the principles underlying Earth Mysteries is that unusual things do happen at certain places in the countryside  Folklore can be seen at least in part as the distorted memory of such events and experiences 
These are still occurring and ultimately there is no clear distinction between folk tales of unknown origin and accounts of events which have taken place within living memory  Any difference is one of degree rather than kind 
In the 1970s there was a renewed interest in site-related folklore  Two books Folklore of Prehistoric Sites in Britain by Leslie Grinsell and The Secret Country by Janet and Colin Bord appeared in 1976 and have been essential in preparing this chapter 
They both limit their coverage to Britain and this has influenced my own selection of examples similar themes to those discussed do occur in other parts of the world  Of all the types of site which have folklore attached to them stones both natural outcrops and deliberately placed structures are preeminent 
The legends are consistent in widely separate places and give a good cross-section of the main themes  So what legendary properties did the stones possess 
A surprising number have tales which suggest some form of activity almost as if they were alive a strange thing on the surface as stones are the archetype of solid unmoving form  Whilst I know of no specific legend attached to them the Tingle Stone and the Twizzle Stone both in Gloucestershire are very suggestive of just the sort of effects which have been reported at standing stones in recent years 
The first time I visited the Hart Stone in County Durham with Paul Screeton in 1969 for example I experienced strong tingling and Paul has recounted cases where the stone appeared to have healing properties  There is a whole group of stories of which Grinsell notes thirty-nine which involve the movement of stones 
I first heard of this when camping at the foot of Bredon Hill in Worcestershire in 1960  At the very top of the hill is a natural outcrop known as the Banbury Stone 
Local legend states that when it hears the church clock strike twelve it goes down to the River Avon to drink  This is but one variation on a theme other legends state that the relevant time is midnight cock crow sunrise or noon 
Some specify particular times of year such as New Year Easter Sunday morning Midsummer or All Hallows Eve  The stones are sometimes said to turn round or dance before going down to the local stream or lake to drink 
Natural outcrops standing stones and stone circles are all involved in the activity  According to legend some stones have moved permanently by their own power such as the Wergin Stone near Hereford which suddenly moved 240 paces and required nine yoke of oxen to take it back 
Others such as the Hoar Stone at Enstone Oxfordshire will go back to their original position if moved  The Blaxhall Stone in Suffolk is reputed to have grown from the size of a loaf to a block of five tons in a century and Drewton Pillar in East Yorkshire was believed to grow again when fragments fell from it 
A common belief was the impossibility of counting the stones of a stone circle  The Countless Stones at Aylesford in Kent are the remains of a chambered tomb a baker is said to have tried to solve the problem by placing a loaf on each stone but the Devil kept knocking them off 
The same legend may have attached itself to tree clumps as well  A.A. Milne refers to the clump at Gills Lap as being enchanted because no one had been able to count the number of trees even by tying string round each trunk as it was counted 
As mentioned above stones traditionally have healing properties  The Cornish holed stone Men-an-Tol is reputed to cure a variety of afflictions particularly of a rheumatic nature 
Children with rickets were passed naked through the hole three times and then drawn along the grass three times in an easterly direction  Adults had to crawl nine times through the hole against the sun 
Physical contact was often thought necessary  Canna 's Stone at Llangan in Carmarthenshire was said to cure ague 
The sufferer was to sit and preferably sleep on the stone after partaking of the waters from a nearby well  Along with healing stones were thought to bestow fertility 
The Tolven Stone in Cornwall ensured fertility in a person if he or she crawled naked through the hole in it  Other stones would ensure an engagement the success of a marriage or the easing of childbirth 
Women who desired children would visit the King Stone Warwickshire at full moon and rub their breasts on its surface  A tale which seems linked with fertility is that of the White Cow of Mitchell 's Fold a stone circle in Shropshire 
A white cow used to provide milk for everyone in the locality but it was customary for only one pailful to he taken  There arrived one of evil life who milked the cow into a sieve until it was milked dry 
The cow disappeared and never returned and the evil one was turned into the tallest stone in the circle  There is a strong tradition that it is bad luck to disturb a standing stone or stone circle and fear of retribution has undoubtedly helped preserve many that might otherwise have been removed for building stone gateposts and the like 
Illness or disease could result from ignoring such strictures and cattle could become ill if stones from an ancient site were incorporated into the walls of their shelter  The sudden onset of severe weather conditions was thought to be a frequent result of disturbance to a site 
At Burley Camp in Devon a crock of gold is said to be buried but anyone who tries to dig for it is said to be scared away by thunder and lightning  Lewis Edwards tells of someone who wanted to break up the Hobgoblin Stone Carreg-y-Bucci in Wales for gateposts 
He was told No sooner had I got out my tools than there was a violent thunderstorm the worst I have ever known  I ran for my life but it followed me all the way home 
More positively veneration was shown by leaving offerings  At midnight on a full moon maidens used to leave cakes of barley-meal honey and milk on Arthur 's Stone Gower 
They then crawled round the stone three times on hands and knees hoping to see their future sweethearts  The tradition that stone circles and standing stones are human beings who have been turned to stone because of some misdemeanour is widespread and seems to point to some memory of the ritual use of these sites in ancient times 
Grinsell notes this tradition associated with more than a dozen stone circles from Cornwall to Scotland  Chris Castle notes that a stone circle in the Senegambian area of West Africa is popularly supposed to be a bridal party turned to stone 
The actions responsible for this misfortune vary from dancing on the Sabbath dancing through the night until sunrise refusing to accept Christianity and peering uninvited at festivities  The stones at the Merry Maidens stone circle in Cornwall are said to be musicians who accelerated their pace until they became petrified with exhaustion 
It is interesting that certain numbers seem to occur frequently in folklore particularly three seven and nine  There are several circles called Nine Maidens or Nine Stones which actually possess considerably more than nine stones 
Actions associated with sites such as running round a stone usually have to be done three or nine times  Other sites than stones such as barrows and holy wells are also the subject of folklore 
One of the most striking and common is the church that moved by night legend which occurs throughout Britain  At Holme-on-Spalding-Moor in East Yorkshire the church is sited at the top of a prominent hill and the village nestles at the bottom 
The legend goes that the first church was started at the bottom of the hill but during the night the walls were thrown down  This continued until it was realized that the fairies objected to the site and the church was then built on top of the hill which satisfied the fairies 
Ancient sites have traditionally been recognized as the haunts of beings or entities from worlds other than the everyday  Ghosts fairies dragons giants the devil and visitors from space have all been brought in at one time or another 
These stories occur world wide so I will limit myself to two which are told of sites on the Yorkshire Wolds only a few miles from where I live  William of Newburgh who lived in the twelfth century records a folktale about the large Neolithic round barrow known as Willy Howe 
A countryman was returning home late at night rather drunk  From the mound he heard voices of people singing as if at a banquet 
He went to investigate and seeing an open door in the side of the mound looked inside and saw men and women preparing for a ceremonial meal  One of the attendants offered him a cup he did not drink from this but threw out the contents and ran off with it 
He was pursued but escaped  The goblet was of unknown material unusual colour and of unfamiliar shape it was presented to the King 
John Nicholson records the following tale of a site only a few miles from Willy Howe  About half way down the hill forming the eastern slope of Nafferton Slack by the road-side to prevent waggons leaving the roadway stood a large stone which was believed to have wonderful powers 
At night at certain seasons it glowed like fire sometimes it seemed but the portal of a well-lighted hall and one old stone-breaker declared he had heard wonderful music issuing therefrom the like of which he had never heard before while on one occasion he had seen troops of gaily-dressed elfins repairing thither some on foot and some in carriages and they all went into this mysterious hall  About half way down the hill forming the eastern slope of Nafferton Slack by the road-side to prevent waggons leaving the roadway stood a large stone which was believed to have wonderful powers 
At night at certain seasons it glowed like fire sometimes it seemed but the portal of a well-lighted hall and one old stone-breaker declared he had heard wonderful music issuing therefrom the like of which he had never heard before while on one occasion he had seen troops of gaily-dressed elfins repairing thither some on foot and some in carriages and they all went into this mysterious hall  There are several different theories about fairies 
In one guise they are the descendants of an earlier race inhabiting these islands the little people who retain their pagan faith and haunts such as remote barrows and stones  Ancient peoples and those living in country districts must have been more sensitive to nature spirits or the entities underlying physical form 
These can manifest through interaction with the observer in a form acceptable to that observer hence local variants such as boggarts in my own area or traditional fairies with wings  I shall look into the processes involved in a later chapter 
According to tradition many sites both natural and artificial were formed by giants or the devil  A typical legend is that attached to the Hole of Horcum a great natural hollow and Blakey Topping a prominent cone-shaped hill both in the Yorkshire Moors 
The devil or alternatively the giant Wade is supposed to have scooped out the hole during a quarrel with a neighbour and thrown it at his adversary  As the earth and stones landed they formed Blakey Topping 
Major earthworks are often said to have been formed by the devil and standing stones to have been thrown by him a famous example being the Devil 's Arrows near Boroughbridge in Yorkshire  The anthropologist Margaret Murray used to say that the god of one religion becomes the devil of the next and these legends may be a way of indicating that the sites to which they were attached had been sacred in pre-Christian times 
Many places known to have links with the old religion have devil names such as the rock outcrop called the Devil 's Pulpit at Tealby Lincolnshire  There are legends of dragons throughout Britain 
A typical one is the dragon of Nunnington in Yorkshire  The hero a knight named Peter Loschy went to do battle with the dragon 
He managed to sever segments of the dragon 's body which his dog took away in its mouth  The head was poisonous however and the dog died as a result but not before having licked his master who thus also fell dead 
This story has many of the motifs common to dragon legends  Dragons were powerful with poisonous breath 
They often fought each other and attacked humans until slain by a brave hero frequently at an ancient site  They often coiled themselves round hills 
That China also had dragons is interesting  The Chinese approach to landscape including the forces underlying their concept of dragons will be examined in the next chapter which may enable parallels to be drawn with British examples 
I started by postulating that there was a grain of truth in all folklore and legend  Having looked at some of the main elements of folklore as they relate to sites in the landscape the question must now be asked what does it all mean 
Let us take a quick look again at what has emerged  Any disturbance to the stones may have a direct and dramatic effect on the weather 
On occasions stones appear to glow and strange sounds emerge  Loss of balance dizziness and tingling can result from close contact with the stones but this can also have a positive effect on the health and fertility of people brought into such contact 
These phenomena are associated with key points in the yearly monthly and daily cycle such as Midsummer full moon and midnight  The stone circles appear to have had some sort of tradition of dancing perhaps associated with these key times 
The view that has found favour amongst those involved with Earth Mysteries and one which seems to spring out of the page when these legends are brought together is that most folklore associated with ancient sites can best be interpreted in terms of the survival of the old pagan religion and one of its wellsprings the existence of some form of energy which the ancient people were sensitive to and which they used for healing and in their rituals  It is fair to say that this view is controversial certainly Grinsell remains strictly factual but the Bords support this explanation and in so doing follow in the footsteps of John Michell Tony Wedd and earlier writers of the 1930s 
It may not be a correct interpretation but a better one has not been put forward  Undoubtedly it does form an integrated web of ideas and whether right or not provides a framework within which folklore and legends can be assessed 
So looking again at these legends with a possible energy explanation in mind we can postulate that in the case of healing it is the energy which heals particularly with repeated movement in one direction and prolonged contact  The legend of the White Cow of Mitchell 's Fold indicates that the energy is not inexhaustible but could be permanently depleted if used unwisely 
Legends about the movement of stones arise because if the stones are alive with energy this in some way affects our perception so that we feel they are moving  The same applies to tales of the stones turning round rocking dancing and promoting dizziness 
Legends about stones glowing tingling and emanating music and sound can also clearly be fitted into an energy theory  Similarly the energy at sites may interact with certain individuals to create altered states of consciousness which enables them to see more easily the variety of legendary entities which traditionally inhabit such locations 
The importance of certain times of the day month or year suggests that the energy fluctuates according to cosmic cycles and the rituals followed this  It seems from folklore that these involved dancing with music through the night often on the Sabbath and the legends about being turned to stone imply disapproval of the old pagan religion which kept up these practices 
In all these accounts what emerges is that at some time in the past people were aware of energy at ancient sites  This awareness goes back a long time and to Lace it we need to leave the field of folklore and go back into the realms of ancient philosophy 
The evidence from folklore that some form of energy is associated with ancient sites in general and stones in particular was the starting point for a research effort initiated in 1977 by Paul Devereux editor of The Ley Hunter  This was known as The Dragon Project which he describes as a non-intrusive multi-disciplinary and multi-mode way of trying to understand the enigmatic stone monuments of prehistory 
Part of the programme involved monitoring known physical energies at the Rollright stone circle in Oxfordshire including ultrasound radiation magnetism and radio emissions  Resources were limited and any conclusions must be tentative but there was evidence of cyclical variations in the energies being monitored and on a significant number of occasions the values detected inside and outside the circle differed dramatically 
The story is told in more detail in Chapter 5  A parallel project personally undertaken by Devereux has been the investigation of what he has called earth lights 
These are light phenomena produced from the body of the Earth particularly in areas of faulted geology on mountain peaks and ridges bodies of water and areas of mineral deposits  They are difficult to explain within the laws of electromagnetism 
He considers that many occurrences of phenomena to which we give diverse names like UFOs ghosts will-o-the-wisps and apparitions of various sorts may all be manifestations of earth lights  Some areas have persistent earth light phenomena such as Marfa in south-west Texas 
The first written account dates from 1883  White yellowish and orange lights the size of a baseball have been reported moving around sometimes performing aerobatics 
They have been seen to spring suddenly into existence to change shape merge and split  In the 1970s together with Andrew York Devereux made a study of his native Leicestershire to see whether there were any correlations between various phenomena geological features and ancient sites 
They found a high degree of positive relationship between areas of faulting and abnormal meteorological events including UFO activity  An expanded study covering the whole of Britain showed a close correlation between UFO sightings and areas of tectonic activity 
In addition every stone circle in England and Wales was found to be within a mile 1.5 km of a surface fault or on an associated intrusion  The energy which creates earth lights seems to have a sensitizing effect on people so that they are more likely to see things psychically and there may be outbreaks of psychic effects such as poltergeist activity 
This latter has occurred in the vicinity of Hessdalen in Norway where several hundred photographs have now been taken of earth lights and where there is a permanent monitoring post  The reverse also seems to be true the energy plasma appears to be sensitive to psychic and thought forms so that it can actually move or change shape according to the mind of the observer 
The basic question is whether the reports research results anecdotal evidence and folklore refer to some form of known energy which can be easily integrated into the fund of established knowledge or whether they indicate some other more mysterious perhaps more fundamental energy which operates in an altogether different way  Devereux is open on this question though he admits that we know of only some of the invisible and subtler forces that course through creation and even those we are beginning to discover can occur in contexts with which we are unfamiliar 
The existence of a fundamental life energy has been postulated for thousands of years in many different civilizations and crops up independently from sources which had little contact with each other  Its characteristics are remarkably consistent considering the wide cultural span and are suggestive of some reality behind the accounts found in ancient philosophy esoteric writings and the work of researchers into the unorthodox 
Such writings hang together in a remarkable way and one is left with a definite feeling that they are describing a real energy with specific and consistent characteristics  One of the earliest descriptions is of the life energy known as prana given in the ancient Hindu and yoga teachings 
Prana is seen as a universal energy which flows in currents in and around the body  Other energies such as heat are seen as manifestations of prana rather than energies in their own right 
Prana can be inhaled and directed by means of currents flowing down the sheaths of the nerves to all parts of the body  It is present throughout the universe the flow of energy into and out of the body occurring particularly at the energy centres known as chakras at the base of the spine the sex organs solar plexus heart throat brow and the crown of the head 
Ancient cosmology refers to the ether a fifth element filling all space and conceived as a purer form of fire or air  The Druids called this Wouivre or Nwyvre and in the northern tradition it was known 
Hippocrates was aware of this energy which he called Vis Medicatrix Naturae The Healing Power of Nature and it was also known to the medieval alchemists as munia the Vital Fluid  The shamanic kahunas from Hawaii taught that there was an energy called mana which could Mow over threads of shadowy body substance and could carry thought forms 
The physician Paracelsus 1490 1541 saw it as a magnetic influence enabling people who possessed it to heal others as perfume emanates from a lily  His disciple Van Helmont described it as radiating within and around a person like a luminous sphere 
Anton Mesmer 1734â€“1815 from whom the word mesmerism is derived enjoyed great popularity in treating people with what he called animal magnetism  His pupil D'Eslon formulated laws under which animal magnetism seemed to operate it was a universal continuous fluid which was subtle in that it had an ebb and flow it was concentrated in the human body like a magnet and could be accumulated and communicated over a distance 
In 1860 Baron Karl von Reichenbach the discoverer of creosote published the results of numerous experiments with sensitives using techniques which enabled them to sense an energy which he called the odic force od or odyle  He began to realize that it was distinct from heat electricity or magnetism and gradually became able to describe its properties which were very similar to those of animal magnetism 
In more recent times the most highly developed exposition has been that of Wilhelm Reich 1897â€“1957  Although starting in psychoanalysis as a pupil of Freud his work soon spread into what he saw as the related spheres of biology physics meteorology astronomy and politics 
In his therapeutic work he found that mental and emotional problems were often reflected in a patient 's physical appearance and began to think that emotions were locked into the body by muscular tensions a good example being the stiff upper lip and the way that anger can be suppressed by a clenched jaw  Reich developed techniques for releasing these locked-up emotions by a combination of relaxation breathing and massage 
Working in this way he realized that there was some unrecognized form of energy flowing through the body which was interrupted by muscular tensions  His therapeutic techniques enabled the blockages to be dissolved and the body 's energy to flow freely 
Did this energy have some objective reality or was it merely a way of looking at known processes from a different viewpoint  In 1939 Reich found evidence of it by chance when experimenting with the creation of living cells called bions 
He found that they caused radiation effects such as reddening of the skin conjunctivitis and the fogging of photographic plates though tests showed that the level of traditional radiation was normal  Further experiments with what he began to call orgone energy demonstrated that it was present everywhere in the atmosphere and particularly in living things 
It seemed to flow from a weaker to a stronger system thus acting contrary to the Second Law of Thermodynamics  It was always in motion in waves and pulses moving from west to east in the atmosphere 
It could be observed in darkness as a flickering bluish-grey light and there was a force in orgone energy capable of setting a motor in motion  Observing that orgone energy is attracted and absorbed by organic material whereas metal initially absorbs the energy and then repels it rapidly he constructed a box with alternate layers of metal and organic material starting with metal on the inside 
This resulted in a build-up of orgone energy inside the box dependent on the number of layers involved  He also found that sitting a person inside for a period each day helped the processes of healing 
More practical than a rigid accumulator is an orgone blanket which can be made by sewing together layers of wool blanket and steel wool covered by thin cotton  It can be wrapped around various parts of the body with the steel wool side inwards 
That this energy under its various names appears to have been recognized in diverse cultures yet be almost totally ignored by orthodox science is in itself very interesting  It draws us towards other ignored aspects of existence usually called the psychic esoteric or occult and suggests a possible connection 
The essence of any claims for psychic phenomena or powers is that there are alternative realities to the physical  Earth Mysteries researcher Brian Larkman has reminded us that contemporary physics envisages virtual particles which come into existence for almost infinitely small periods of time before disappearing 
He postulates that such particles spend most of their time in a non-material or etheric state momentarily leaping into the physical plane like a salmon leaping fleetingly into view above the water surface  He concludes such a process might be responsible for many of the phenomena of Earth Mysteries indeed for most paranormal events which like the salmon are often extremely elusive 
There is a vast array of both scientific and anecdotal evidence for the existence of states of being other than the physical and there are various ways of understanding such states  One is the Psychic Spectrum whereby different levels of reality or vibrations can be seen as equivalent to the optical spectrum of visible light 
Some have put forward elaborate systems of planes of existence varying from the densest physical to the highest or deepest realms  What is clear is that they are really describing a continuum rather than separate planes 
It seems as if all the universe including the Earth and ourselves is present at all points in this continuum and that we are therefore truly beings at all levels  It is reasonable to assume that ancient people were sensitive to the reality of these other levels of existence living their lives accordingly and it may be that we should look to this awareness as the origin of much folklore 
Support for these other levels of reality has come from biologist Rupert Sheldrake whose Hypothesis of Formative Causation has caused great controversy in scientific circles of recent years  As a result of investigating unsolved problems in biology including how a seed or egg can contain the essence which grows into the new individual member of the same species he postulated something which has long been familiar to those with a spiritual or esoteric background the existence of what must by implication be a non-physical mould or pattern what he calls a morphogenetic field which survives the death of the physical form and which shapes the individual tree animal and flower of each species just as the individual field around a magnet can create a pattern in a scatter of iron filings 
He suggested that these fields are moulded by the form and behaviour of past organisms of the same species through direct connections across both space and time a process he calls morphic resonance  Over thousands of years it has been recognized that the human body has a non-physical component and it is striking that through all the descriptions there is a strong energy theme 
These subtler bodies variously named etheric astral and so on can be seen by sensitives as an aura around the physical body  Dr Walter Kilner developed some screens filled with a dicyanin solution which sensitized the eyes and made it easier for more people to see the aura 
These are available today in the form of goggles  The aura is an energy body 
Within it energy is transformed to and from the physical body through the medium of the chakras  These are related to vitality and sensitives can frequently see disease here before it manifests in the physical 
Just as the blood is circulated through our physical body so energy flows through and between the subtle bodies  Virtually all systems of healing recognize this energy flow that dis-ease results from blockages and that health can be restored by enabling the energies to flow freely 
The old technique of raising the kundalini is in essence allowing energies to well up the spine through all the chakras without obstruction  There are many parallels between the individual human being and the Earth and in the mid-1930s ideas began to be put forward about earth energies linking the long tradition of life energy with the suggestion of place-related energies revealed in folklore 
They also began to suggest strongly that leys were not just the traders ' tracks that Watkins proposed but were closely associated with such earth energy if not actually marking the channels along which such energy might flow  One of the first to do this was the occult writer Dion Fortune who in her book The Goat-Foot God mentions power centres Tintagel in the west St Albans in the east Lindisfarne in the north and St Albans Head in the south 
She refers to the lines joining them as lines of force and states that pagans worship the Old Gods on these rather than at the power centres themselves which had tended to have been exorcized by the Christians by the erection of chapels dedicated to St Michael  She also says where people have been in the habit of reaching out towards the Unseen they wear a kind of track and it 's much easier to go out that way 
Another early writer on earth energies was Straight Track Club member Arthur Lawton  In 1938 he postulated that leys and prehistoric sites marked a network of subtle energy and that this power could be detected 
He found the occurrence of certain standard distances and speculated that this was due to a cosmic force creating a crystalline pattern on the Earth 's surface  John Michell writing of what he calls The Earth Spirit states 
Rocks trees mountains wells and springs were recognized as receptacles for spirit displaying in season their various properties fertilizing therapeutic and oracular  Characteristic of the earth spirit and in accordance with its feminine nature is its tendency to withdraw to decline within the Earth 's dark recesses 
Rocks trees mountains wells and springs were recognized as receptacles for spirit displaying in season their various properties fertilizing therapeutic and oracular  Characteristic of the earth spirit and in accordance with its feminine nature is its tendency to withdraw to decline within the Earth 's dark recesses 
This ties in with archaeologist and dowser Tom Lethbridge 's theory about the Earth 's force-field being concentrated at certain natural features such as waterfalls springs and streams  He thought that the human aura could interact with this force-field at such places 
An individual in a certain state of mind could fix a powerful emotion to a place  Similarly sensitives could pick up such an emotion at places that were so charged 
He saw this as a possible origin of the nymphs of the elements which were known in ancient times the naiads in waterfalls springs and streams dryads in trees and woods oreads in mountains and deserts and nereids in the sea  Perhaps over the generations the interaction between a particular cultural context and the energy pattern at a place could build up a strong image or archetype 
One of the strongest corroborations of the existence of earth energies and the earth spirit has been the emergence of the concept of the Earth as a living being given the name of the Greek goddess Gaia by James Lovelock an independent scientist and thinker with a wide background of disciplines and experience  He is a prolific inventor who helped to start the environmental revolution and as a result of work undertaken for NASA studied the conditions necessary for the continued existence of life and found that the Earth constituted a self-regulatory system whereby each of the many variable factors such as temperature and the composition of air sea and soil had been kept within the narrow limits necessary for life to survive for the entire history of the planet 
It had all the required characteristics of a living being and Lovelock concluded that this indeed was what it was  This recognition has had a major impact not only in the ecological field but also in that of Earth Mysteries 
If the Earth is indeed a living being it was argued then It may possess a subtle body corresponding to the human aura with chakras and flows of energy as well  What the ancient people experienced must largely remain in the realms of speculation but we can look to China for a system which is still in use and very specific on the question of how earth energies relate to the landscape 
It is known as feng shui which means wind-water and it will be examined in Chapter 8  Underlying the practice of feng shui is a recognition of the function of the energy which the Chinese call ch'i or the breath of nature in the health and well-being of a person and it is the fundamental principle underlying the ancient practice of acupuncture 
They widen this to encompass the landscape and flows of energy across the land which they see as providing a climate which may be conducive to or destructive of health and well-being  They evolved a view of landscape which incorporated an awareness of the energy balance of a place seeing ch'i flowing through the landscape concentrating in certain spots becoming stagnant in or dispersing from others 
The breath of nature can be seen as the interplay between the forces of yin and yang flowing in currents known as Lung Mei dragon 's veins around the countryside in winding paths often following contours  These are seen in terms of two different but complementary energy flows known as the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger both aspects of the same energy which need to be balanced 
If the energy is blocked it can turn into what the Chinese call sha noxious or torpid ch'i  The form of the land determines whether energies collect or disperse 
An accumulation of energy encourages growth dispersal of energy results in barrenness and too much energy which is allowed to go stagnant and torpid results in death and decay  The yin landscape is a gently undulating plain the yang that of steep slopes mountains and outcrops 
A desirable state is that of the two energies in balance and the best site is located where there is a change from landscape expressing one type of energy to landscape expressing the other  Where a landscape is dominated by yang forms perhaps high in the mountains the most desirable spot would be one that had yin characteristics 
The site of Castlerigg stone circle in the Lake District is an example where the plateau on which it is sited is surrounded on all sides by mountain peaks  Many stone circles are in fact to be found in such locations 
Where there is a predominantly yin landscape the favourable site would be one which had yang characteristics such as Glastonbury Tor or the sacred aboriginal site of Ayers Rock in Australia both prominent features rising out of a flat plain  Mountains where the dragon 's veins run close to the surface are powerful sources of ch'i 
Mountain peaks are classified according to their shape in terms of the five elements of fire wood water metal and earth  Wood for example was represented by a flattened-off peak and fire by a pointed hill 
Ch'i flows along watercourses the ideal being slow sinuous and deep as it is conducive to the accumulation of ch'i  Straight waterways and sharp bends draw ch'i away too rapidly 
Confluences are good because there is a concentration of ch'i at that point  Sloping well-drained land is conducive to the right amount of ch'i 
Badly drained and low-lying areas are best avoided  Trees help to keep a high level of ch'i and are usually favourable 
Accumulated evidence from recent research combined with ancient traditions all help to build up the conviction that we are dealing with a real but elusive energy which people have recognized throughout history and particularly at special places in the countryside  There can be no definite conclusion at present about whether we are dealing with known energies or whether the evidence suggests some more fundamental force underlying the various observed properties and manifestations 
We are still woefully ignorant about the operation in the landscape of the whole range of natural energies that are known to exist  It seems likely that ch'i for example would cover a wide range of energy effects and Paul Devereux has suggested that sha the noxious form of ch'i could actually be radon gas 
Nevertheless when all factors have been assessed there still remain effects which can not be explained in orthodox terms  The energy behind Earth Lights undoubtedly has electromagnetic properties but there are other aspects of the energy such as its ability to respond to the consciousness of the percipients which suggests something else is involved 
Devereux considers that at root there is a substratum which can only be described as consciousness that this is a field effect and that the brain simply processes the consciousness in a similar way to that in which a television set processes a transmitted signal  He thinks that the ancient sites were locations where altered states of consciousness could more readily occur 
Undoubtedly they were places with magnetic stones and high natural radiation things much rarer than in our modem technological society  Indeed according to Devereux such is the state of our cultural orthodoxy that the consciousness field of the Earth if that is what at root this subtle energy is can really only be experienced in altered states 
If we take Sheldrake 's ideas about morphogenetic fields seriously we may have the suggestion of a hidden energy field actually underlying the formation of the landscape itself giving it both form and character  Must this remain speculation or are there ways we can find out more about this mysterious earth energy 
If earth energies exist what can we find out about them  And how 
Our methods should be appropriate to what we are looking for and we should be clear what our motive is  My emphasis is not to prove anything 
Proof is a relative term anyway each individual requiring a different amount to be convinced  This may depend on their level of awareness or as Edward de Bono puts it in his Second Law of Thinking what appears to be proof is often no more than a lack of imagination in providing an alternative explanation 
The scientific step-by-step approach is not the only way to proceed to flow with creative and fruitful ideas is just as valid and it does n't matter that some ideas fail to meet orthodox criteria  A willingness to take risks and make mistakes in the process is however necessary 
As we are part of our own subject matter we ultimately find ourselves  Astrologers might link these different approaches with planetary aspects in the birth chart 
Reichian analysis would see it in terms of our level of character armouring  If we prove something to our own satisfaction we can release our energies for finding out about the subject proving it to others takes second place 
I am in sympathy with the approach Tony Wedd advocated which was to accept temporarily everything that was put forward to work with it and see where it got you the attitude of the technologist as opposed to the scientist  So I am going to suggest ways of finding out about earth energies and of understanding the processes involved how the ancient peoples related to them and how we may ourselves be able to build a stronger link 
The importance of a holistic approach using both analytical and intuitive methods is vital and it is noteworthy that many of the leading figures in the Earth Mysteries field have been trained in both arts and sciences and see the fruitfulness of combining the two approaches  If we want to find out about ancient people and the sites they used and constructed our first thought might be to consult the archaeologists 
Much knowledge has been accumulated since the antiquarians first started to take an interest and archaeology has become an increasingly scientific discipline using modern techniques such as aerial photography which has vastly increased the number of known sites and carbon dating which has caused radical rethinking of accepted chronology  Whilst a profusion of information has been revealed archaeology has by its very nature been largely concerned with what is found physically which tends to emphasize the mundane domestic level of existence 
It has been more difficult for it to investigate the non-physical nature of prehistoric society  The purpose of the vast megalithic constructions for example remains almost as mysterious now as it did in the nineteenth century 
Archaeologists are beginning to realize this and are looking at alternative approaches seeing sites as part of the landscape and related to one another something which has been advocated by students of leys and Earth Mysteries for many years  Prehistoric archaeology has immensely broadened its approach over the last twenty years 
Just as the archaeological establishment is slowly changing and a willingness to try new approaches becomes evident so Earth Mysteries enthusiasts have begun to undertake archaeological training  But some of the most fruitful findings at ancient sites have been by those such as the researchers on the Dragon Project discussed later in this chapter trained in disciplines other than archaeology 
Despite these cautions recent archaeological findings have provided much of value to the study of Earth Mysteries particularly concerning the extent to which linear features were a prominent part of the prehistoric landscape and the acceptance that monuments such as chambered tombs had more of a ritual function  We now know that the detached scientific observer is a myth we are intimately tied up with whatever we are observing 
The distinction between the individual and what is being looked for can be confused the problem is that we do n't always know how much  It can be fairly clear when looking for something physical but in trying to find earth energies there are difficulties in determining what comes from the individual and what from the site 
The psychic sense involves finding things out other than by the normal physical senses  It is probably a lot more common than is generally realized a background noise which only becomes noticeable when emphasized to such a degree that we can no longer ignore it 
An analogy might be the lip-reading that we do at an unconscious level  It is only when I take off my glasses that I realize the extent to which the skill is providing back-up information 
Psychometry is the ability to discern something about an object or its owner by holding it and visualizing its history  It is the purest form of finding out about an ancient site but it does depend on the ability of the observer to distinguish information that may be coming in from a variety of sources 
The technique is to allow through the first impressions that come to you  Do n't filter them out because they seem silly and do n't be afraid of being wrong 
If you are honest approaching with an open mind and saying the first thing that comes into your head you will gradually find you are able to contribute real information and will gain confidence in your abilities  Psychometry can of course be extended from an object to a whole site 
Here the technique is to wander round touching the stones or whatever allowing expression to whatever comes to you  Any opening of oneself psychically particularly at ancient sites which have a long and largely unknown history can be hazardous and it is best undertaken with caution and proper attunement 
The whole question of approaching sites is covered in Chapter 10  The most straightforward use of psychic ability is in finding archaeological remains which at least is something which can later be verified 
The method came to prominence through the activities of Frederick Bligh Bond a highly respected authority on medieval church architecture  In 1908 he was appointed to excavate the remains of Glastonbury Abbey and made use of the services of a friend Captain John Bartlett who with automatic writing brought through messages from monks who had lived at Glastonbury together with detailed plans of the Abbey showing a large hitherto unknown chapel at the eastern end named after King Edgar 
Two years later Bligh Bond started excavations and found the Edgar Chapel in the position and of the size predicted  When the story was published he was dismissed from his post and had great difficulty raising money for further excavations 
Archaeology in the sense of deciding where to excavate is perhaps a good example of where the psychic ability may often be used unconsciously  Even dowsing is obliquely referred to in the official reports as probing with metal rods 
This has had much prominence in the Earth Mysteries field but is somewhat difficult to define  In its archetypal form it involves tuning in psychically to past lives to artefacts hidden in the countryside and to issues not resolved in the past 
The method has all the elements of a fictional adventure story and yet it can not be dismissed so easily  it seems as if there were people in medieval and earlier times aware of the significance of particular sites who have in some way we do not fully understand left instructions and clues which can be followed by those who can tune in to them 
Go on any Earth Mysteries trip to an ancient site and it is highly likely that you will see at least one person walking holding wire rods or holding a weight on the end of a piece of string  You might even see more elaborate devices 
What on Earth is going on  All these people are doing is using their psychic faculties 
They are however making use of a tool to help them just as a botanist might use a magnifying glass  The instrument acts like an amplifier to enable subtle mental or physical responses to be noticed 
However elaborate the equipment it is merely magnifying the natural psychic ability or lack of it that the individual might have  It implies nothing else dowsing is not inherently more reliable than any other method involving the psychic senses 
The presence of equipment does not change that  Dowsing is no more objective than more obviously and directly psychic methods particularly where it is concerned with detection of earth energies rather than physical artefacts water and so on 
Pennick and Devereux are blunt on this point The dowsing rod has become an implement to authorise the acceptance of subjective ideas as factual statements  Dowsing and other devices including the various ley detectors invented by Jimmy Goddard appear to be a way of bringing this general psychic awareness into focus demonstrating it in a form which our conscious mind can handle 
Dowsing depends on the interaction between the person and the site at a particular time  The fact that different dowsers can get very different results on the same site can perhaps be explained as the interaction between their own energy field and the field of the site so that the dowsing patterns found can only have true meaning by looking at the dowser as well 
The dowsing response can tell as much about the dowser as about the site under investigation  Dowsing has a long history 
The traditional hazel rod was a freshly cut forked stick held in both hands by each fork in some tension so that a slight movement of the hand could result in a large movement of the rod  These days most dowsers use angle rods which can be cut from a wire coat-hanger each rod bent at right-angles 
It is useful to bind the ends with drafting tape to avoid accidents  Hold them loosely in each hand with the long arms straight ahead 
Adjust the angle with your wrists so that a small movement will cause the rods to cross  That is the mechanism what you have to do is use it 
Focus the mind as precisely as possible on what you want to find and start to walk  When you find what you are looking for that part of you which knows more than the conscious mind will send a message to the muscles in your hand which will cause the rods to cross 
That is all there is to it the skill is in being clear about what you want to find  The pendulum consists of a weight on the end of a piece of string thread or chain usually a few inches long 
It is more often used indoors  You hold the end of the string and the muscles in the hand cause the bob to gyrate or swing in pendulum fashion 
The pendulum can thus be used to answer yes/no type questions  One interesting application is map dowsing where the map as a representation of the landscape can be dowsed in substitution for the real landscape 
The technique is the same move a pointer over the map with one hand and dowse with the other  The knack in dowsing is to be in the right frame of mind not caring too much what answer you get but at the same time having a clear idea of what you are looking for otherwise you are opening yourself up to a very wide waveband and things will get very confused 
This is the difficulty in dowsing for earth energies  We are all familiar with water as our bodies are mostly made up of it and it is the easiest thing to dowse for 
Even with minerals and lost objects we have a reasonably clear idea of what we are looking for and the dowser can be proved right or wrong  When it comes to earth energies we really have no idea 
Most dowsers have attempted to find the patterns of earth energies at a site and have detected spirals concentric circles and straight or sinuous lines all of which seem to vary over time  Perhaps the best way to use dowsing in Earth Mysteries is to look for something definite a lost markstone for example or an alignment 
Immediately we get into dowsing for energy whether it be lines or points or spirals we have a problem of tuning in to what we want to find  The waveband is just too wide 
I am not saying that natural energy flows do not exist but to detect them alongside the multitude of artificial energy sources and the thought forms of everyone who has visited or passed through the site is likely to be confusing to say the least  At any rate treat all results with the greatest of caution and do n't make too much of them 
Dowsing has been used in association with more traditional ley-hunting techniques  An example is the Pitch Hill ley project organized by the Surrey Earth Mysteries Group 
A line was initially dowsed when plotted on a map it was found to fall on an alignment of sites which was then followed and dowsed  Even here the possibility of detecting a wide range of different effects is high 
There is no generally agreed explanation for how dowsing works and some consider that the answer lies in emanations from whatever is being sought  One thing is clear however it does work 
I have seen Water Board engineers using angle rods to locate a water main presumably because it was more effective than relying on plans which are apt to be inaccurate and easier than trial and error  But to conclude the subject of dowsing and intuitive ways of finding out about ancient sites the only way is to have a go yourself 
As I discuss at greater length in Chapter 10 your first visits should just be a matter of getting to know the site by wandering around  Let the site itself tell you what is there and then follow your natural impressions 
Try dowsing without rods it 's much less cumbersome  Imagine them it works just as well 
Despite its limitations and difficulties dowsing was one of the sources of inspiration for the Dragon Project which I mentioned briefly at the beginning of the last chapter  In 1975 author Francis Hitching was commissioned to write a book and television documentary entitled Earth Magic 
He had made contact with various people involved in the field including myself and arranged to meet veteran dowser Bill Lewis who took him to the 12ft 4m high Llangynidr standing stone near Crickhowell  He had dowsed a spiral of energy on the stone which he found varied over time 
He asked Hitching to find out whether this could be detected scientifically  Hitching contacted John Taylor Professor of Mathematics at King 's College London who suspected that Lewis might be responding to small changes in magnetism 
To measure the strength of the magnetic field he supplied a gaussmeter which was to be operated by the young Argentinian physicist Dr Eduardo Balanovski  He found a very strong field on and around the stone much greater than background levels 
On testing the bands of energy which Lewis had marked on the stone Balanovski found the field to be twice as strong as on other parts of the stone  Monitoring of this sort seemed to offer a way forward 
When Paul Devereux took over The Ley Hunter in 1976 it was widely assumed that some form of energy existed at ancient sites but there had been virtually no research to back these ideas up  In November 1977 a meeting of interested individuals from different disciplines was called to discuss the possibility of establishing some sort of research programme 
The group included physicists materials scientists dowsers psychometrists electrical engineers psychologists artists and other Earth Mysteries workers  Incidentally it is interesting to note that this occurred only five days after the discovery of the planetoid Chiron the astrological meaning of which includes the collaboration of previously separate and antagonistic disciplines 
The philosophy right from the start was the need to incorporate a variety of approaches both analytical and intuitive  The work fell naturally into two sections physical monitoring of known energies led by Dr Don Robins a materials scientist and specialist in piezoelectricity in archaeological research and the psychic approach including dowsing and psychometry co-ordinated by Californian archaeologist and parapsychologist John Steele 
The programme would be known as the Dragon Project after the Chinese representation of earth energies  It s objectives published in 1978 were To detect by quantifiable physical and biological means the manifestation of earth energy' at prehistoric sites and to relate this to the ultimate nature of earth energy and to the suspected prehistoric manipulation of this energy' 
Because of limited resources efforts were initially to be concentrated on a particular site  This would have to be convenient for London where most of the participants lived and in view of the unorthodox nature of the enterprise preferably in private ownership 
The Rollright stone circle in the Cotswolds fitted the bill perfectly  it was a 100 ft 30m diameter circle with stones made of limestone up to 7ft 2m tall 
In addition to the circle there was the King Stone standing stone and the Whispering Knights a dolmen in close proximity  Grinsell describes it as having one of the richest collections of folklore of any British prehistoric site 
Crucially it was within 100 miles 160km of London and the owner Pauline Flick was willing to allow the programme to proceed and to occupy the hut on the site  From the start lack of resources hampered research work 
There was little money to buy equipment and negotiations had to take place to persuade university departments to lend valuable items over weekends  Sites needed to be monitored continuously in order to pick up fluctuations 
In the initial phase of the project this proved impossible in terms of equipment and volunteers but was remedied to some extent later by Operation Merlin whereby intensive efforts provided round-the-clock monitoring for periods of a month at a time  The physical monitoring started with very little clear idea of how to proceed 
Lines of enquiry suggested themselves from reported material which had accumulated over the years on possible energy effects at ancient sites  An example was ultrasound suggested by a zoologist whose colleague 's bat detector which receives sound in ultrasonic frequencies had picked up a strong signal emanating from a nearby ancient site 
The King Stone Warwickshire  Illustration by Guy Ragland Phillips 
The approach of the Dragon Project to energies was straightforward  We may be dealing with an energy currently unknown to science but it made sense to start by monitoring known energies 
They may provide a clue by their behaviour even if this turned out later to be merely the secondary effect of some more fundamental energy  The range of physical monitoring undertaken by the project has been extensive and I can only briefly indicate below the main features of this and the conclusions so far reached 
The instrument used initially was a wide band receiver in the 25â€“80kHz range adapted from a bat detector  In autumn 1978 ultrasonic pulsing at two-second intervals was recorded at dawn at the King Stone 
In December that year there was one occasion when within the circle there was not even the normal background level which could be detected outside  This zero-field effect has not been repeated 
There was an outburst of ultrasonic pulsing in February 1979 starting 8â€“10 minutes before sunrise at new moon and 25 35 minutes before sunrise at full moon  The effect would continue through sunrise and up to 2 3 hours afterwards 
This gradually lessened through the spring and disappeared completely in the summer  There was no equivalent pulsing recorded at the control sites being monitored 
In January 1987 a clicking signal at 37kHz was detected coming from a band 3ft in width halfway up the tallest stone in the circle  The effect diminished half an hour after sunrise but was repeated at noon 
The pattern of ultrasonics at Rollright has so far remained elusive  Radioactivity exists naturally emanating from the rocks that make up the Earth 's crust particularly granite and also in cosmic rays from space 
There are various ways of monitoring radiation the best known being the Geiger counter  Initially the project had use of a very basic one which involved the manual counting of audible bleeps which could then be averaged to counts per minute 
Many other sites as well as Rollright have been monitored and the general conclusion so far is that there are radiation anomalies but they vary over time and that only an intensive continuous study at a site is likely to reveal the pattern  Some sites have radiation levels higher than the general background in the area but there is a tendency for Cornish circles to be below background 
Some such as the Merry Maidens have specific parts which are above background level and others which are below  Robins found that Geiger readings there were halved when taken within a few feet of the ring of stones as if the ring acted as a form of shield 
In 1983 the Gaia Programme was set up in conjunction with the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena ASSAP  Scores of volunteers took part in ten-hour sessions monitoring radiation at and in the vicinity of thirty sites and control locations 
Results show a much greater variation of readings at stone circle sites compared with the control locations but for the patterns and cycles involved to be defined long-term continuous monitoring at numerous sites will have to take place  Balanovski 's earlier findings at the Llangynidr Stone in Wales suggested that magnetism might be a line of enquiry worth pursuing though efforts were frustrated for some time due to the failure to obtain the necessary equipment 
An interim experiment took place in 1981 with tubes of brine shrimp which are sensitive to changes in the magnetic field they seemed to cluster at the end of the tube which was nearest the stones  Then in 1982 independently of the Dragon Project Charles Brooker a retired BBC engineer carried out a magnetic survey of the Rollright Stones 
He found that the intensity of the magnetic field within the circle was lower than that outside  He also found a spiral of relative magnetic intensity two stones on the west side of the circle were pulsing magnetically in cycles varying from 40 to 60 seconds 
Later the project was able to borrow a more advanced flux-gate magnetometer and the preliminary conclusions from Rodney Hale an experienced electronics engineer as a result of further work are that there is a magnetic field within the circle which fluctuates relative to that outside over a period of hours  An infra-red photograph of the King Stone taken in April 1979 at sunrise showed a glow around the stone and a ray sloping off from it which photographic experts have not been able to explain 
A photograph taken by Devereux in January 1986 of a larger stone on the western side of the circle which had been the subject of short-term magnetic anomalies showed a discharge from the top of the stone  Generally a broad-band radio receiver works best with the receiver held in the air with the signal fading away when the aerial is brought near the ground 
However at highly localized areas around but not within the Rollright circle another signal could be picked up almost at ground level  Analysis of the signal demonstrated its artificial nature but its behaviour remains unexplained 
Whilst much work remains to be done energy anomalies do seem to exist at prehistoric sites  As Larkman remarks 
This is vital information for any understanding of prehistoric motivation and vastly increases the range of data available from a ceremonial site  It is time for many such ideas to be amalgamated into a fresh overview of prehistory time for them to be applied holistically 
Conventional archaeology must now be seen as only one aspect of a balanced study of prehistory not the dominant factor  This is vital information for any understanding of prehistoric motivation and vastly increases the range of data available from a ceremonial site

In more recent years the work of the Dragon Project has extended from Rollright to dozens of other sites throughout the country including control sites  it has however been characterized throughout by limited resources and was never expected to produce detailed results but rather to identify areas which should be investigated further 
In 1987 the Dragon Project Trust was set up to continue the work of the project and to study effects on consciousness at sites where specific geophysical anomalies have been noted  Details of the Trust can be found on p. 123 
The term Earth Mysteries covers not just ancient sites but also the people who visited them and found them significant in their lives  We too are part of the whole subject area ourselves our own can be immensely varied and looking at the various ways people have responded to the natural energies manifesting at ancient sites is central 
Paul Devereux sees the whole field of Earth Mysteries in the form of a tree  The top of the tree consists of ways in which we can sense such as archaeology psychometry dowsing and aesthetic response 
The next layer of the tree integrates major areas like geomancy which will be discussed in the next chapter  The point at the top of the trunk is occupied by the single theme energies 
The trunk represents the site itself and the roots are the living Earth beneath the site  In many ways the area at the top of the tree parallels a structure called the Spectrum of Response which I described in 1985 
The degree of interaction between observer and energies is reflected in the spectrum and I have divided it into six strands experience attunement ritual interaction manipulation and control  Clearly these merge into each other but they range from at one extreme the individual who visits an ancient site becomes aware of the energies and then goes on their way to at the other extreme those who try to control the earth energies for their own ends 
The further along the spectrum we find ourselves the more we need knowledge and wisdom to be able to handle the results  It is really a question of where we feel happiest and how much we see ourselves as part of nature rather than in conflict with it 
Modern society tends towards the latter end of the spectrum feeling that it has to control nature in all its many aspects  As well as providing a useful way of looking at people 's response to the Earth through the physical structures which have survived and as a way of interpreting legend the Spectrum of Response is also a framework into which we can fit our own relationship to the landscape 
Like any faculty the psychic sense is more prominent if it is used and If the society in which an individual lives is conducive in its attitudes to the encouragement of such ability  The traditional peoples in the world today such as the Australian aborigines are profoundly and naturally psychic and it is at least reasonable therefore to speculate that the ancient peoples were similarly sensitive and would have been aware of earth energies as a natural part of their environment 
Brian Larkman has shown that properly translated orthodox anthropological writings can be read in such a way  He gives recognize two states of being Yidjaru which relates to the material world and Djugurba which equates with the non-material 
They see the landscape as being formed by dreamings which came into the material world at so-called waterholes which may or may not correspond to an actual waterhole  The dreamings follow a set path as they alter the topography leaving their potency or Guruwari at specific points en route before disappearing back to the non-material world at the point where they came in 
He writes  It seems to me that they are describing at first hand a world made up of physical materials similar to those which we can see and touch with an invisible to most of us non-material life force much like the ether superimposed on it and within it 
It seems to me that they are describing at first hand a world made up of physical materials similar to those which we can see and touch with an invisible to most of us non-material life force much like the ether superimposed on it and within it  The way in which earth energies are experienced seems to vary according to cultural expectations so that pure energy is interpreted in ways acceptable to the individual or culture 
This seems to be the case with reported visions of the Virgin Mary identification of whom usually occurs after the initial vision which is frequently by children outdoors at springs or streams  At La Salette children saw a bright light near a stream then a lady who appeared and disappeared 
At Lourdes Bernadette Soubirous saw what she described as that thing which was thought to be the ghost of a local girl  Paul Devereux in the context of Earth Lights suggests that the percipient may have a real effect on how the energy actually manifests 
The intensity and character of earth energies also seem to fluctuate according to the time of day month and year  When combined with the sensitivity and psychic state of the experiencer a whole range of possibilities opens up 
Direct perception by psychics of energy manifestations in the landscape has a very long history  It merges into folklore myth and legend 
In modem times many people have claimed to be able to see fairies  The Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson gives detailed descriptions of various elemental beings which he had the ability to observe in various natural locations 
Whilst the famous photographs of the Cottingley fairies taken in 1917 have been admitted not to be genuine it is equally clear from the researches of author Joe Cooper that at least one of the girls concerned Frances Griffiths did see fairies in Cottingley Glen as did Geoffrey Hodson  Ogilvie Crombie known as REX also acquired this ability perhaps by living alone in a forest for ten years and was able to contact nature spirits including a being identifying as the Great God Pan 
He was closely associated with the community at Findhorn in Scotland where Dorothy Maclean and subsequently several others were able to make contact with the devas higher level beings embodying the essence of a particular species or in particular cases of a place  Detailed guidance was frequently the result of such contact 
This seems very similar to Sheldrake 's concept of the morphogenetic field and to Lethbridge 's ideas on the formation of the nymphs of the elements  Attunement as used here means more than the mere experience of earth energies and implies some response often called artistic inspiration and expression 
But first how do we experience landscape  Appleton considers the major factor to be the ability to see without being seen 
It may also be our ability to respond to energies in the landscape such as the Chinese describe in their concept of ch'i Chapter 4  The attraction of a landscape to an individual will thus be a result of energies however defined running through both the individual and the landscape 
In order for earth energies to inspire the individual needs to be in a place where and at a time when those energies are strong and also needs to allow such energies to flow freely through them  We can tune in to these energies more easily at particular places than others and it is actually easier to meditate for example at such places 
The climate is better for the raising of perception or in poetic terms the veil between this world and beyond is thinner  Landscape and the sacred sites within it can be both an inspiration for art and the stage on which that artistic expression is played out 
In this sense ancient people were artists as they lived their whole lives in harmony with the Earth but were they artists in the more conventional sense  Certainly some of their art such as cave paintings survives and may provide a clue as to how they thought 
In Britain rock art was a major feature consisting frequently of cup-and-ring marks  These are usually made up of a central pit or cup surrounded by one ring or concentric rings or spiral turns 
There are occasional more elaborate designs such as on the Tree of Life Stone near Otley Yorkshire  The marks are usually found on rock outcrops at the edge of upland moors particularly in the Galloway Clyde and Argyll areas of Scotland Northumberland and Rombalds Moor in Yorkshire 
Though the greatest concentration seems to be in Britain perhaps only because Britain has been searched most thoroughly this type of design is found throughout the world  Many different explanations have been put forward but the similarity of many of the cup-and-ring carvings to such diverse phenomena as lines found by dowsers and the symbols used to describe sacred places in Australia and elsewhere suggests strongly that they represent aspects of the non-physical reality which ancient people could see 
Brian Larkman has speculated on their significance  The very act of carving the symbols in the rock can create an electrical charge which could be seen by a sensitive 
Such an idea catches the imagination stones that glow and sparkle as the curving patterns are chipped and pecked into them circles and cups and lines that not only symbolise some holy and sacred place but that pulsate with the life of the earth dancing her spirit across their surface  It is just such a spirit that would be wanted to animate the fertility of the earth and ensure the continuance of increase and plenty in the plants and animals that a browsing existence depends upon 
How better to release it than to ritually carve the sacred pattern each year close to the slowly fading illuminations of earlier ceremonies  The very act of carving the symbols in the rock can create an electrical charge which could be seen by a sensitive

Illustration by Brian Larkman  Whilst the forms of inspiration vary the individual needs to attune to the atmosphere of the place so that it can encourage the artistic and creative faculties to respond and generate output that is deeper finer and more prolific than otherwise 
Many artists poets and composers have drawn inspiration from the landscape and have felt the need to visit sites  Sometimes this is clearly reflected in the work of art produced sometimes the connection is more indirect 
The composer Edward Elgar for example needed the solitary paths of the countryside around the Malvern Hills and often spoke of hearing songs and sounds not heard by others  He used to say I think music is in the air all around me I 've only to take as much as I want 
This immersion in the landscape is the technique used by poet and Earth Mysteries researcher Ian Taylor before writing his book The All Saints ' Ley Hunt  He walked every ley until the landscape started to speak to him 
Paul Devereux has drawn our attention to the Irish nature mystic George William Russell who wrote under the pseudonym AE  He was aware of the earth spirit and seemed consciously able to tune in to what he called earth memories and the memory of nature 
Under certain states of consciousness he could become aware of the subtler dimensions of the landscape and wrote  These earth memories come to us in various ways 
When we are passive and the ethereal medium which is the keeper of such images not broken up by thought is like clear glass or calm water then there is often a glowing of colour and form upon it and there is what may be a reflection from some earth memory connected with the place we move in or it may be we have direct vision of that memory  These earth memories come to us in various ways 
When we are passive and the ethereal medium which is the keeper of such images not broken up by thought is like clear glass or calm water then there is often a glowing of colour and form upon it and there is what may be a reflection from some earth memory connected with the place we move in or it may be we have direct vision of that memory  There are artists whose inspiration and field of action is the landscape itself 
One of the best known is Richard Long  His work typically consists of some form of activity in the countryside which is then recorded by a photograph or map 
He has for example created a visible straight line across grass by repeated walking walked a ten mile 1.6 km dead straight line across Exmoor walked all the roads and tracks within a six mile 10 km radius of the Cerne Abbas giant walked from Stonehenge to Glastonbury on Midsummer 's Day and created cairns stone circles and labyrinths at specific sites in the landscape  He has never admitted an awareness of Earth Mysteries as an inspiration for his work but the walking of straight lines echoes not only leys but also the task of the Gaia Programme monitors who were required to take regular readings on straight lines out from ancient sites 
The work of Andy Goldsworthy must also be mentioned  He uses natural materials in the natural landscape and by arranging them draws attention to their significance such as forming decaying leaves into a pattern which emphasizes their variation in colour 
His photographs of these works are freezing a changing process in time  Photography has a central place in the Earth Mysteries field by virtue of Watkins ' status as a Gold Medal list of the Royal Photographic Society 
This feel for his native countryside comes through strongly in his photographs person camera and landscape being in creative harmony  He considered that the best-composed photographs were taken along the ley 
Photographs say something often very subtly about how the photographer sees and relates to the landscape  Through this relationship they can also be a record of the life force that exists at a certain site 
Artists such as Jill Smith and Bruce Lacey have developed the idea of performance at sacred sites both as an artistic expression and also as a form of ritual whereby the artist may be inspired to receive insights into the original purposes behind sacred sites  Bob Trubshaw poses the question Is the act of visiting an ancient site a piece of performance art 
To use the landscape itself as the stage or background for artistic expression takes us to the very boundaries of art until as we step across we realize that the whole of life is or could be Art  In essence ritual is very simple 
In the context of ancient sites it involves becoming aware of the special nature of the place and taking some action however small in recognition of this  Guy Ragland Phillips gives an example 
Annabel the daughter of a friend paid us a quick visit from the other end of the country  We took her to see the Three Howes prehistoric mounds on the summit of the moors 
From the road she followed the track alone  After a while sitting in the car we saw her stand for a few minutes first on one of the Howes then on another still and with arms raised 
She was in prayer  Annabel the daughter of a friend paid us a quick visit from the other end of the country

Ritual can therefore be an individual spontaneous activity but society and tradition are also important factors  Folklore suggests that dancing took place at stone circles on occasions such as the seasonal festivals 
Much of the significance of ancient sites comes from their use for ritual purposes and this is borne out by the survivals of ancient traditions  Certainly witches still have a tradition of performing rites at special places in the countryside and it seems natural for people to want to express their relationship with the Earth in the form of ritual at sites where they know the earth energy can be found 
The climate of the place is however only one part of the equation the other is the state of mind that the person brings to it  This is where ritual may come in making it easier to attune to the energies 
Witches for example have a series of rites aimed at achieving this result including the casting of the magic circle to keep the power from dissipating  The use of ritual which may involve dancing psychoactive plants and other techniques may be directed towards the achievement of altered states of consciousness or to specific ends such as healing 
Alan Bleakley tells of some very fruitful rituals including working with archetypal images which have taken place at various stone circles in Cornwall where individuals were considerably helped by being able to tune in to the spirit of the place  The form and position of stone circles tree clumps and wells strongly suggest a ritual approach along an ancient trackway as if walking the paths that others have trod before encourages the energies to manifest 
This may correspond with a ley or may be something of a more sinuous natural  Michell elaborates on this 
The ways between these places  are ways of the earth spirit not merely secular routes but natural channels of energy first traced out by the creative gods followed by the primeval wandering tribes and still in settled times used by religious processions or pilgrims to a shrine 
Traditionally they are also paths of psychic activity of apparitions spirits of the dead or fairies particularly on one day of the year  People of the Irish countryside recognize certain lines unmarked on the ground as fairy paths lines of a seasonal flow of spirit which must on no account be obstructed or built on

Certain paths also had a teaching function  The custom of beating the bounds by taking children around the parish boundary and beating at significant points in order that the children should remember them is a reflection of this 
Before people could generally read learning was by word of mouth and much took place in the countryside along the paths particular truths being imparted at certain places which thereby took on special significance  Walking the paths was thus a ritual act what the Buddhists might call walking meditation and the paths themselves reflected this importance 
A deeper understanding of the function of leys might emerge if they could be seen in ritual terms  Imagine a trackway winding across a hillside no more than a sheep track perhaps or an ancient drove road 
Every person or animal that follows the path seems to leave a trail of energy and these energy paths build up over time  At intervals along the path the energy intensifies 
Here animals stop to rest or to give birth and individuals pause for momentary contemplation  Each occurrence at such a spot builds up the energy store until after generations it begins to be noticed more consciously 
A standing stone is erected or a tree planted followed generations later by a wayside cross church inn or even village  Or perhaps the subtle energy with which the place is charged will encourage the growth of a tree or the thickening of a hedge 
These are spots sanctified by time and thus are some sacred sites born the result of the interaction between people and the landscape instinctive working with earth energies to increase the significance of place  From ancient times the significance of particular dates has survived centuries of attempts to stamp out the old pagan customs and they are still popularly practised in many parts of the country 
The 'Obby 'Oss tradition in Padstow Cornwall takes place on May Day  Many villagers take part and the place is decorated with flowers and branches 
The festivities start the previous night the hypnotic beat of the drum and the traditional song having a very strong effect  The 'obby 'oss itself is a huge circular black skirt with a sharp-beaked head which whirls around supported by a team of dancers 
The village of West Witton in Yorkshire holds the ceremony of the Burning of Bartle on the Saturday nearest to 24 August St Bartholomew 's Day to whom the local church is dedicated  An effigy of Bartle said to be a medieval sheep thief though undoubtedly a much older figure is paraded round the village after dark and then set alight 
Many other pagan traditions still continue or are being revived  They are the public face of the secret survival of ancient belief and practice tied up with the power of the landscape 
Invaders bring their own religions and practices and in Britain particularly the old traditions had to go underground  Ancient knowledge of the existence significance and power of particular places was preserved in secret as it would not have been acceptable to the Church or society at large 
There are many strands to this secret tradition and one of the most direct and striking is that of witchcraft  Whilst most modern witch covens can be traced back only as far as the revival stimulated by Gerald Gardner and the repeal of the Witchcraft Acts in the 1950s there still exist traditional covens which date back much further 
The beliefs and practices of witchcraft with an emphasis on the cycles and hidden aspects of nature the special significance of places and the generation by such means as dancing of the cone of power within a magic circle from the energy residing within the human body tie in very well with the insights obtained through Earth Mysteries research  Other traditions also kept ancient knowledge alive 
Gypsies and other travelling people retain an instinctive awareness of the significance of sites and the flow of subtle energies through the seasons in a far stronger form than more settled people  It is tempting to imagine an exchange of information and assistance between gypsies and witches both being subjected at times to severe persecution 
Within Christianity there have always been strands such as the Templars Cathars and Rosicrucians that have retained an awareness of the old secrets  Writers such as Paul Screeton and Andrew Collins have speculated on the existence of an inner priesthood whereby certain churches on particularly sacred sites have specially selected clergy 
More recently the Freemasons and the various magical orders have continued certain traditions  It is a testimony to the fundamental nature of pagan beliefs and practices that they have survived centuries of persecution 
What has also survived at least in part is a landscape which has been moulded according to those beliefs  The instinctive artistic and ritualistic responses to earth energies are not the only ones 
There is also the path of geomancy where actions are taken which can affect the quality of the physical environment and as a consequence the inner being  The mystic and the magician are examples of contrasting approaches 
The mystic seeks to experience the unity of existence through a variety of practices and environments essentially the approaches examined in the previous chapter were examples of the mystical path as revealed in the landscape  By contrast the magician seeks to understand the energies of the universe and to work with them in order to bring about changes ultimately within the self but including the environment in all its aspects 
This distinction between mystic and magician is helpful provided we realize that the two archetypes con be combined  This chapter looks at geomancy and the variety of ways of which the magical approach is but one in which people have modified their environment in order to achieve inner change 
One major strand of geomancy is sacred geometry  As soon as people began to build artificial forms and structures sacred geometry came into being as the pattern conscious or unconscious underlying a particular structure 
The name is somewhat misleading since in ancient times it seems likely that the division of life into sacred and secular had no meaning the whole of life was considered sacred as were artistic and other creations  The creation of structure was for a purpose the hermetic principle of as above so below imitating the macrocosm in the microcosm bringing the vastness of nature and the universe down to a scale we can relate to 
Form can create atmosphere and one of the main functions of artificial structures is to create an environment in which consciousness changes can more readily occur  The essential forms of artificial structures stem from an awareness of the way in which the principles of shape proportion number measure and relationship occur in nature 
Straight lines can be found in shadows rays from the sun or moon or their reflection on water the stem of a tall grass rock strata or clear waterfall  The circle could be seen in the discs of sun and moon and their related haloes and rainbows 
More complex structures were revealed in crystals and precise proportional relationships could be found in the arrangement of leaves and branches and the spirals of growing shoots  The effect of shape on function is recognized in sacred geometry 
All the fundamental shapes were used the straight line circle triangle and square revealed in leys stone circles and the elaborate structures in mediaeval churches together with others of symbolic significance such as the pentagram hexagram and vesica piscis  Proportions of all kinds exist in Nature such as the relationships between the daily monthly and yearly cycles 
Two of particular significance are the Golden Mean and the Fibonacci series  The Golden Mean is the division of a line such that the smaller part is the same proportion of the larger part that the larger part is of the whole 
It is approximately 1:1.618 and has been recognized by artists throughout history as being uniquely harmonious  It is also represented by the relationship of the sides of a pentagon drawn between the points of a pentagram and the sides of the pentagram itself 
The Fibonacci series is produced by adding together the last two numbers in a sequence to get the next number 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 and so on  It is found underlying much natural form from the shape of horns to the pads on a cat 's foot 
The principle of proportion is at the heart of our aesthetic awareness and close to the life principle controlling plant growth  Artificial structures have used such proportions for both these reasons and probably also because of their effect on sound and subtle energies 
The principles of number are at the heart of the universe  The nature and character of unity twoness threeness and so on underlie the whole of existence 
Astrologers have probably come closest to understanding these principles in their use of planetary aspects and in the theory and techniques of harmonic astrology pioneered by John Addey  We have already noted that folklore associates certain numbers particularly three seven and nine with prehistoric sites 
Other traditions such as military regimes and cultures with a central control are based on the division of land by means of the cardinal directions and subdivision by halving resulting in a fourfold and eightfold division  In astrology the two-series of aspects 2,4,8 etc is connected with the way we relate to the outside world whereas the three-series 3,9 etc is more about internal harmony this may provide a clue to the meanings underlying the use of number in sacred geometry 
By analysing distances in stone circles the surveyor Alexander Thorn found a unit of measure of some 2.72ft which he called the Megalithic Yard  Traditional measures are based on average lengths of different parts of the body and are related to each other in terms of significant numbers such as three and twelve 
The ancient people were well aware of the way in which the principles of sacred geometry were a reflection of Nature  In creating artificial forms they were not only careful to ensure that their siting was appropriate but also that all the elements in the design such as shape proportion and size respected Nature rather than acted against it 
It is because these principles have been lost that much modern architecture is criticized there is no link with or respect for Nature  The skills required to use such awareness to create artificial form are those of the geomant a combination of shaman geographer town and country planner sculptor architect artist and landscape designer 
Geomancy sacred geometry and magic all aim to achieve effects both in the individual and the outside world using the energies of the universe by flowing with them  This is similar to technology which aims to make things happen rather than find out why they happen 
But this is no ordinary technology we are dealing with the subtle energies which flow through the Earth and which have their own ways and seasons  Tony Wedd invented the word allotechnology for this form of technology as it is different in kind and basic principles of operation from that which is presently dominant in our society 
He accumulated information on a variety of devices from different sources including claimed contact with people from beyond this planet and was able to elucidate certain basic principles including the use of free energy no moving parts and the importance of shape number and materials to proper functioning  If one person was involved in making the whole device themselves it would work better for them because it had been impregnated with their own vibrations 
This is similar to the old traditions associated with making magical tools  The evidence seems to indicate that the ancient people operated some such technology to effect changes in earth energies 
The circle is one of the most fundamental shapes in nature  It is seen in the form of the sun and the full moon halo and rainbow 
It is also one of the easiest shapes to construct  Witches and other natural and ceremonial magicians still use a magic circle 
it may be marked out on the ground but the true circle is that which the magician creates mentally  It is in reality a cross-section through a sphere 
It s function is two-fold to protect against outside influences and to contain the power that is raised by the magical practices carried out within  There is no direct way of knowing whether the ancient people constructed magic circles since by their nature they are only temporary 
But we do know that the most obvious surviving monuments the stone circles take that form and we can at least speculate that they may have performed a similar function  The effort involved in constructing such circles was enormous 
They were obviously very important and it follows that their function was too  We have certain clues such as the folklore tradition of dancing at key dates and times in the year and the importance of the type of stone used some for example being pure quartz 
They were constructed carefully sometimes as exact circles sometimes as partial ellipses  There were probably astronomical alignments 
The siting of the circles were often on a saddle with a good view round to neighbouring hilltops  Conclusions from the Dragon Project suggest that in some cases the stone circle can act as a shield from outside energies 
From what we know of modern witchcraft practices we can speculate that the stone circles were used for dancing and that this was a method of raising power similar to the cone of power that witches use today which could then be stored in the stones to be used when required  This would explain the great effort expended in moving the stones long distances they had a specific quality and function 
A tradition that still survives is that of the native tribes of North America  Their medicine wheels have much in common with the stone circles of western Europe 
At least fifty are known stretching from Colorado up into Canada  They can be up to 200ft 60m in diameter and are mostly constructed of stones with a rim and spokes radiating out from a central cairn 
The Big Horn Medicine Wheel in Wyoming for example has a 12ft 4m diameter central cairn and twenty-eight lines of stones radiating as spokes  There are also five smaller cairns around the rim which have been found to indicate astronomical alignments 
The twenty-eight spokes suggest a link with the lunar cycle  With an unpolluted atmosphere and skies free from any city glow together with a naturally heightened awareness of the totality of their environment the sun moon stars and planets were an important background to ancient people 
Sensitivity to the forces lying beneath the surface seeing subtle connections between parts of the landscape that seem separate to us would lead them inevitably to what we would call a form of astrology  Rather than call it primitive I prefer to see it as direct relating what happened on the Earth directly with events in the heavens 
This astrology did not reside with ephemerides or in computer programs but in personal daily knowledge of the movement of heavenly bodies through the sky thus they were able to make the connections  In this I think is to be found the origins of and impetus behind the arrangement of sites the study of which has gone under the name of astro-archaeology or more recently archaeo-astronomy 
Both are based on the same belief that ancient people throughout the world set out their mounds standing stones and stone circles in a particular relationship to each other and to the natural features of the landscape such as hilltops and notches so that lines were set up to mark significant dates of astronomical events In the annual and other cycles  Referring back to what I see as the purpose behind the whole practice I have called it archaeo-astrology 
Perhaps the best-known example is that of the Heel Stone at Stonehenge  From the centre of the circle it marks the midsummer sunrise to which the avenue is also aligned 
The antiquarian Stukeley noted it in 1740 and it is quite possible that knowledge of this never died out locally  In Ireland it was also generally known that the rays of the sun at winter solstice sunrise illuminated the chamber of the ancient mound at Newgrange 
The relationship of this with the other mounds in the Boyne Valley area has been the subject of detailed investigation by Martin Brennan who has demonstrated purposeful and exact siting and orientation  In the early 1960s American Professor of Astronomy Gerald Hawkins analysed the positions of the stones at Stonehenge by computer and calculated the extreme rising and setting positions of sun and moon in 1500BC 
He found twenty-four significant alignments  He further suggested that the fifty-six Aubrey holes could have been used as eclipse predictors representing three cycles of the moon 's nodes each taking 18.6 years 
Alexander Thorn formerly Professor of Engineering at Oxford had been visiting stone circles since the 1930s making very accurate surveys  He found that only two-thirds are true circles the rest are flattened circles ellipses and egg-shapes all made with relatively simple geometric construction and clearly deliberate 
He also found that many of the stone circles were associated with other features some distance away such as a standing stone hillside notch or rock outcrop and that the lines to these features had astronomical significance  The most crucial test of this was at a standing stone at Kintraw Argyll 
Thorn said that midsummer sunset was observed from a small platform on a steep hillside overlooking the stone  Euan MacKie excavated the platform and found that it was artificial 
Another pattern to be found in our landscape is that of the maze or labyrinth  Most people are familiar with the hedge maze the most famous being the Hampton Court Maze dating from the late seventeenth century 
This type is multicursal in other words there is a choice of routes  It is possible to get lost indeed that is the whole point of the thing 
There is however an earlier type of maze which is laid out as a pattern on the ground either with stones cut into turf or as a pavement  It is unicursal there is only one route a single convoluted path leads eventually to the centre 
Labyrinths of this type have been found inscribed on tombs in Egypt dating to 3400BC and the same design occurs on the Cretan coins of the Minoan period though it may have originated in much earlier times  Carvings to this pattern thought by some to date from 1500BC have been found in Rocky Valley near Tintagel in Cornwall 
In Britain the tradition of turf-mazes is predominant  There are two distinct types the older pagan type and the more elaborate Christian version 
Over a hundred are known to have existed and there may have been over a thousand at various times  They were well known in Shakespeare 's time for in A Midsummer Night 's Dream Titania remarks about a period of unseasonable weather 
The nine men 's morris is fill 'd up with mud  And the quaint mazes in the wanton green 
For lack of tread are indistinguishable  Being cut in turf they need to be maintained or they would disappear completely within a generation 
Many were destroyed by the Puritans and only eight now remain  The Walls of Troy turf maze near Brandsby North Yorkshire is possibly the most ancient in Britain though it has been re-cut on several occasions most recently in 1934 when carts using the grass verge had obliterated it 
it is still being tended regularly  Julian 's Bower at Alkborough Lincolnshire is altogether more elaborate having twelve concentric circles 
It is based on the pattern in Chartres Cathedral dating from 1118  Up until 1800 the tradition survived of treading the maze on May eve 
What was the purpose behind mazes and labyrinths  The similarity of their design to cup-and-ring patterns is striking and suggests that they may have had a ritual function 
This appears from the evidence of written records folklore and surviving illustrations to have involved dancing and walking as an act of penance or more fundamentally as a means of attuning or meditation  As generations followed the pattern of the maze the earth energies may have illumined their forms in just the way that they may have done with the cup-and-ring marks and the pilgrims ' tracks 
It is natural to walk or run them and anyone who has done this will know that it becomes more of a rhythmic dance when perfectly attuned  Certainly there was within recorded memory a tradition of dancing and witches are known to have used them as meeting-places 
The act of turning of moving towards and then away from the centre has the effect of disorientation and loss of balance as in some trust games and initiatory rites and can bring the fluctuating emotions of despair hope and surprise  The labyrinth is yet another way in which consciousness can be altered 
It is not difficult to construct your own labyrinth either in stones or cut into your lawn  Essentially the method is to make it in stages in accordance with the diagrams 
Stones can be moved around until you get it right but on a lawn the pattern should be laid out with pegs initially  Another pagan survival is the maypole 
Many villages such as Barwick-in-Elmet in Yorkshire retain the tradition of erecting the pole and dancing round on May Eve and at other times  Tom Graves has speculated that the wooden pole may have been the equivalent of the standing stone a needle of wood and that its action was encouraged or primed by the performance of fertility rites 
We have seen that the stone circles may have performed some function of protection and concentration creating a special atmosphere within which ritual or other activities could take place  A further development from this idea is that of the totally enclosed chamber 
Natural caves are the most obvious some of the earliest evidence for permanent dwellings comes from caves and they also seem to have had some ritual function connected with ancient cave paintings  Bob Dickinson draws our attention to the sensitive placing of such paintings in relation to points of resonance in the caves of AriÃ¨ge in the French Pyrenees 
The ancient people seemed well aware of the qualities of the spaces and acted accordingly  People have also constructed artificial underground chambers since the most ancient times the native American kivas and the Cornish fogous being examples 
There is also a suggestion that in Britain the elaborate chambered tombs and long barrows and such structures as Newgrange in Ireland were not just used for burial but for other purposes as well  The cromlech at Pentre Ifan in Wales was known in folklore as the womb of the goddess Ceridwen and was used for initiations 
There is evidence that in the kivas at least psychoactive plants may have been ingested  These purposes are linked to the functions of the magic circle we have already seen of protection and concentration but with the true three-dimensional nature of the magic sphere revealed 
John Michell was the first to draw attention in print to the similarity between such structures with their layers of organic earth and inorganic rock material to Reich 's orgone energy accumulators  Whether acting as orgone accumulators or not light phenomena have certainly been observed in such locations 
Devereux mentions the experience of John Barnatt and Brian Larkman at ChÃ¼n Quoit in Cornwall where they saw an unexplained flickering of coloured lights on the underside of the capstone  The mind is naturally drawn here to such activities as the temple sleep and shamanic initiation practices and to modern sensory deprivation chambers 
If someone were to be left alone in one of these structures not only would the physical senses be deprived but the individual would be in a psychic atmosphere well suited to the encouragement of inspirational and prophetic experiences  The Dragon Project Trust is currently undertaking operation Interface on dreamwork at specific sites which are known to have for example magnetic or radiation anomalies 
Volunteers in pairs visit sites one sleeps and the other acts as recorder/helper or therapeute to use the traditional term  The sleeper is awakened when rapid eye movements indicate that dreaming is taking place 
The dream is then recorded  The aim of this work is to determine whether site specific images or symbols occur thus linking in Devereux 's phrase mind with the landscape consciousness and the environment 
Church crypts may well have had their origin in such chambers  This is clearly seen in the crypt at Lastingham in North Yorkshire and I have personal experience of the power of this place 
The crypt is very simple built right into the hillside  Some years ago I visited the church with a friend 
She felt such powerful energies in the crypt that she was unable to speak  She said afterwards that she had never experienced anything like it but that it was not unpleasant or fearful 
I also experienced the sensation but in less pronounced form  It was as if the energies within my brain and body were reacting to the energies within the crypt and a flowing pulsing feeling of warmth came over me somewhat similar to my feeling after a session of Reichian therapy 
I was unwilling to move for many minutes as I experienced the power present in that place  After perhaps ten to fifteen minutes the feeling faded although I also did not wish to speak and I made my way outside 
Later I took the then editor of The Ley Hunter Paul Screeton there  He got a buzzing feeling and thought the place quite extraordinary 
Afterwards he was to write If you want to get a feeling of what ley power is like go into the crypt at Lastingham church and it 'll change your life  When Ian Thomson and the current editor of The Ley Hunter Paul Devereux were doing fieldwork for their book The Ley Hunter 's Companion they visited the crypt and found that the needle of their compass maintained a strange rhythmic jigging motion 
Whether the first church buildings were Christian or pagan is probably a matter of semantics  Certainly we know from Pope Gregory 's instructions that temples existed and were reused by the Christians 
It is also certain that whilst the leaders of a community may have possibly for political expediency formally converted to Christianity most people retained their pagan beliefs and practices  Guy Ragland Phillips has shown the extent to which pagan symbols such as the Green Man shiela-na-gig pentagram and the like survive in ostensibly Christian buildings 
Ian Taylor draws attention to the church building as a continuation of the Druid groves  Christian churches were modelled upon them the pillars and arches representing the trunks and boughs of the sacred forest 
Pre-Reformation churches were painted in imitation of the colours of the woodland from which gods and elementals looked out upon the worshippers  Christian churches were modelled upon them the pillars and arches representing the trunks and boughs of the sacred forest 
Pre-Reformation churches were painted in imitation of the colours of the woodland from which gods and elementals looked out upon the worshippers  It seems certain that hidden teachings on sacred geometry form shape proportion number measure and materials were passed on into Christian times and were incorporated into much church architecture including the great cathedrals 
All the principles of sacred geometry were applied in their construction  The circle was used and round churches though rare are a distinct form 
Most churches were laid out on the basis of equilateral triangles and squares the so-called ad triangulum and ad quodraturn methods  Ad quodraturn is basically one square laid over another at an angle of 45 degrees and has been one of the commonest systems employed throughout the world 
Ad triangulum is based on the equilateral triangle the finest example in England being King 's College Chapel in Cambridge  The more elaborate geometry of the hexagram two equilateral triangles superimposed on each other the pentagram the symbol of the witches and the vesica piscis was also used 
Church architecture of the medieval period demonstrates a high level of awareness of the effect of form on consciousness  Most subjects have an established body of knowledge to fall back on but the subject of Earth Mysteries though rapidly evolving is still in its infancy and is alive with ideas and speculations on forms and energies in the landscape 
These are the living threads out of which the subject area is being woven  Many are flights of imagination and because of the very nature of the area subjective 
This does not make them invalid one should merely put them in their appropriate context  If we can see this wealth of ideas as stimulations to the imagination rather than as what we have hitherto understood as literal truth we may gain deeper insights into the true nature of our relationship with the living Earth 
Heinsch saw sacred geometry and what he called sacred geography as being part of a continuum stretching out from the structure and form of the building into the surrounding countryside  The use of sacred measure and proportion has been developed by many researchers to postulate a geometrical pattern across the land extending Watkins ' ley theory into wider concepts of landscape geometry and we have already looked at the work of Tyler Lawton and Koop in exploring wider patterns 
Leys over sixty miles long began to be discovered and soon lines of several hundred miles such as Dion Fortune 's St Albans cross began to be described while Kenneth Koop publicised the claim that Arbor Low stone circle in Derbyshire had over 100 leys passing through it  In 1970 I put forward the concept of primary leys a structure into which all other leys were supposed to fit 
One example is the st Michael Line first put forward by John Michell which runs from St Michael 's Mount in Cornwall through Glastonbury and Avebury and then north-east to Bury St Edmunds in East Anglia  Another proposed by Guy Ragland Phillips is the Belinus Line the longest line which could be plotted on the British mainland from Lee-on-Solent in the south to Inverhope in the north 
He believed that this was referred to by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth century  The trouble with all these lines is that when you get to a length exceeding about fifty miles 80km the curvature of the Earth begins to become significant a straight line on the map is not necessarily a straight line on the ground 
Also in most cases there is virtually no evidence for these lines as leys of any description let alone as important ones  Indeed the very idea of a major structure or grid into which leys have to fit says more about our own cultural environment than the reality of the landscape 
Paul Devereux has called these lines geomantic corridors where the same standards of straightness which would be applied to a traditional ley are inappropriate  Which is not the same thing as saying they do n't exist the question remains open 
Another large scale landscape pattern which John Michell has drawn attention to and which has considerable credence is the Circle of Perpetual Choirs mentioned in the Welsh Treads as being located at Stonehenge Glastonbury and Llantwit Major  These three places are equidistant and if taken to fall on the circumference of a circle can be seen to form three points of a decagon the centre of which falls at the hamlet of Whiteleafed Oak where Worcestershire Herefordshire and Gloucestershire meet 
These three-shire points are often significant and powerful in terms of earth energies  Earth Mysteries researcher John Merron has subsequently located the other points of the decagon and found them occupied by significant sites 
Some have gone much further and postulated a grid covering the whole of the Earth 's surface  Steve Cozzi defines a planetary grid system as any series of lines laid out across the surface of the Earth in an attempt to measure some particular pre-designated system of ideas correlations or theories 
There is within us all an urge to make order out of seeming chaos  The wish to discern a framework for the Earth itself is something which dates back at least to the time of Ptolemy 
Most of the many suggested grids bear little relation to each other and their generalized nature makes them difficult to apply to practical Earth Mysteries  They remain merely an intriguing possibility showing more about the human addiction to order than allowing the Earth to show her own organic nature 
Despite the findings of the Dragon Project and other workers over the years it is still too early to be at all dogmatic as to the nature of the energies at ancient sites or how they might operate  For a clue as to what might have been going on we turn again to the Chinese system of feng shui which was mentioned in Chapter 4 
Feng shui attempts to be aware of the flow of energies in the landscape choosing the best sites in terms of those energies for the placing of a house tomb or other form of development  It also indicates ways in which the landscape can be modified in order to improve the flow of energies and thus the well-being of the inhabitants 
John Michell points out  Not that the early wandering people needed any formal system of feng shui because as they lived and moved under the direct influence of the earth 's subtle energies its principles were naturally integrated in their lives 
Like all sciences feng shui is an expedient of civilization a technique for reconciling human nature to the limitations imposed on it by settlement  Not that the early wandering people needed any formal system of feng shui because as they lived and moved under the direct influence of the earth 's subtle energies its principles were naturally integrated in their lives 
Like all sciences feng shui is an expedient of civilization a technique for reconciling human nature to the limitations imposed on it by settlement  Having recognized that form is a reflection of the underlying energy pattern and that it interacts with it it is possible for the best sites to be found 
The ancient peoples were sensitive and could do this instinctively  In a crowded country like China these sites were very quickly appropriated by the emperors and others who had power to take them 
Others had to put up with less ideal locations and this led to demand for the feng shui practitioner whose skill was in improving the landscape by correct siting ensuring that nothing took place to disturb the flows of energy  Stephen Skinner writes 
Conscious effort can correct the natural outlines of the Earth 's surface to a more perfect configuration which will conserve and accumulate ch'i to the natural benefit of Earth Man and Heaven  Ch'i is naturally accumulated and may be enhanced at certain points in the Earth by the application of landscape alterations made in accordance with feng shui rules

A whole range of landscape modifications began to be developed  The shape of a hill might be altered by the construction of earthworks or even taking off a pointed peak 
Mounds might be raised or pagodas built in a flat landscape or on a hilltop plateau  Trees might be planted or earthworks thrown up to the north of a house to disperse harmful ch'i emanating from that quarter 
Ponds with gently flowing water and artificial waterfalls might be constructed or existing streams diverted to help the accumulation of ch'i  A knowledge of feng shui enables us to look at some of the ancient sites elsewhere in the world in a new light 
Were Watkins ' mark points the mounds hill forts moats and tree clumps also the manifestation of some consciousness of the principles underlying the practice of feng shui  Very often stone circles and churches for example are on very good feng shui sites as we have already noted acupuncturist'swith Castlerigg and Glastonbury Tor 
The altering of the landscape in order to achieve better energies at a site may be a simple matter like tending a spring to make sure it continues to Mow freely or planting trees at a sacred spot  Just as water can be diverted by earthen banks for the purposes of drainage or irrigation so many earthworks and structures may have had their origins in attempts to channel earth energies 
Ian Taylor speculates  Linear earthworks were the means of manipulating channelling and containing vast flows of terrestrial energy drawing them out of the central plateau area of the chalk uplands and leading them sometimes for miles towards places where they were required to boost the existing subtle currents 
Linear earthworks were the means of manipulating channelling and containing vast flows of terrestrial energy drawing them out of the central plateau area of the chalk uplands and leading them sometimes for miles towards places where they were required to boost the existing subtle currents  Legend suggests that many stones and springs have a healing power which could be encouraged by ritual 
Such legends as the White Cow of Mitchell 's Fold are a reminder however that this power can be misused and depleted  Reichian therapy acupuncture and many other healing techniques have as their basic principle the concept of energy flows in the body 
The healing process involves correcting imbalances and freeing blockages thus restoring a proper energy flow through the body  Acupuncture which originated in China is the equivalent in many ways in the human body to feng shui in the landscape 
It teaches that the human body is traversed by flows of ch'i along lines known as meridians  At intervals along these are found acupuncture points which are stimulated by the insertion of needles massage or warming with incense so as to balance the elements of yin and yang which make up the ch'i an imbalance of which is thought to cause disharmony and disease 
The flows of life energy in the body along the meridians are thus adjusted and balanced at certain very carefully chosen spots  There seem to be strong parallels between energy in the body and energy in the landscape and in the early 1970s John Wheaton put forward in The Ley Hunter the idea of Earth Acupuncture subsequently taken up and developed by Tom Graves 
If the Earth is a living being its energy flows and sacred centres correspond to the meridians and acupuncture points in the human body  Therefore the same sort of techniques as those of acupuncture might be used on the landscape to obtain equivalent results 
By analogy the various rituals that take place at standing stones cause these to function siacupuncturists needles encouraging and redistributing energy flows and freeing blockages  Beacon fires are a particularly vivid parallel with the technique of moxibustion where needles are heated by small fires before insertion in the body 
Recently the sculptor Marco Pogacnik has with this in mind installed stone sculptures in a German wood as an attempt at earth healing  Some have taken the parallels between the human body and the Earth much further and have postulated chakra points on the Earth 's surface which have specific effects in landscape terms appropriate to the nature of the corresponding chakra 
The heart chakra for example has been seen in terms of a river curving around a conical hill with a church  They are often referred to as landscape temples 
Various axes have been suggested incorporating the seven chakras  One is supposed to run from France up to Scotland 
Other more local axes in for example Northumberland have also been suggested and can be brought down to a very local level  Whatever the merits of such an exact parallel between the chakras of the human body and the landscape this way of looking at the countryside seems to enable certain insights into subtle geography to be obtained that might otherwise be missed 
Since the idea of earth energies was first put forward in the 1930s attempts have been made to show that the ancient peoples could detect such energies and that given the right conditions we can do so today  Much of the impetus behind such thinking has come from dowsers who realized that they were not just picking up underground water but something else which they called telluric force 
Bearing in mind the cautions of Chapter 5 what have dowsers to tell us about sites and earth energies  Building on investigations by Reginald Allender Smith who had detected what he felt were underground streams crossing beneath standing stones Guy Underwood distinguished three types of dowsable line in the landscape water-lines track-lines and aquastats 
He thought that these were all lines of electrical equipotential resulting from geophysical anomalies and that ancient monuments roads and boundaries coincided with them because they were laid out by a priesthood who could detect the lines  Critics whilst accepting the reality of the dowsable lines which Underwood had discovered generally concluded that they were the result of the physical features rather than the reverse 
Whilst Underwood 's somewhat arbitrary classification is now little used the patterns which he detected multi-strand lines and spirals continue to be found by those who in some cases have had little contact with his original work  Bill Lewis spent many years dowsing the standing stones of his native South Wales and came to believe that a crossing of underground streams beneath each active standing stone creates a small static electric field 
The stone amplifies this and the energy emerges from the ground and up the stone in the form of a spiral having seven coils  He found the force varied and changed polarity with the lunar cycle 
Working independently J. Havelock Fidler came up with original and valuable insights into the operation of earth energy  He found he could dowse the charge in a stone the wavelength being in the radio section of the electromagnetic spectrum that this became fixed by electromagnetism and that the germination of plants could be affected if they are on one of the charge lines 
Tom Graves could detect some form of charge on standing stones and determine their polarity  There seemed to be fluctuations and cycles from one of about twenty seconds to one corresponding to the monthly lunar cycle 
He confirmed the findings of Underwood who had noted a cycle which coincided with the Celtic calendar starting on the sixth day after the new and full moons  He also confirmed Lewis ' findings being able to detect seven bands on most large standing stones and considered that these were tapping points into a spiral release of some kind of energy that moved up and down the stone following the lunar cycle 
He considered that each band has specific properties  The fifth band affects a dowser 's balance and throws them to one side it is strongest at new and full moon 
On touching the seventh band the individual may feel that the stone is rocking or moving and feel a tingling sensation like a mild electric shock  It is also possible to release stored energy suddenly resulting in a violent reflex contraction of the back muscles 
At Rollright circle Graves was able to detect energy jumping from stone to stone  Where the line of stones breaks lines of energy could be detected moving off at a tangent 
On touching a certain stone he appeared to release a massive pulse of energy as he acquired an instant migraine which lasted for fifteen minutes  The pulses of energy released he called overgrounds 
They are dead straight and can be dowsed across country  They may correspond with leys 
American dowsers Terry Ross and Sig Lonegren found what they described as energy leys these were also dead straight could be dowsed and might or might not correspond to an actual physical ley on the ground  For years dowsers have been detecting black streams which may have been causing accidents or illness 
More recently energy leys have been found which appear to have some of the same characteristics  By locating these and hammering stakes into the ground at strategic points they have been able to divert or stop the streams and return the house or area to a healthy state 
Caution in such activity is strongly urged as it can be very irresponsible to divert or alter energy flows without knowing what effect you may be having somewhere else  Katherine Maltwood was a sculptor with an interest in folklore and mythology 
In 1925 on reading The High History of the Holy Grail she realized that the places mentioned corresponded to sites in the Vale of Avalon Somerset  She plotted them on a map 
In a moment of inspiration she found something else I shall never forget my utter amazement when the truth dawned on me that the outline of a lion was drawn by the curves of the Cary river below the old capital town of Somerset  A giant outlined by Dundon and Lollover Hills followed 
An astrologer suggested that these represented Leo and Gemini  From that moment on Maltwood gave herself to the search moving to the area and eventually finding the signs of the zodiac arranged in a circle 
She called this Glastonbury 's Temple of the Stars now generally known as the Glastonbury Zodiac  She plotted the figures on a large-scale map with the help of aerial photographs 
Most of the traditional zodiac figures were included but with a phoenix for Aquarius a dove for Libra and a boat for Cancer  There was also a great dog near Langport which appeared to be guarding the circle 
Large figures carved into the chalk hillside such as the Uffington Horse the Long Man of Wilmington and the Cerne Abbas Giant are well known but these figures were something very different they were enormous earth sculptures which could only be seen properly from the air or on a map  The whole zodiac was ten miles 16 km across consisting of effigies outlined by rivers streams roads tracks and contours with earthworks at key points 
Maltwood believed that the figures were laid out in prehistoric times as a form of temple or sanctuary using the natural forms of the landscape with a minimum of artificial alteration  She found that local legends and place names corresponded accurately with the particular sector of the zodiac where they were found 
The hamlet of Wagg for example was found right on the tail of the Dog  All this drew a predictably sceptical response from the archaeologists and historians who hotly denied the existence of the Glastonbury Zodiac 
Since Maltwood 's discoveries were publicized other zodiacs have been claimed  Lewis Edwards located one in the Pumpsaint area of Wales and others followed Kingston Nuthampstead Stanley and Holderness 
Over sixty have now been written about with a great variation in the figures as well as in size shape and orientation  But is there any real evidence that such zodiacs are anything more than the product of an overactive imagination 
Certainly earth moving to affect the form of the landscape is well-established in many parts of the world as in the practice of feng shui  It is significant that Maltwood was a sculptor since one of the skills of a sculptor is to be able to use natural form to create a vivid and living piece of art using and flowing with the natural lines 
I have a friend who has created a set of rune stones using natural flints found on a foreshore  The form of the stones each suggested a particular rune which could then be marked in the most natural way 
Perhaps a similar process might have been used to form the zodiac figures  And certainly Wildman found that the hedges outlining the Glastonbury Zodiac are significantly older than others in the vicinity dating from early medieval times 
There is however deep within all of us a natural ability to find pattern in random form as demonstrated by the Rorschach ink-blot test and research by Philip Reeder suggests that certain forms on the map tend to be picked out consistently as zodiac material  At least one well-documented zodiac has now been claimed by its author to be a conscious fabrication and the astrologer John Addey has shown how easy it is to ascribe the characteristics of the signs of the zodiac to places chosen at random in his humorous example of the Cheam Zodiac 
If terrestrial zodiacs ore the product of our own imagination we can either dismiss them as pure delusion or work positively with the same idea seeing their description and charting as a work of art in its own right  Imaginary or not they can provide a focus for pilgrimage ritual or performance art and add significance to the interaction between an individual and the landscape 
Leaving aside for the moment the question of the objective reality or otherwise of terrestrial zodiacs how can we set about finding or creating them  Firstly look at a few maps of zodiacs already published to get a feeling for them 
Then choose a likely area to search  In my studies of those which people have already claimed I have concluded that there are certain landscapes which are more fruitful for finding zodiacs 
These are areas with a rippling sinuous surface an intricate landscape structure with varying slopes and fairly wooded with rapid and small-scale change in a relatively short distance  Old roads and tracks their paths perhaps related to energy flows may predominate 
Peculiar place names remnants of a half-forgotten language which echoes at the back of our mind may occur  Generally the area may feel remote and out of touch with modem life perhaps with a tradition of witchcraft 
Ancient forests and the meeting points of three counties also seem fruitful indications  When you have selected an area keep the map in front of you 
In a sort of meditative exercise tune in to the idea of zodiacs and you may find certain place names spring out as representing zodiac signs  Circle them in soft pencil 
Keeping the pencil in your hand you may feel that you want to shade in certain shapes  It is likely that one of the zodiac figures will then emerge frequently Leo as in Maltwood 's case and as befits its astrological character 
If you get stuck just put the map away and go back to it later  Do n't worry about whether what you find is genuine or if you are making it up just treat it as a work of art 
We are dealing here with a poetic concept but one which fits our relationship to the landscape and our awareness of variations from place to place  David Geall writing about his London Zodiac says 
It is like poetry some people do not believe in its existence at all others argue over whether certain arrangements of words are poetry or not these zodiacs are as it were topographical poems a poetic geography akin to legendary history Like legends with which they often link up these poems in the landscape give an identity to a place a personality which may especially be lacking in the urban wasteland of an area like the suburbs of London so that the place is no longer just somewhere in the middle of nowhere that could be anywhere  It is like poetry some people do not believe in its existence at all others argue over whether certain arrangements of words are poetry or not these zodiacs are as it were topographical poems a poetic geography akin to legendary history Like legends with which they often link up these poems in the landscape give an identity to a place a personality which may especially be lacking in the urban wasteland of an area like the suburbs of London so that the place is no longer just somewhere in the middle of nowhere that could be anywhere 
We will fail to understand the significance of terrestrial zodiacs If we merely pick up on the generally insignificant evidence for their physical reality  It is a fundamental basis of the older religions and such crafts as astrology that there is ultimately no real distinction between that within us and that outside us 
Looked at in this way terrestrial zodiacs can have a role regardless of whether they are considered objectively real or not  Whether we discover them in the landscape or in ourselves we are imbuing the places concerned with more significance than they would otherwise possess 
In this sense it is best to see them as a modern phenomenon and as part of a Bowing movement to find significance and variety in the landscape  If they can make us more aware of the Earth and our relationship with it then their study will have been worthwhile 
For me the study of Earth Mysteries covers far more than some long-forgotten people and the monuments they left it is firmly rooted in the present and in our own relationship to the Earth  Perhaps it is inevitable when looking at prehistoric sites that attention has concentrated on artificial constructions particularly dramatic ones like stone circles 
Yet particularly as the early Christians accused the pagans of worshipping trees and streams and stones it seems likely that it was the natural sites which were looked upon as being truly important  In this chapter I want to examine some sites which hold a particular attraction for me and remembering Allen Watkins ' account of how his father had classified sites according to the four elements I have chosen representatives of three of these earth water and air 
Stone was important to the ancient people from the siting of humble markstones to the erection of massive stone circles  The type of stone seemed to matter since in many cases the nearest source was eschewed in favour of more distant origins the most famous case being the bluestones of Stonehenge brought 200 miles 300km from the Preseli Mountains in Wales 
We are only beginning to realize the significance of stone  Dragon Project researcher Don Robins has shown that stone has a defect structure which means that it has gaps which can trap electrons 
Free electrons can therefore flow in from the atmosphere and the earth thus producing electrical phenomena  Electrons can also be released by the application of energy 
This all shows that stones are very active and can absorb and give out energies  Indeed a whole body of knowledge has grown up around the uses of different types of crystal in healing and meditation and we have seen from folklore that ancient people attributed value and properties to certain stones 
As a counterpoint to the dramatic formation of major fault lines and tectonic intrusions which are major focuses for the occurrence of Earth Lights phenomena the slow deposition of sedimentary rocks builds up the character of an area in its own way  Character which is what geography is about depends at root on the underlying rock 
H each of the rock strata had their own morphogenetic field to use Sheldrake 's term or landscape deva to use different terminology might we not be able to detect these as different psychic atmospheres  To take the example of chalk some of the most memorable days of my childhood were spent cycling in the North Downs in Surrey 
Pushing my bike up those long hills and dry valleys gave me an intimate understanding of the nature of the chalk landscape  I find it difficult to put my thoughts and feelings about this into words so I will leave it to others 
The occultist Dion Fortune wrote that the best place to wake the old gods is on chalk  Comedian Michael Bentine recounted that he had asked a sensitive why some parts of the chalk countryside around Folkestone where he lived gave him a great feeling of security and peace while others made him feel uncomfortable and nervous 
The answer received was that all people who have lived in that area have imprinted their personalities on the chalk which in origin is organic and that he was picking this up As a sensitive you replay like a gramophone record everything that has been recorded on the chalk  Even the shape and form of the Downs often moulded and cut by man affects you 
Ian Taylor speaks from personal experience when writing about chalk pits  I quote him at length not only because he has drawn attention to a hitherto neglected type of Earth Mysteries site but because his experience so entirely accords with my own 
Being a poet however he is able to put this into words  Anyone of a moderately sensitive disposition who is not in the thrall of what Aldous Huxley termed their idiot monologue of petty rigmarole but who is sufficiently inwardly tranquil and open to the influence of the landscape can not fail to be struck by the uncanny quality which the chalk breathes out at different times of day under particular atmospheric conditions 
When the weather has entered a relatively rain free period but when cloud cover is moderately dense and uniform but not too low when the prevailing light is evenly spread over the landscape with no parts over bright or too deep in shadow when the wind is still or gently fitful a magic prevails everywhere upon the Wolds and it comes from within the chalk  When the above conditions obtain at dusk or dawn mid-morning or afternoon it is the same 
I have encountered it so often in a lengthy acquaintance with this landscape I know it as well as my own name  It is the essential inner spirit of the earth here immemorial and profoundly mystical and nowhere is it so potent as upon the edges of these curious chalk pits 
Every time I visit a relatively unspoilt pit I step into this magic  As with dew ponds and tumuli the edges of chalk pits are the places of greatest power and the points where the leys pass 
If you sit for long enough you can feel the energy swirling around the rim  In the bottom of the pit there is a corresponding calm it is the still centre of the spiral and an odd sense of hollowness as if you were about to drop into the deeps of the earth 's psyche and of your own like a stone down a mineshaft 
This emotional response seems to be the result of the unique yin-formation of the pit deep unconscious imagery can arise in these places and a mood of chastening solemnity will prevail  Anyone of a moderately sensitive disposition who is not in the thrall of what Aldous Huxley termed their idiot monologue of petty rigmarole but who is sufficiently inwardly tranquil and open to the influence of the landscape can not fail to be struck by the uncanny quality which the chalk breathes out at different times of day under particular atmospheric conditions

If you sit for long enough you can feel the energy swirling around the rim  In the bottom of the pit there is a corresponding calm it is the still centre of the spiral and an odd sense of hollowness as if you were about to drop into the deeps of the earth 's psyche and of your own like a stone down a mineshaft 
This emotional response seems to be the result of the unique yin-formation of the pit deep unconscious imagery can arise in these places and a mood of chastening solemnity will prevail  It seems important and fruitful to develop such an approach to Earth Mysteries this link with the very rock beneath us 
Itzhak Bentov envisages the example of a cleft in a rock where animals can find refuge  Birds start to nest there and gradually consciousness evolves into a spirit of the rock 
People begin to become aware of this and their thoughts and feelings gradually enable it to build up into a powerful tribal god  Kaledon Naddair the researcher and writer on Keltic tradition and prehistoric rock art has told how in searching for new examples of rock carvings he has attempted to contact rock spirits actual spiritual beings that inhabit sites 
They are alive can come out of the rock and can materialize  He feels that it is because he has a high ethical and moral standard in his approach to sacred sites that he has earned their trust over the years 
He can now make contact with the rock spirits in a friendly and positive manner being guided to new cup-and-ring marks some hidden 6in 15cm below the turf  Rock climbers can become very aware of the living nature of their element 
Jim Perrin interviewing the climber John Gill refers to how some hypnagogic states have their parallels in situations of action and describes how on easy routes Gill could feel himself weaving in and out of the rock peering out from the other side of its surface  There is some suggestion that psychic communication can flow more easily along strata than across them and a true link can thus be formed through the Earth between those sites on similar strata 
All those who visit springs on the chalk are thereby linked with others doing the same  This is admittedly mere speculation but it does suggest an interesting line in telepathy experiments 
Before the days of intensive quarrying natural rock outcrops were of great significance  Many folktales relate to natural outcrops which are often like Ayers Rock in Australia and Externsteine in Germany the most sacred of sites 
If natural rock is such an influence and repository of psychic memory it is not surprising that the sites where it outcrops to the surface should be considered so special  The largest rock outcrop in the whole of the East Riding of Yorkshire apart from coastal cliffs is a deposit of breccia known as Drewton Pillar 
It is also called St Austin 's Stone because of the legend that St Augustine also known as Austin' preached from it and baptized converts in the spring below  This seems to indicate that the rock was of sacred significance a long time before Augustine visited 
This is more obviously the case with the Devil 's Pulpit at Tealby Lincolnshire which is a natural rock outcrop with the tradition of being a witches meeting place  Natural amphitheatres have a powerful effect the tallest waterfall in England Hardraw Force near Hawes Yorkshire is very impressive the waterfall itself not being visible until one enters the circular amphitheatre 
Such places places where one can get close to the earth spirit would have been very special to ancient peoples  Holy wells are defined by Edna Whelan and Ian Taylor as naturally occurring springs only slightly modified by human hand 
They have the characteristic of never running dry in the longest drought or freezing in the coldest frost  They may be prehistoric dedicated to the Goddess Brighde and Diana some have been Christianized such as the many St Helen 's Wells 
The original site of St Michael 's Well Well Yorkshire  Illustration by Edna Whelan 
Some are simple springs issuing from a hillside  Others flow into a stone tank or pond or have a brick well-housing with steps leading down to the water 
There is often an intimate association between a holy well and trees Bowing nearby or directly above  These are frequently hawthorn or elder 
In these days of piped water supply it is difficult to appreciate the significance and importance of sources of pure water  Perhaps with concern growing about contaminants and residues in our drinking water the holy wells may come into their own again although many have dried up through the permanent lowering of the water table 
Holy wells also had other more esoteric functions such as healing  it was the custom to tear a piece of rag from a garment take it out to the holy well before dawn soak it in the water and tie it to a nearby tree as an offering 
This practice still occurs in places  Some were described as pin wells where in a similar fashion a pin was dropped into the well and a wish was made 
These healing properties were often fairly specific covering a wide range of ailments but particularly connected with sore eyes  Sufferers were prepared to travel considerable distances to use such waters 
The healing function might be allied to homoeopathy where very small changes in the chemical composition of the water could have very specific curative effects  The presence of earth energies adds another dimension 
Phenomena are frequently reported at springs and streams as Lethbridge noted and as we have seen in the context of visions of fairies and the Virgin Mary  A sleepy state may be induced as Devereux reports of the holy well at Sancreed in Cornwall where almost an entire group of fifteen people became languid or fell asleep 
He also has this to say  Old holy wells and springs are traditional interfaces with the Earth spirit and this can usually be almost palpably felt at such places they are truly sacred locations 
It would be a gross violation to carry out noisy or even physically energetic rituals or ceremonial activities at them  Dreaming is ideal for such sites if the dreams of Earth can be dreamt anywhere it is at these sacred waters 
Drink the water at the spring or well then curl up and go to sleep near the point of issue after invoking the anima mundi  At these sites more than anywhere else it is appropriate to visualize the Earth spirit as a goddess figure because as J.C 
Cooper observes sacred waters are traditionally symbolic of the Great Mother and associated with birth the feminine principle the universal womb the prima materia the waters of fertility and refreshment and the fountain of life  Old holy wells and springs are traditional interfaces with the Earth spirit and this can usually be almost palpably felt at such places they are truly sacred locations

A steep scramble down an ivy-covered slope leads one into a place of great natural beauty alive with the earth spirit force  Luxuriant and massive fern ground cover the visual and aural beauty of the undocumented sacred waters cascading over small waterfalls contribute to a truly magical atmosphere a positive retreat from the world above 
The most sensorily significant of the two springs is the one which emerges from the northern hillside  Reaching back into the womblike darkness of Mother Earth the waters issue forth into a small pool then over an edge being transformed into a miniature cascade

Trees are representatives of the air element in the landscape  They come out of the earth but they dwell in the air 
Each leaf makes contact with the air and anyone who has been in a grove of beech trees on a windy night can have no doubt as to the elemental attribution of the tree  Trees and tree clumps have a special attraction for me as they symbolized my own introduction to Earth Mysteries through Tony Wedd 
He read The Old Straight Track in 1949 whilst living in London and fresh from reading he took a walk across Parliament Hill to Highgate Ponds  turning there towards Ken Wood and climbing up the slope I spotted a solitary Scots pine tree among the beeches 
A mark  I called ecstatically 
It stood a clear 10ft above the other trees like a flag on top of a fortress its mushroom structure always pressing for the extra light due to its extra height  It often seems to me that the lay of the land itself reveals the angle from which a mark is meant to be approached 
So as I stood there on Hampstead Heath I felt that it was just from that point of view that the single surviving Pinus sylvestris was intended to be seen  With what delight therefore on scanning the surrounding heath did I spot barely 50 yards to my left The Tumulus 
There is only the one topped by Pinus sylvestris and encircled by a crown of thorns  turning there towards Ken Wood and climbing up the slope I spotted a solitary Scots pine tree among the beeches

There is only the one topped by Pinus sylvestris and encircled by a crown of thorns  Plotting the line on a map he found that it passed straight through Westminster Abbey the site of which was originally known as Thorney Island from a conspicuous mark a hallowed clump of hawthorn 
He began to speculate that the ley was marked with hawthorns on the lower ground pines on the higher ground and that the double planting around the tumulus was to mark the changeover  On moving to Kent Wedd began to explore the countryside and kept coming across tree clumps occupying prominent positions on or near hilltops 
From his fiat at Chiddingstone Castle which offered good views out to the north and east he noticed a clump of pines breaking the skyline  They drew the eye to One Tree Hill now forested over and from this clump at Chested he could look back over the top of Chiddingstone Castle to another clump at Mark Beech beyond 
He later extended the line in both directions and continued to plot and photograph tree clumps in the surrounding countryside gradually discovering several more alignments including a parallel system extending from the Sevenoaks Range to the High Weald in Sussex  This seemed to confirm Watkins ' findings in Herefordshire and the Welsh border of the particular significance of Scots pine as a ley mark point 
Largely as a result of Wedd 's enthusiasm I found myself becoming irresistibly attracted to the Scots pine the solitary tree as well as the clump not just as a potential ley mark point but as something in its own right I was not alone legend seems to confirm the special nature of the pine  Frazer refers to the pine becoming an object of worship during the orgiastic festival of Cybele and Attis in Rome each spring equinox 
He describes how in another ceremony an image of Osiris was buried in the hollowed-out centre of a pine tree  As he says it is hard to imagine how the conception of a tree as tenanted by a personal being could be more plainly expressed 
The pine was particularly sacred to Dionysus  A wand tipped with a pine cone was commonly carried by the god or his worshippers 
The pine cone appeared on many ancient amulets and was regarded as a symbol of fertility  Mirov and Hasbrouck mention that pines were also considered sacred in Mexico and Central America where the incense-fragrant rosin of the pine of the gods was burnt as an offering in the temples 
They add  The Buriats a Mongolian people living around the southern end of Lake Baikal in East Siberia often viewed Scots pine groves as sacred 
These shaman forests were scattered over dry grassland  Before the Soviet revolution of 1917 one approached and rode through the groves in silence lest the gods and spirits of the woods be offended

Before the Soviet revolution of 1917 one approached and rode through the groves in silence lest the gods and spirits of the woods be offended  One of the most prominent clumps which Tony Wedd found to fall into alignment with others was Gill 's Lap high on Ashdown Forest 
This was movingly described by A.A. Milne in The House at Pooh Corner  They walked on thinking of This and That and by-and-by they came to an enchanted place on the very top of the Forest called Galleons Lap which is sixty-something trees in a circle and Christopher Robin knew that it was enchanted because nobody had ever been able to count whether it was sixty-three or sixty-four not even when he tied a piece of string round each tree after he had counted it 
Being enchanted its floor was not like the floor of the Forest gorse and bracken and heather but close-set grass quiet and smooth and green  It was the only place in the Forest where you could sit down carelessly without getting up again almost at once and looking for somewhere else 
Sitting there they could see the whole world spread out until it reached the sky and whatever there was all the world over was with them in Galleons Lap  They walked on thinking of This and That and by-and-by they came to an enchanted place on the very top of the Forest called Galleons Lap which is sixty-something trees in a circle and Christopher Robin knew that it was enchanted because nobody had ever been able to count whether it was sixty-three or sixty-four not even when he tied a piece of string round each tree after he had counted it

Sitting there they could see the whole world spread out until it reached the sky and whatever there was all the world over was with them in Galleons Lap  As a description of a sacred grove with its legends character and atmosphere this is hard to better 
I believe the Druid sacred groves to have been functionally identical with and a direct continuity of ley mark-clumps  Tony Wedd discovered clumps in Wiltshire and Somerset which he thought were the remains of sacred groves based on the presence of most of the trees described by Robert Graves as forming the Celtic tree alphabet and tree calendar and which may be a significant guide to the presence of a grove 
Continuing survival becomes more likely when we consider the practice which I have described as tending  Consciously or unconsciously the trees either individually or in clumps are recognized by local people as being sacred and they are given a helping hand to ensure their survival 
This was done on certain occasions by deliberate ritual to maintain the subtle energies at a site as well as the physical features  Most work was very modest keeping the right trees and plants growing well and excluding the others in other words weeding 
It is this tradition which I suspect has been handed down over the generations in particular families but which is dying out  Our particular role may be to take over consciously and with some degree of awareness that which was formerly done on a more instinctive level 
And we had better do it quickly because the trees and clumps are rapidly disappearing through the ravages of storms and neglect  There may have been a body of people in medieval or even later times who either quite consciously or otherwise planted clumps or individual trees in the right spots 
But there may also be another process which helps to keep the trees and the clumps in good heart  The sites where tree clumps now exist may have particular etheric qualities which encourage the growth of particular species or groups of species so the natural and created landscape gradually takes on the form of the underlying pattern of energies 
The clumps and individual Lees we see today may only have been planted in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries as part of the general landscape revival on the apparent whim of an individual farmer but some clumps may have survived better than others because the energies were right and this may have enabled some of them to have had a continued existence from more distant times  There seems to be an energy spirit in each tree and each species which can be seen by sensitives 
These seem identical to Sheldrake 's morphogenetic fields and to what the ancient Sanskrit texts refer to as a deva or shining one  This latter term is used by the sensitive Dorothy Maclean of the Findhorn Community Scotland 
She found that she could tune in to the nature spirits and devas overlighting particular species and areas of landscape  The detailed instructions which were obtained were followed and the famous garden flourished in the sand dunes as a direct result 
The Theosophists claim that a grove of mature trees has an energy pattern which assists in the raising of consciousness and in this context with particular respect to pines Mirov and Hasbrouck write  Poets also shared in describing the beauty of pines 
All of us get elated and emotional as we stroll through a pine grove on a hot summer day when the old trees fill the air with their pungent fragrance  Big bonfires made of pitchy pinewood have a peculiar mystic fascination 
As we sit watching the sparks going up and as we inhale the fragrant smoke we are inclined to become philosophical or to sing nostalgic songs  Longfellow wrote beautifully of Piny odours in the night air 
We are all poets when we are in the pine woods  Poets also shared in describing the beauty of pines

We are all poets when we are in the pine woods  Dion Fortune describes the Fire of Azrael consisting of sandalwood juniper and cedar the scent from which is said to aid clairvoyance 
Many are uplifted by the scent of pines  Paul Baines has shown that this is caused by the essential or volatile oils which the alchemists considered to be the soul of a plant 
It appears that the scent of these oils can affect the etheric body perhaps creating the right atmosphere for particular states of consciousness and ancient peoples may have been aware of this  Such techniques as aromatherapy seem to operate similarly and the use of incense to achieve specific effects in meditation and ritual is well established 
Aromatherapy may be defined as the use of the natural scents and essential oils from a variety of trees shrubs and flowers for assistance in the healing of dis-ease in the individual  Scott Cunningham has developed the practice of magical aromatherapy where he uses these natural aromas for effects such as stimulation of the mind protection purification and psychic awareness thereby attaining what might be called magical states of consciousness 
Thus etheric geography opens up another possibility of interpreting the landscape in a more subtle and complete way than has usually been done  And with the help of naturalists and ecologists and some of the best are very much aware of these added dimensions to their subjects it becomes possible to do consciously what has so far remained in the instinctive realm 
The effect which pines and other trees have on the emotions of those who visit them is formalized in the work of Dr Edward Bach who developed a series of remedies based on plant extracts which work directly on the mental or emotional state of the person  Havelock Fidler the dowser found that the Scots pine acted as an interruptor of energy lines and Paul Baines speculates that the trees may thus be capable of drawing and absorbing the energy pattern of disease from those who need treatment or adjustment 
find their healing rather than bringing the remedy to the person and we may again find healing in the landscape by tending and restoring old clumps  Ian Taylor speculates that tree clumps may act as a respiratory system drawing up earth energies and releasing them through the clump 's composite aura as well as performing the same function with subtle celestial stimuli 
Seeing a parallel in Reich 's work with the human body he links the health of the tree clumps with the free energy flow of the Earth any blockages being manifested in dis-ease  Conversely the health of the tree clump could be transmitted out to the surrounding landscape having the function of the kidneys in the body 
All this is an integrative vision linking our health and state of being with that of the landscape itself  it points us towards the reasons for visiting ancient sites each has its own unique atmosphere which we can literally take into our very being 
Perhaps it is not too late by some sort of active tending to re-create the atmospheres of ancient sites by reintroducing plants which may once have been there so that they can again contribute their specific fragrance their own note which helps create the ethereal music of the place  And these will be living places whose character will change with the cycle of the seasons 
The skills of the aromatherapist and the incense blender can combine with those of the landscape architect and conservation volunteer to create once again sacred groves for specific magical and healing purposes  I leave the motor road high up on the open Wolds and take the chalk and flint surfaced green lane 
The woods crowd in on me as I make my way along the ancient track  The energy paths of every being which literally made their way along here before me have permeated the very fabric of the earth and my footsteps are well guided indeed 
I pause a moment beside an ancient grove of beech trees tended no longer now though their presence and calm remain  Here perhaps within living memory the ancient rites were enacted and may yet be again 
The trees will stay in readiness for that time  At the top of the dry valley I scramble down to the green path following the old hedge of thorns and elders pointing the way beckoning me onwards as I descend the gently curving path down the rolling hillside 
The hill edges in more closely  Instinctively I take off my shoes and feel the springy grass beneath my bare feet 
Past more bushes now I stand for a moment on the edge of a sacred area which I share with the rabbits for which it is home  I am also conscious of a silent harmony with all those past and to come who have touched the beauty and inspiration of this place 
Onwards now down the narrow sloping path under the hillside trees down scrambling to the valley bottom then turning back to make the last gentle descent to the small chalk cliff  I kneel down and drink from the renewing strengthening sacred spring 
All is silent the sun is set and as the branches of the woodland trees reflect in the gentle water of the pool I feel the whole of existence draw closer around me as my capacity for description dissolves into an experience of the infinite  I wrote the above lines several years ago about a site which I visit regularly as an indication of the sort of way in which we might best approach sacred sites in the landscape 
As I have previously stated my own belief is that Earth Mysteries should be relevant to the present day and that means we must make our own relationship with the sacred sites  To be involved in Earth Mysteries is much more than just reading in an armchair or researching in the library it means going out and becoming part of the landscape 
The landscape the Earth and her sites are our finest teachers if we can but allow them to be so  One of our problems is that most of us live in towns 
Indeed as Paul Devereux once said Even If we live in the countryside we 're still a load of townies  In other words it 's a question of attitude as much as location 
We have divorced ourselves from the landscape and the countryside and one of the implications of this is that we are apt to see our visits to ancient sites from the perspective of the tourist as a spectacle  Whilst that may be interesting and I am not suggesting that we should refrain totally from such activity something more is needed if we are really to approach the Earth and the earth spirit with any depth and with any hope of useful results 
Firstly we must be clear what our aim is  I suggest that what we are really trying to do is to re-establish contact with the earth spirit through visiting sites to emphasize pilgrimage rather than tourism 
So forget for the moment the big tourist attraction explore your local area  The sites may not be so dramatic but you will be surprised at what you discover if you aim really to get to know a particular area 
The sites may sometimes be hidden and need to be sought out and this can only happen by taking time and effort  Sites vary throughout the world and it is important to look at the local situation 
My examples tend to come from the part of the world where I live but the same principles apply wherever you happen to be  There are always sacred sites which you can find If you attune to the spirit of the area and keep your senses alert 
You may find a forgotten holy well or markstone or the remnants of a tree clump in a neglected corner  Just wander round keeping to the public footpaths and tracks seeing where you end up 
You will find the sites and you will discover the right ways to approach them as well  Visit the area several times and you will find yourself being attracted to a few sites in particular these are the places where you can meet the earth spirit 
Just allow your intuitive faculties to operate open your heart and be honest with yourself and the landscape  This is what Paul Devereux has called being and seeing 
This involves going to a site with no instrumentation of any sort no dowsing rods camera Geiger counter or even pencil  Not even any ideas 
Just go and allow yourself to be taught by the site  The site will reveal itself as a living teacher 
But first you must ask permission of the spirit of the site even if you are not directly conscious of such a being  Then you must give 
If the site is neglected you should re-establish the practice of tending  This may involve clearing out the clogged-up holy well weeding round the markstone so that it can be seen or encouraging the old tree species and companion plants where a clump is threatened 
Even picking up litter on a regular basis is a positive life-affirming act  You will realize by such actions that you have adopted the site and if you act rightly honestly and with good intentions it will thank you 
In its own way the site will respond by allowing you to share in its store of wisdom  A two-way process of healing will have been initiated 
You can develop the link further by visiting regularly at different times of the day such as dawn noon sunset and midnight at times of the full moon perhaps or the eight traditional festivals  Whether you wish to perform any ritual is up to your natural inclination but you will learn the ways of the earth spirit in a manner that you could never learn from books 
The important thing is to be open to the place let it speak to you until you become aware of its spiritual essence  Then make that place special to you by conducting a ritual in whatever form you feel happiest with 
It is best for you to follow your instincts and make up your own ritual  Certainly such things that you may already have done such as approaching the site along the right sacred path and clearing litter are valid rituals in their own right 
The important thing is that they should be non-invasive in other words play music rather than leave crystals  Treat the site with respect 
Do n't try and change things at least until you understand them and that may take a lifetime at least  Nigel Pennick refers to the ancient practice of sitting out where a person sits in the open at night in a meditative state at high places of ancient sanctity and solitary wild places of power 
It may also involve a physical pilgrimage along ancient sacred paths or wandering a wild area until one finds a good place for sitting out  I do n't mean to suggest that such things as scientific monitoring or the use of dowsing rods are inappropriate at ancient sites rather that we should as far as possible leave our preconceptions behind as we approach and allow the site if it wishes to speak to us 
And that takes time  It 's easy enough to say this I know from experience how difficult it is in practice 
The aim is to balance the left and right hemispheres of the brain the analytical and the intuitive using both in tandem  This is difficult as we are not used to doing it preferring to keep these approaches in separate compartments 
We have to learn new techniques to integrate them  One approach to sites is to look at the way we experience them through our senses 
In the Zen and Taoist traditions it was always the aim to get beyond words to the direct experience and an emphasis on the senses rather than the thoughts may be a help in achieving this very necessary state  Jimmy Goddard has made a creative leap in linking the sites corresponding to the elements through the medium of sound 
On visiting Gill 's Lap pine clump it seemed to him that the sound of the wind in the trees was very similar to the sound of a rushing stream and also to that of a roaring fire  On experimenting he found that they were all within the frequency range of 256 to 320 cycles per second and speculated that such sounds were capable of being transduced to boost the earth current 
I feel that they may also have been used to help induce altered states of consciousness  Bob Dickinson adds another dimension 
Many a time I have walked in the neighbouring church grounds aurally locating the sound of the distant well Ashwell shifting my focus to the sound of the wind blowing through the tops of an adjacent circle of Scots Pine then merging the two together in a synthesis of natural sound to create a powerful aurally based sense of place  Many a time I have walked in the neighbouring church grounds aurally locating the sound of the distant well Ashwell shifting my focus to the sound of the wind blowing through the tops of an adjacent circle of Scots Pine then merging the two together in a synthesis of natural sound to create a powerful aurally based sense of place 
He also draws attention to the power of natural forces to produce sound in the landscape such as the death songs caused by a reed vibrating in the wind  We may be reminded of the hummadruz or mysterious humming with no apparent cause which occurs from time to time particularly at ancient sites 
A friend of mine recalls an occasion in her childhood as she was walking along an ancient path when she heard the sound of thunder from the ground none of the friends she was with heard anything  We use the sense of sight all the time 
Sir George Trevelyan proposes that our seeing should be an active deed rather than a passive reception of images  This is in no way contradictory to the principle of allowing a site to speak to us but illumines a different aspect of our experience 
He puts forward the concept of the eye-beam as an instrument of perception with which we can actually touch and feel objects  The difference between this and our normal looking may seem small but it is fundamental since the mental attitude of recognizing the active deed of directing a finger of looking to touch the building is experienced as a real extension of consciousness far beyond the limits of the physical body 
The difference between this and our normal looking may seem small but it is fundamental since the mental attitude of recognizing the active deed of directing a finger of looking to touch the building is experienced as a real extension of consciousness far beyond the limits of the physical body  We have already noted the sense of smell in our examination of the effect of the subtle essences and perfumes which emanate from the trees and herbs at a site 
The sense of touch is also a very fundamental one in that it is easier to get beyond the barrier of words and thoughts to direct experience this way  We can at the very least as I suggested in the opening passage approach a site barefoot making a direct link with the Earth 
Better still if the site is sufficiently isolated we can remove our clothes completely or go skyclad as the witches say  We can again feel the wind the warmth and the cold on our body which is a new experience for many and does in some strange way draw one closer to Nature for that reason alone 
We can touch the site embrace the trees and stones  it is not too fanciful to say that they need to be loved and welcome our presence 
There can be no precise directions on how to approach sites  All we can do is to follow our inner guidance realize we are a part of the Earth and we will know

POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS  COMMENT 
Competitive markets are essential if the market system is to operate effectively  In a monopoly situation the producer may be able to use his market power at the expense of the consumer although the likelihood of this happening will be moderated if close substitutes for the product exist or if the monopolist fears entry of new but similar products into the market attracted by high prices and the profits being made 
It is relatively rare for a firm to have an absolute monopoly of the market but there are many instances where a small number of large firms dominate a market this is called an oligopoly  Such firms may act overtly and illegally or covertly still illegally but hard to detect as if they were in a monopoly situation 
Agreements or understandings could cover price-fixing and/or sharing out the available work without resorting to competition which would have resulted in lower prices  In order for the agreement to stick no single firm must break ranks encouraged by the prospect of greater market share by lowering its price or else a free-for-all may develop producing a competitive price as if the market had been operating smoothly 
The operation of such a price-fixing agreement can be seen in the way that the price of oil has been fixed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC cartel  High prices were maintained from 1974 onwards in the face of inelastic demand for oil from oil-importing countries but an oil glut in the 1980s put pressure on individual countries to reduce their prices in order to gain market share 
Despite attempts to prevent this by OPEC the price of oil plummeted in 1986  Even if there are no formal agreements to interfere with the market implicit understandings may be reached in which case the behaviour of the firms involved might in practice be the same as if a formal agreement had existed 
The smaller the number of large firms in an industry ie the more concentrated it is the more likely it is that the competitive process will be interfered with  However it must be pointed out that not all monopoly suppliers act against the public interest eg it is not suggested even by the most ardent advocate of privatisation refer to Chapter 3 that the water supply or sewage disposal industries should provide competitive services to each household the duplication of resources in these cases would be extremely wasteful to society nor do all oligopolies abuse their position 
The actual concentration of an industry is hard to assess precisely and there are many different measures of it eg if we say that the five firm concentration ratio is 85 per cent this means that the largest five firms in the industry control 85 per cent of the market a two firm concentration ratio of 100 per cent indicates that two firms completely dominate the market  In view of the existence of highly concentrated industries and if governments are concerned that large firms might abuse their powerful positions two approaches may be adopted when formulating competition policy the behaviour of the firm in the market may be considered and/or the structure of the market itself may be considered 
When viewing behaviour the firm is in effect given the benefit of the doubt and assumed to be operating in a competitive manner unless and until some cause for concern is expressed  Any complaint concerning price-fixing or the adoption of other uncompetitive practices such as the existence of measures designed to prevent other firms from entering the market may be investigated 
In practice it is often hard to detect such anti-competitive behaviour  The government 's proposals on restrictive practices published in a green paper during March 1988 prohibited all agreements between companies that distorted competition 
This was designed to replace the existing arrangements whereby restrictive agreements had to be registered centrally and it thereby brought the UK into line with the EC  The existing blanket exemptions as applied for example to professional bodies was to be ended 
The alternative approach to competition policy involves the government trying to influence the structure of the market in which the firm is operating in other words creating an environment in which a competitive structure rather than a monopolistic or oligopolistic one is more likely to exist  Those who believe that it is important to consider the structure of the market rather than the behaviour of firms argue that it is far better to deal with problems before they arise 
If there is concern that the structure of an industry might lead to uncompetitive practices then the following options are available  a 
break up large firms into smaller ones  b 
ensure easy access to the market for new firms  c 
prevent firms from amalgamating ie merging  Breaking up large firms plays no significant part in UK competition policy although in the US the telecommunications company AT & T was split up into regional competitors 
In order to ensure easy access for new firms wishing to enter the market the Restrictive Practices Court and the Office of Fair Trading try to ensure the absence of barriers to entry  However although it is possible to overcome many types of barrier there will always be some that can not be eliminated 
Entry into an industry with high fixed costs and economies of scale will always be difficult eg aircraft construction  Governments may adopt various industrial regional and fiscal policies designed to increase the incentive to entrepreneurs to set up new businesses and possibly also to reduce the red tape involved 
In view of the problems involved with breaking up large firms and the difficulties likely to be encountered in trying to control their behaviour competition policy in the UK has tended to concentrate more on the preservation of a competitive market structure  This has been done by ensuring easy access to the market for new firms by a consideration of anti-competitive practices and by investigating some mergers thereby preventing the emergence of monopolies 
These policies are carried out principally by two institutions the Office of Fair Trading OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission MMC  The OFT was established by the Fair Trading Act 1973 
It acts as a watchdog in the market and observes and collects information on trading practices  In particular the Director General of Fair Trading DGFT has a brief to monitor monopolies mergers and takeovers and restrictive trade practices 
The MMC formally known as The Monopolies Commission was established in 1948  Its brief is to protect the public interest by considering suspected anticompetitive behaviour of firms and to investigate proposed mergers 
The MMC is not able to initiate investigations itself either the DGFT or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has to refer a case to it  The MMC has no power to enforce its recommendations action depends on the Secretary of State if he wishes to follow up the recommendations 
Various criteria have been used to define the public interest including the effect on competition potential efficiency gains employment implications the effect on the regions etc  What is in the public interest and what is against the public interest there may of course be actions which fall into neither category has been interpreted differently at various times 
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of mergers  Economic theory tells us that there are three types of merger although in practice it is sometimes hard to categorize a merger as a particular type 
A horizontal merger occurs when firms producing the same product ie at the same stage of production join together  Such a merger may confer the benefits of size economies of scale on the combined firm 
This means that production may be achieved at lower unit cost ie lower average cost  This may be achieved either by spreading fixed costs or overheads eg by sharing research and development expenditure or by rationalisation ie cutting out inefficient production capacity 
On the other hand a merger between two large firms will increase the concentration in the market and may as a consequence increase monopoly power  Moreover a merger may occur as a defensive measure in which for example a firm threatened by a dynamic fast-growing competitor will attempt to merge with a third firm in order to eliminate the threat 
On the other hand a horizontal merger may be the best way to restructure an industry see GEC/Plessey merger below in order to enable British firms to face foreign competition more effectively  A vertical merger occurs when two firms at different stages of the production process join together 
This occurs between a firm and either a supplier or an outlet  Thus a car manufacturer might merge with its headlamp supplier and a brewer might acquire public houses 
The 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission Report on the Brewing Industry concluded that the operation of tied houses by the large brewers was contrary to the public interest and proposed a limit on the number of public houses that each brewer could own although the Commission 's proposals were significantly modified by the government  Such mergers do not necessarily confer great increases in market power to the firms involved and are often intended to guarantee supply of component parts or a secure outlet for sales 
The third type of merger is a conglomerate or diversified merger  This occurs when firms operating in different industries amalgamate 
Although this is unlikely to affect market power neither is it likely to confer the benefits of economies of scale although the management of the predator company may claim efficiency gains due to superior management techniques refer to the section on conglomerates later in this chapter  Such a merger may be viewed as an attempt to spread risks into different markets 
Sometimes such a merger may be partially financed by selling off parts of the company see later in the chapter  There are several different approaches which a government may adopt when deciding on its merger policy 
On the one hand there is the completely free market approach which views mergers in a favourable light  A merger may occur when a firm is operating inefficiently and new management will be installed with the aim of increasing efficiency and profitability 
Furthermore the threat of losing independence by means of a hostile merger ie a takeover is claimed to provide a spur for management to strive for greater efficiency  Although theoretically it is easy to distinguish between a merger and a takeover in practice it is less so and the words are generally used interchangeably 
On the other hand there is the approach which views mergers as highly undesirable and which doubts the claims made about efficiency improvements made as a result of mergers  The rising concentration of industry and the possible adverse effects on monopoly power are viewed as the factors of paramount importance 
Such views are held by economists who consider the beneficial effects of the threat of a takeover to be minimal when compared with the damaging effects of short termism  This occurs when a firm continually has to look over its shoulder and concentrate on short-term performance targets in order to try and maintain its share price rather than planning for the future 
In such a situation investment generally and research and development spending in particular might suffer  The third approach to merger policy is the cost-benefit approach 
This approach accepts that in any merger there will be certain benefits and certain disadvantages ie costs and that some sort of assessment has to be made in order to consider the overall impact  Although the emphasis of policy changes with different governments British merger policy has been based on the cost-benefit approach although there are free market approach overtones 
Mergers are generally viewed favourably except for a limited number deemed to be against the public interest  In 1984 Norman Tebbit the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said I regard merger policy as an important part of the government 's general policy of promoting competition within the economy in the interest of the consumer and efficiency and hence of growth and jobs 
Tebbit clarified the position and laid down guidelines that the effect on competition should be the only criterion for deciding whether to block a proposed merger although in practice this guideline was not always fully adhered to  There are those who argue that the burden of proof should be reversed and that companies wishing to merge should have to prove that the merger is in the public interest 
Thus all those mergers where the effect was neutral would not be allowed  The alternative view is that merger policy far from being too lax is too tight and that companies should be encouraged to merge in order to be able to face foreign competition 
These issues are now considered by adopting a case-study approach  A study of the GEC bid to takeover Plessey outlines clearly the conflict that can exist between maintaining competition in the domestic market and restructuring an industry to enable it to compete with foreign competition by allowing rationalisation to occur and encouraging the combined group to exploit economies of scale 
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission did not allow the 1986 bid to proceed and rejected GEC 's claims arguing that We do not consider that it is possible in the field of electronics to establish a direct link between company size and competitive performance  It was accepted however that the rationalisation of the two companies ' development of the System X telephone exchanges would be an advantage 
Encouraged by the Labour government of 1964â€“70 and the attempt of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation to restructure parts of British industry GEC took over AEI and English Electric and successfully reorganised the ailing electronics industry during the 1960s by rationalisation elimination of duplication and elimination of excess capacity  GEC under the guidance of Lord Weinstock built itself up into the largest manufacturing employer in the UK producing a wide range of products from telecommunications to defence electronics 
After various failures to takeover other companies both in the UK and abroad and following criticisms for sitting on a cash mountain GEC launched its Â£1.3 billion bid for Plessey in December 1985 partly as an attempt to counter criticism that the company had lost its way  The Ministry of Defence argued strongly against the merger on the grounds that GEC and Plessey were the two largest suppliers of defence electronics in the UK 
Competition had recently played an increasing part in the MOD 's procurement policy by the use of competitive tendering  An increase in GEC 's dominance in the market would cause damage to the UK defence industry 
There was a risk that merger would produce a company that would try to exploit the domestic defence market buying up further competition in a bid for total domination MMC report  British Telecom produced evidence which differed from that of the Ministry of Defence and which clearly highlighted the fundamental conflict of views which can occur in such a merger 
Like the MOD BT cited GEC and Plessey as its two largest suppliers  The UK telecommunications industry was fragmented and suffered because it was unable to reap economies of scale 
In addition research and development teams were widely dispersed  Hence rationalisation made sense but in addition it might be necessary to develop international partnerships as well 
BT conceded that if a merger did not take place the System X collaboration could also exist if either company purchased the other company 's interests or if a joint company were set up  In fact following the abortive takeover GEC and Plessey announced in 1987 the formation of a joint company GEC Plessey Telecommunications GPT to develop System X. The fear was that if the two companies both minnows in the international market refer to Table 2.1 failed to pool their resources they would sink further down the list of world telecommunications manufacturers 
The MMC rejected GEC 's claim that the merger would have created a company which would have sustained the UK 's position in world markets into the next century and implied that GEC should rely more on organic growth ie internal growth than on growth by acquisitions  Questions were also raised about the importance of the size of firm as a determinant of industrial performance 
On the other hand it can be argued that by rejecting the bid the MMC were more concerned to maintain the existence of competition as measured by the number of firms in the market rather than enhance the ability to compete as claimed by those arguing that a merger would lower unit costs  This latter attitude was summed up by Sir Michael Edwardes in a letter to the Financial Times 19 December 1986 
The decision to refer to the Monopolies Commission mergers like those suggested by United Biscuits and Imperial Guinness and Distillers and GEC and Plessey raises important strategic issues for Britain  In all three cases the effect would have been to create merged units of a size able to compete with the many powerful US European and Japanese companies now increasingly dominating the world scene for example the Leyland/Bedford trucks merger provides a scale that neither could achieve on its own 
It is a nonsense to inhibit that sort of synergy on the basis that together the merged units have a logically dominant position in the relatively small British market  That type of Little Englander policy displays an ignorance of commercial reality which will cost us all a very high price in the longer term 
By being doctrinaire and parochial it is easy to have a whole host of companies competing in the same home market but how many will be effective or even in business in ten years ' time  Equally important how many of them will be strong enough to avoid being taken over by foreign companies in the long run 
To trade in a heavyweight world market Britain must think big  It needs an industrial strategy founded on commercial logic rather than shortsighted bureaucratic principles 
A review of Britain 's policy on mergers is overdue  The decision to refer to the Monopolies Commission mergers like those suggested by United Biscuits and Imperial Guinness and Distillers and GEC and Plessey raises important strategic issues for Britain 
In all three cases the effect would have been to create merged units of a size able to compete with the many powerful US European and Japanese companies now increasingly dominating the world scene for example the Leyland/Bedford trucks merger provides a scale that neither could achieve on its own  It is a nonsense to inhibit that sort of synergy on the basis that together the merged units have a logically dominant position in the relatively small British market 
That type of Little Englander policy displays an ignorance of commercial reality which will cost us all a very high price in the longer term  By being doctrinaire and parochial it is easy to have a whole host of companies competing in the same home market but how many will be effective or even in business in ten years ' time 
Equally important how many of them will be strong enough to avoid being taken over by foreign companies in the long run  To trade in a heavyweight world market Britain must think big 
It needs an industrial strategy founded on commercial logic rather than shortsighted bureaucratic principles  A review of Britain 's policy on mergers is overdue 
The proposed mergers between United Biscuits and Imperial and between Guinness and Distillers are referred to later in this chapter the proposed Leyland/Bedford trucks merger is considered in Chapter 4  As a counter to this strongly argued view it is worth mentioning that it assumes that biggest is best and that the potential benefits of synergy will actually accrue 
The history of the British car industry refer to Chapter 4 which has seen a whole series of mergers is one example which shows that the potential benefits of mergers are not automatically secured  However GEC returned to the fray in November 1988 launching a joint bid for Plessey with Siemens of West Germany which valued Plessey at Â£1.7 billion 
Although the bid was cleared by both the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and by the European Commission GEC and Siemens were delayed by the need for detailed negotiating with the Ministry of Defence on various aspects  The battle proved to be one of the most long-drawn-out takeovers ever involving many twists and changes of fortune 
Plessey unsuccessfully attempted to put together a consortium takeover bid for the much larger GEC and there were abortive negotiations between the two companies for the sale to GEC of Plessey 's stake in GPT  GEC/Siemens raised their bid to Â£2 billion in August 1989 and this proved sufficient to end the long running battle 
However whereas GEC/Siemens had originally proposed that their joint bid would result in a series of joint ventures between them it became increasingly clear subsequently that the bid was according to Sir John Clark Plessey 's Chairman no more or less than a simple old-fashioned attempt to carve up one of the leading British electronics companies between GEC and Siemens '  At the same time GEC was involved in forging links with other firms by means of establishing joint ventures 
The Plessey takeover coupled with these collaborative ventures has radically restructured Britain 's electronics industry in the run up to the completion of the Single European Market in 1992  When the recently privatised British Airways BA launched a takeover bid for Britain 's second largest airline British Caledonian in July 1987 shortly after the General Election it used arguments similar to those put forward above by Sir Michael Edwardes to justify its action 
BA argued that it needed to acquire its smaller rival in order to be able to compete more effectively with the mega-airlines that had emerged particularly in the US during the previous two years  THE TAKEOVER LORD KING CENTRE RIGHT CHAIRMAN OF BRITISH AIRWAYS WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF BRITISH CALEDONIAN SIR ADAM THOMSON LEFT CENTRE 
There were five US airlines bigger than BA although BA was the largest airline in Europe and by far the largest in the UK  This demonstrates the problems faced by any competition policy which market should be considered 
Lord King the BA Chairman talked of the need to create an airline which was capable of taking on the world in an increasingly global market place refer to Table 2.2  There is undoubtedly considerable choice provided by airlines on many routes especially inter-continental routes but BA 's already dominant position in the domestic market would be reinforced by a merger with British Caledonian refer to Table 2.3 
The proposed merger called into question Britain 's civil aviation policy of the previous twenty years  The Edwards Committee report in 1969 supported the concept of a second force airline and dual designation of routes ie having two British airlines on any given route and led to the formation of British Caledonian as a result of a merger of two small independent airlines 
British Caledonian had always reminded the general public in its advertising campaign that We never forget you have a choice  The 1984 White Paper on Civil Aviation supported the idea of a sound and competitive multi-airline industry 
However there was no significant enforced reduction in BA 's route network or market share in favour of British Caledonian or other British airlines prior to its privatisation  This must have contributed eventually to the decision of the British Caledonian board reluctantly to consider a merger with the much larger BA 
The government referred the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission MMC which allowed it to proceed ruling that it was not against the public interest  This ruling in effect accepted the reality of a global market place 
BA was however to be forced to give up some of British Caledonian 's route network  This was followed by an attempt to thwart the deal by Scandinavian Airlines System SAS which made a partial bid for 26 per cent of British Caledonian 's shares in a proposed deal which also involved a complex financial restructuring package 
The key attraction of British Caledonian to SAS was that it was based in Gatwick airport a key hub airport  Great savings are possible in the airline industry from access to a hub and spokes system of routes 
For similar reasons BA a Heathrow-based airline was also keen to establish itself at Gatwick thereby making itself the dominant airline at Britain 's two largest airports  Faced with a competing predator BA raised its bid to a knockout Â£250 million and this won the day 
During the takeover battle questions were raised about the desirability of allowing a foreign airline to bid for a British airline providing access to Britain 's second largest hub  The attitude to foreign takeovers is now considered by studying the contested takeover for Rowntree 
During April 1988 Suchard the Swiss-based chocolate manufacturer launched a dawn raid on Rowntree the York-based company quickly scooping up a stake of 14.9 per cent as a strategic investment but claiming that it had no intention of launching a full-scale takeover bid  In response to this the Swiss conglomerate NestlÃ© which is the largest food company in the world launched a hostile cash bid for Rowntree which valued the British company at Â£2.1 billion 
The then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Lord Young decided that there were no grounds for referring the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission nor were there any grounds for referring the Suchard holding in Rowntree which had by that time been increased to 29.9 per cent  This therefore set the scene for a three-way takeover battle for the future of Rowntree 
Suchard responded with an offer of Â£2.32 billion which was countered by a further bid from NestlÃ© valuing Rowntree at Â£2.55 billion  This bid won the approval of the Rowntree Board which had strenuously opposed the previous bids 
Suchard was unwilling to increase its bid and sold its 29.9 per cent stake to NestlÃ© at a profit close to Â£200 million  This gave rise to speculation that Suchard planned to use these funds to launch another takeover bid possibly for Cadbury Schweppes 
The effect of contested takeover bids on a company 's share price may be seen from the 139 per cent increase in the price of Rowntree 's shares during the first six months of 1988 the best performance of any share in the FT-SE 100 index  The contested takeover for Rowntree came in the wake of a series of other moves in the European chocolate industry 
In particular NestlÃ© and Suchard had been involved in a similar takeover battle for the ownership of Cote d'Or the Belgian chocolate company during 1987  This produced a successful outcome for Suchard in preference to the much larger NestlÃ© 
The bid for Rowntree was set in the context of a shift in consumer preference away from slab bars of chocolate towards countline products individually wrapped chocolate snacks an area in which Rowntree had great strength  Rowntree 's leading brands included Kit Kat Smarties Yorkie and Quality Street and the bids for the company were based on a desire by the Swiss companies to own these brands and to market them globally 
It takes a great deal of time and money to establish a brand which explains why predators may be willing when purchasing a company with strong brand identification to pay far more than the stock market valuation of that company  This appears to be an increasingly important trend 
The price paid includes a substantial amount for the goodwill that the brands yield  Purchase of market share is seen to be less costly than establishing brands and is quicker too 
The takeover battle produced an outcome which was at the time the largest ever bid for a British based company by a foreign one  But it also raised a number of important questions which are now addressed 
1  How does the completion of the Single European Market in 1992 and the increasing globalisation of world markets affect takeover bids 
2  Does it matter that the relatively liberal capital laws in Britain allow British companies to be acquired by foreign ones whereas the acquisition of foreign companies by British ones is more difficult 
3  Does the nationality of firms matter 
The bids for Rowntree may be seen as part of a growing trend towards globalisation in world markets  just as the reduced level of import controls during the post Second World War period saw a substantial increase in world trade so the increasingly liberal attitude to capital controls during the 1980s has seen a marked increase in cross-border investment both to establish new factories and to engage in takeovers of existing firms 
Furthermore the intention of the European Community to complete the Single European Market by 1992 was seen as an additional factor behind the bids from the two Swiss companies  A liberalised single market often referred to as Fortress Europe could well create obstacles to outsiders and Switzerland is not a member of the EC 
Factors which affect the concentration of any particular industry are extremely complex  There are some European industries eg volume car production see Chapter 4 which are already very concentrated and integrated on a European basis both in terms of sales and location of production facilities 
There are others eg insurance which are neither concentrated nor integrated  As far as the consumer goods industries are concerned there are forces pushing for greater concentration and integration 
This is evident especially in the food and drinks industries both of which have seen takeover activity during the 1980s  The breakdown of traditional national markets in terms of taste and fashion coupled with the need to cope with a Europe without internal frontiers in 1992 have been the major stimuli towards growing internationalisation 
Companies with well-established brands which are the best vehicles for such expansion are likely to be increasingly few and far between this explains the keen interest in and premium price paid for Rowntree  When Lord Young the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry 1987â€“9 decided not to refer the NestlÃ© bid for Rowntree to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission MMC he did so because the effect of the merger on competition would have been negligible 
Rowntree supplied 26 per cent of the UK chocolate confectionery market second only to Cadbury with 30 per cent  Suchard supplied 2 per cent and NestlÃ© 3 per cent 
Mars Cadbury and Rowntree between them controlled about 80 per cent of the market and so an addition of 2 or 3 per cent would be unlikely to affect the competitive position refer to Table 2.4  However although the effects on market share in the short term were certainly negligible it is possible to argue from a dynamic perspective that the removal of Rowntree from the market place as an independent supplier eliminated a potentially powerful long-term competitor in world markets for the Swiss firms 
This is of particular importance in an industry in which it is hard for new entrants to establish themselves in view of the high costs of entry into the market  During the takeover battle it was suggested that Cadbury Schweppes should act as a white knight to Rowntree in order to form a strong British company able to compete effectively with the Swiss 
However this suggestion would have given the combined group a market share in excess of 50 per cent of the British market which would have fallen foul of the MMC guidelines  Various other objections to the NestlÃ© takeover of Rowntree were raised at the time 
Great play was made of the reciprocity argument  This is based on the comparison between the relative ease with which foreign companies may bid for British ones due to the liberal capital markets in Britain whereas Swiss companies are less likely to be the subject of takeover bids from abroad due to the financial structure of Swiss companies 
However it was argued that if a foreign predator wishes to place a greater value on a British company than the stock market does then that is to the benefit of shareholders  Whether the interests of shareholders are the same as the interests of the workers the company and the country however interests may be defined is possibly another matter 
Such an argument also presupposes that the market knows best where the term market today often means a limited number of institutional fund managers whose time horizons may be short term and that the nationality of a firm does not matter  These issues caused great controversy at the time of the takeover battle 
Critics of foreign ownership argue that British plants may become satellite plants or screwdriver plants involved in the low value-added parts of the production process providing jobs that are the first to disappear in times of difficulty  This contrasts with the secure skilled jobs provided in the core activities of for example research and development and product planning 
These tend to be located close to the company 's headquarters which for a foreign-owned multinational company is unlikely to be in Britain  This is known as the headquarters effect 
The issue is viewed again in Chapter 4 where the effects of the creation of Japanese car plants in this country are considered  It is however worth mentioning that NestlÃ© subsequently established a special unit based in York responsible for developing the whole group 's worldwide confectionery business 
Sir Hector Laing Chairman of United Biscuits in a letter to The Times 2 June 1988 questioned  Do we really want to go down in history as the generation which sold for a mess of pottage the finest British companies which have successfully built brand names and franchises of high repute over a century or more 
I do not believe the vast majority of people want to see British industry sold abroad for jam today  Do we really want to go down in history as the generation which sold for a mess of pottage the finest British companies which have successfully built brand names and franchises of high repute over a century or more 
I do not believe the vast majority of people want to see British industry sold abroad for jam today  However those who criticize foreign inward investment are accused of possessing a Little Englander mentality in an environment in which the nationality of companies is becoming increasingly irrelevant in modern trading conditions Kenneth Clarke Hansard 8 June 1988 
Supporters of the free movement of capital believe it to be of benefit to all countries as a means of creating a dynamic market structure and determining the optimal use of resources  The free movement is particularly beneficial for Britain which is itself a major overseas predator particularly in the US helping to accumulate overseas assets the earnings from which contribute to the balance of payments 
Lord Young argued that Britain was creating a third empire by her overseas investment  Hence any attempt at national chauvinism by acting against foreign inward investment would make it more difficult to argue in favour of British outward investment with foreign governments 
The growth of cross border mergers the increasingly free capital movements and the completion of the Single European Market in 1992 all make it essential that an effective EC merger policy is devised  Some countries have systems of self-regulation and others rely on legislation but in addition to this there is the problem of definition of market share should it refer to a particular count or to the EC as a whole 
Some concern has also been expressed about the impact of conglomerate mergers on the economy and it is this issue which is addressed next  Although British merger policy has lacked consistency and coherence it has been based on the principle that mergers which are deemed to be against the public interest should be prevented 
What is against the public interest has however never been fully defined although the emphasis placed on competition as a major theme of economic policy by the Conservative government means that only mergers which reduce competition per se are likely to be investigated  On this basis it would seem that a conglomerate merger is unlikely to fall foul of the guidelines 
This has led to the claim that British merger policy has potentially represented a Charter for Conglomerates although it should be noted that as discussed in the next subsection there has been a move away from diversification and conglomerates especially after the Stock Market Crash of 1987  Proposed mergers involving Britain 's two largest conglomerate companies will be considered in an attempt to highlight the issues raised 
An agreed merger was proposed in 1985 between Imperial Group with interests in brewing tobacco food and restaurants and United Biscuits UB with interests in biscuits snack foods frozen foods and restaurants  Imperial would benefit by reducing its dependence on the declining tobacco market and UB would gain access to Imperial 's reserve of cash necessary for further expansion 
Imperial and United Biscuits claimed that although there was relatively little overlap between the two groups except in crisps and snack food growth could be more rapid as a combined group as a result of concentrating on complementary activities eg UB s products could be sold more extensively in Imperial 's Courage pubs  It was calculated that the merger could produce Â£30 million extra profits in 1988 by creating the proposed new consumer goods group 
According to Sir Hector Laing Chairman of United Biscuits In a world where the large food companies are getting larger backed by the cash resources of very rich large partners it is not good enough to be a minnow in order to compete internationally each company has to get bigger  This is similar to GEC 's arguments for taking over Plessey and BA 's arguments for taking over British Caledonian 
When presented in this way the proposed merger appears to be based on clear industrial logic although it was considered by some to be partly a defensive move on the part of the companies involved especially Imperial which was hoping that by increasing its own size it would help to reduce the chance of an unwanted takeover from a third party  However the unwanted takeover bid for Imperial did materialise as had been rumoured from Hanson Trust subsequently renamed Hanson the largest conglomerate company in the UK which also had substantial interests in the US 
Hanson had a wide range of manufacturing and retailing interests containing virtually no product overlap with Imperial  Although the Hanson plans for Imperial were never fully spelled out it was claimed that Hanson had great experience of digesting major acquisitions and also had the ability to rejuvenate ailing companies transforming their profitability 
On the other hand it was claimed that Hanson was only interested in short-term profits rather than long-term investment and that the company was only capable of limited organic growth thus forcing it to rely on ever larger takeover bids to sustain its expansion  Faced with the two conflicting bids the Department of Trade and Industry decided that the agreed merger between Imperial and UB should be referred to the Monopolies and Merger Commission MMC as the combined company would hold over 40 per cent of the snack food market this together with a similar share of the market held by Nabisco would create a duopolistic situation in the market 
However the contested takeover of Imperial by Hanson was not referred to the MMC as it did not adversely affect competition or the public interest  The difference of treatment for the two bids gave rise to criticism that the government 's merger policy favoured conglomerates 
A revised merger proposal between UB and Imperial which involved disposing of Imperial 's Golden Wonder subsidiary thus reducing market share in the snack foods market was not referred to MMC and hence both bids were allowed to proceed  After a closely fought battle Hanson won control of Imperial for Â£2.8 billion 
Hanson has been built up into one of Britain 's leading companies over a period of twenty years based on an acquisition philosophy which involves a reduction in the acquired company 's bureaucracy devolution of responsibility to local managers a tight control of capital expenditure and a disposal of some of the peripheral assets which are not part of the company 's core activities  With the aim of keeping only the Imperial Tobacco and Imperial Foods divisions Hanson within a short period of time sold Imperial 's hotels and restaurants interests to Trust House Forte Â£190 million Golden Wonder Crisps to Dalgety Â£87 million and Courage to the Australian company Elders IXL Â£1.4 billion 
Thus almost Â£1.7 billion of the Â£2.8 billion spent on the Imperial takeover was recouped and yet the remaining assets yielded over half the Imperial profit  This confirms Hanson 's reputation for being able to spot cheap assets and sell off unwanted parts profitably but it also gives rise to the charge that Hanson is involved in asset stripping 
On the day 19 September 1986 that Hanson sold Courage to Elders the Financial Times leader Reshuffling of Assets part of which is reproduced below provided an interesting view of the company which helps one to consider the effect of such conglomerates on the economy as a whole  Hanson Trust has two main roles 
It is an industrial company managing certain assets and it is a trader in companies redistributing assets from one owner to another  In its first rÃ´le it has tended to concentrate on low-technology businesses which are managed with a close eye on reducing costs and generating cash 
Its record is entirely respectable but there is no evidence to suggest that Hanson 's skills are appropriate for the really difficult management problems like the rebuilding of the Rover Group or the strengthening of I.C.L 's position in the world computer market  To the extent that the U.K. needs more internationally competitive companies in research-intensive sectors Hanson does not offer or claim to offer much of a contribution 
This is not to denigrate what Hanson does but the limits to its managerial scope need to be recognised  It is the second role which has recently come into greater prominence 
When it attacks companies like S.C.M  and Imperial it does so with the clear intention of keeping only part of the business for its own portfolio and selling the rest to the highest bidder 
The most obvious targets are the unwieldy conglomerates built up in the late 1960 's and early 1970's which still represent an area of managerial weakness in the British and U.S. economy  Thus Hanson 's role in redeploying industrial assets can be helpful 
Hanson Trust has two main roles  It is an industrial company managing certain assets and it is a trader in companies redistributing assets from one owner to another 
In its first rÃ´le it has tended to concentrate on low-technology businesses which are managed with a close eye on reducing costs and generating cash  Its record is entirely respectable but there is no evidence to suggest that Hanson 's skills are appropriate for the really difficult management problems like the rebuilding of the Rover Group or the strengthening of I.C.L 's position in the world computer market 
To the extent that the U.K. needs more internationally competitive companies in research-intensive sectors Hanson does not offer or claim to offer much of a contribution  This is not to denigrate what Hanson does but the limits to its managerial scope need to be recognised 
It is the second role which has recently come into greater prominence  When it attacks companies like S.C.M 
and Imperial it does so with the clear intention of keeping only part of the business for its own portfolio and selling the rest to the highest bidder  The most obvious targets are the unwieldy conglomerates built up in the late 1960 's and early 1970's which still represent an area of managerial weakness in the British and U.S. economy 
Thus Hanson 's role in redeploying industrial assets can be helpful  In 1987 BTR launched a bid for Pilkington the world 's leading manufacturer of flat and safety glass which presented the arguments about conglomerate mergers even more starkly than did the Hanson bid for Imperial 
BTR was Britain 's second largest conglomerate which like Hanson had a reputation for spotting companies with undervalued assets  After gaining control of a company BTR would sell off unwanted divisions and then significantly improve the performance of those remaining 
Its share price and profitability improved dramatically during the 1980s refer to Figure 2.1  BTR had successfully mounted takeover bids for Thomas Tilling in 1983 and for Dunlop in 1985 improving the performances of each company after the merger by improvements in productivity 
Although the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry decided not to refer the bid for Pilkington to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission BTR abandoned its attempt to takeover the company claiming that this had been motivated not by adverse public reaction and the political storm created but by Pilkington 's better than expected profits forecast which indicated that the likely price required to capture the company would be greater than BTR was willing to pay  The BTR/Pilkington takeover battle focused attention on the guidelines for referral of bids to the MMC 
As BTR had no stake in the glass industry prior to the bid the proposed merger did not qualify for referral on the competition yardstick  Questions were also raised about the industrial impact of the merger 
The two companies were portrayed as representing totally contrasting management philosophies  On the one hand Pilkington was represented as a company committed to long term research and development whereas BTR was seen as a company interested in quick profits increasing efficiency by rationalisation and job losses and asset stripping 
This was contrasted with the paternalism shown by Pilkington an important employer in the north west of England concerned to buy local and to protect the local and regional economy  Certainly the local community expressed overwhelming opposition to the BTR bid 
Although many firms do continue to diversify there has been a growing mood against conglomerates and away from the notion that diversification was an automatic virtue and an inescapable trend views which were accepted by most people in the 1960s and 1970s  This has been replaced by a move which is variously described as a return back to basics an attempt to focus on the core or unbundling 
This is made possible either by divestment of subsidiaries ie a sale from one company to another or by hostile takeovers from break-up specialists who calculate that the value of the whole company as determined by the Stock Market is less than the value of the sum of the parts  The break-up specialist may have an interest in retaining certain parts of the company or he may wish to dispose of all of it to other companies 
Hanson Britain 's largest break-up specialist retains certain parts of the conglomerates which it has taken over but has as a result itself became a conglomerate as discussed in the previous subsection  The Â£13 billion bid for BAT formerly known as British American Tobacco in 1989 was the largest bid ever involving a British company 
The bid was made by a consortium headed by Sir James Goldsmith through a specially created company called Hoylake  THE HOYLAKE TRIO LEFT CENTRE JACOB ROTHSCHILD SIR JAMES GOLDSMITH AND KERRY PACKER 
The background to this bid may be seen in BAT 's attempt to diversify out of tobacco which was a mature industry with relatively limited growth prospects  Diversification centred on three areas retailing paper and insurance 
This resulted in four different parts of BAT in totally unrelated areas with relatively little scope for efficiency gains by economies of scale or synergy  Furthermore the Stock Market continued to value the diversified BAT as if it were a lowly-rated tobacco stock despite its expensive acquisitions in other fields 
However reference to Figure 2.2 indicates that the BAT share price outperformed the market during the 1980s although this outperformance was concentrated in the first half of the decade  Hoylake 's bid was intended to unbundle BAT 's tobacco core disposing of the other divisions of the company and retaining the original tobacco interests 
Hoylake claimed that BAT 's urge to conglomerate has diverted its attention from the traditional core business tobacco towards ill-conceived diversification  The bid and the general shift in mood against diversification highlights a fundamental problem which faces a company which is based on one product with limited growth prospects 
Diversification may at the time appear to be the only way that the company can maintain its profits growth and defend the value of its shares  This can be seen most clearly in the case of a company involved in mining natural resources which are in finite supply 
In the long term failure to diversify would mean that the company would disappear  Break-up bids are often financed by means of a leveraged buyout 
Shareholders of the company under attack are generally offered relatively little cash or equity but instead high yielding bonds referred to as junk-bonds  This debt is settled when the company is unbundled and parts are sold off 
During 1990 Hoylake withdrew its bid for BAT partly because of problems encountered with the US regulatory authorities when it tried to arrange a buyer for BAT 's US insurance business  However far more significant in explaining the failure of the bid was the decision of BAT to unbundle itself by selling off its paper and retailing interests refer to Figure 2.3 
Although its bid failed Hoylake 's objective of maximising shareholder value had been realised  The Guinness takeover of Distillers is studied not just as an example of a keenly contested takeover but also as it demonstrated what many saw as the unacceptable sides of takeover activity and the City of London 
Distillers the Scotch whisky firm when faced with an unwanted takeover bid from Argyll the supermarket chain in December 1985 attempted to merge with Guinness using it as a white knight ie a friendly rescuer in an attempt to thwart this move  Guinness in addition to its traditional brewing interests had acquired Bell 's whisky after an acrimonious takeover battle in 1985 
As a consequence the bid for Distillers was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because the combined Guinness/Distillers share of the whisky market was in excess of 35 per cent which was considered to confer too much market-power on the combined company  The government was criticized for referring an agreed bid while leaving a hostile bid free to proceed 
In addition questions were again raised about the criteria used to judge whether or not a bid should be referred the Guinness bid was referred on grounds of reduced competition but again this allows companies in unrelated industries to make bids unhindered  The Guinness bid was subsequently revamped to include the sale of a small number of minor whisky brands which was designed to reduce the combined market share of Guinness and Distillers to below 25 per cent 
This second bid avoided reference to the MMC and thus the way was open for a contested takeover battle between Guinness and Argyll for control of Distillers  According to the Argyll offer documents 
with Argyll 's management and substantial experience in the food and drink markets both nationally and internationally we can restore Distillers to the pre-eminent position it once occupied at home and abroad and that we have the opportunity to build Distillers and Argyll into Scotland 's greatest company based in Edinburgh and directed from there  with Argyll 's management and substantial experience in the food and drink markets both nationally and internationally we can restore Distillers to the pre-eminent position it once occupied at home and abroad and that we have the opportunity to build Distillers and Argyll into Scotland 's greatest company based in Edinburgh and directed from there 
On the other hand Mr Ernest Saunders Chief Executive of Guinness claimed that The important thing is that we are going to create a major new international brands business in Britain the first since Beecham 's in the 1950s  Distillers claimed that Argyll is unsuited for the stewardship of the Scotch whisky industry because the majority of its business is as a UK discount supermarket operator 
After an acrimonious and close battle Guinness emerged narrowly as the victor  Part of the reason for victory was that the value of the Guinness offer was higher than that of Argyll aided by the rise of the Guinness share price before the offer closed 
Although there is usually a cash offer for the shares of the company being taken over a share alternative is generally on offer  The predator company will offer x of its own shares in exchange for y shares of the target company and thus the value of the offer will depend on the relative share prices of the two companies 
Any increase in the share price of the predator company will therefore enhance the value of its offer  In an attempt to sway Scottish shareholders of Distillers and to influence Scottish public opinion which was anxious that a merger with Guinness might reduce Distillers ' involvement in Scotland Guinness promised during the campaign that the largest part of our business will be Scottish-based that Scotland would be the decision-making centre of the company and that Sir Thomas Risk Governor of the Bank of Scotland would be appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of the combined group 
However in July 1986 Guinness announced that it has not been possible to reach agreement with Sir Thomas Risk and he will not now be invited to join the board nor therefore be nominated as Non-Executive Chairman  Furthermore the company also seemed to be reneging on some of the assurances given to placate Scottish interests during the takeover battle 
Guinness was accused of bad faith in particular for failing to adhere to promises made in the official offer documents  In addition there were fears that if undertakings made during a takeover bid could be put aside subsequently then there would be calls to replace the present takeover system based to a great extent on a voluntary code of conduct and self-regulation by a statutory system 
On the other hand Risk was seen as being a possible focus for dissent on the Board as someone who would interfere with hard decisions that might have to be made about Distillers and who would therefore behave in a more executive role than had been envisaged rather than as a figurehead  Thus the decision not to appoint Risk could be seen as an attempt by the Board to carry out its fiduciary duty to the shareholders ie to act in their best interests 
In the end Saunders achieved overwhelming support when the issue was put to shareholders and he himself was confirmed as Chairman and Chief Executive and the new structure of the Board was accepted  As has been explained previously the value of the Guinness offer for Distillers depended on the relative share prices of the two shares and the Guinness share price proved to be strong during the final lap of the campaign 
However this was achieved partly by the creation of a false market in Guinness shares  Money paid allegedly for takeover fees and consultancy advice was channelled to various associates of Guinness for the purpose of buying Guinness shares thereby increasing the share price this is known as a share-support operation 
Amid the growing City scandal Ernest Saunders temporarily stepped down as Chairman and Chief Executive of Guinness and was subsequently dismissed  Saunders and three others were found guilty in a trial in 1990 on charges of conspiracy theft and false accounting 
In what became known as the City trial of the century Saunders received the longest prison sentence of five years  The Guinness Affair aroused serious public concern specifically about the government 's competition policy but more generally about self-regulation in the City leading to calls for statutory framework 
The case studies considered in this chapter indicate how difficult it is to formulate a coherent policy for mergers  In addition traditional views on the need to maintain competition within an economy have been influenced not only by the existence of large foreign companies but also by the increasing globalisation of world trade and the completion of the Single European Market by 1992 
Attention has also focused on British merger policy which has operated in a self-regulatory framework rather than a statutory one  Furthermore Britain 's liberal capital market has allowed easier access for foreigners to British firms than vice versa and this has caused some to claim that British industry is vulnerable 
During the second term 1983â€“7 of the Conservative government privatisation became one of its main economic policies  In order to understand privatisation fully since it may be viewed as a reaction to what went before it is necessary to consider the nationalisation and state enterprise of the post-war period 
The arguments for nationalisation the performance of nationalised industries and the disenchantment that developed with them in some quarters are studied  The meaning of privatisation and arguments put forward in favour of it are then considered 
The chapter finishes with a section on Privatisation in Practice  The state had been involved in the running of publicly-owned enterprises before the Second World War but it was not until the post-war Labour governments of 1945 to 1951 that there was an attempt to extend public ownership to any significant degree 
The Labour government was elected at a time when Keynesian economics was moving towards being accepted as economic orthodoxy  Keynesian policies were directed at ensuring full employment and involved government intervention in the running of the economy using demand management techniques refer also to Chapter 1 page 13 
It was believed that this intervention would be aided if the state had control of certain key industries eg coal railways gas electricity distribution which were crucial to post-war economic recovery and which were in such a rundown state that it was unlikely that sufficient private capital would materialise to rejuvenate them  Many industries had suffered from a lack of investment during the depression in the 1930s and had been further weakened by the effects of the Second World War 
Thus nationalisation could assist the government 's macroeconomic management and planning of the economy  In addition the government would be more able to pursue policies designed to rescue collapsing firms and to reduce regional disparities of income 
This was all the more important as many nationalised industries were operating in markets which were affected by long-term decline where contraction and a low rate of return on capital were probably inevitable  Thus the Labour government 's nationalisation programme was intended also to facilitate post-war regional policy 
There are certain costs and benefits which are not taken into account by the price system  Such costs and benefits termed social costs and social benefits are external to the firm and are not measured in a firm 's costs or revenue accounts 
A firm is often able to ignore the social costs imposed by pollution congestion or noise associated with its operations  However it may also be unable to reap the benefits by charging the community for the advantages gained by improved amenities installed close to its factory eg an approach road which benefit local people 
In situations where the price system does not take into account all the costs and benefits to the whole community nationalised industries operating in the national interest were directed to take into account the externalities discussed above  These arguments have been used to justify the continued operation of branch railway lines and low productivity coal pits where the costs of closure to the local economy were deemed to be too high even if the operations themselves were unviable 
Furthermore as nationalised industries were intended to operate in the national interest it was claimed that this should lead to improved industrial relations as the strife between labour and capital associated with capitalist ownership was reduced  Labour was attempting to control what were known as the commanding heights of the economy 
In addition to the economic arguments put forward for nationalisation there was also a strong political impetus as the Labour party attempted to achieve a fairer more egalitarian society in which social priorities and the national interest took precedence over the desire to maximise profits  This policy was an attempt to satisfy Clause 4 of the Labour Party 's Constitution which committed the party to the common ownership of the means of production distribution and exchange and the best possible system of popular administration and control of each industry or service 
There were in addition further arguments put forward to support and justify the policy of nationalisation and public ownership  In some industries competition is considered to raise the costs of production rather than as is usually expected to reduce them 
This is because smaller competing firms lose the benefits of size economies of scale which would have accrued to a single large firm  This describes a situation in which a monopoly appears to be the best structure for an industry and is called a natural monopoly 
Public utilities such as electricity gas water and telecommunications provided the best examples of what were considered to be natural monopolies although when technological advances are made certain industries formerly classed as natural monopolies may cease to be so eg telecommunications  The possibility that a natural monopoly under private ownership might abuse its dominant position led to arguments in favour of nationalisation and public ownership so that the state could operate the nationalised industry in the public interest 
The benefits of scale coupled with the end of wasteful competition eg duplicated research and development expenditure should also lead to a more efficient industry  After the initial nationalisation programme carried out by the post-war Labour government there was relatively little change in the frontiers between the state sector and the private sector 
Both the Conservative and Labour parties accepted the existence of a mixed economy an economy with both private and public sectors and a welfare state  This period of time has been described as a period of consensus 
Although politicians at the time would certainly not have viewed it in the same light with the benefit of hindsight we can claim that as both of the main political parties broadly supported Keynesian economics and the existence of the mixed economy the differences between them were in today 's terms relatively small  This contrasts with Mrs Thatcher 's Conservative government which has rejected Keynesian economics and has questioned the whole role of the state and the very existence of the mixed economy 
The changes in the state sector before the 1980s have occurred in a relatively piecemeal fashion  Rolls-Royce collapsed in 1971 under the strains of developing the RB211 aero engine and was nationalised by Edward Heath 's Conservative government unwilling to see such an important part of British industry going bankrupt 
This happened despite the government 's claims that it was injecting market discipline into the private sector by not bailing out lame ducks  In 1975 the Labour government was equally unwilling to see British Leyland collapse and this company too was nationalised see Chapter 4 page 63 
It would be true to say that when the Conservatives were elected in 1979 the composition of the nationalised industry sector had certainly not been arrived at by any clear sets of principles or criteria  Nationalised industries have been accused of inefficiency for a variety of reasons 
It is claimed that the lack of competition and market discipline induces a complacent attitude in both management and the workforce  In addition the possible abuse of monopoly power in any nationalised industry which is a monopoly may also lead to inefficiency 
Such a firm will have little need to respond to consumer requirements either in terms of the price of the product or its quality  This will result in limited choice for the consumer and a lack of innovation eg British Telecom phone equipment which for many years was severely limited whilst it was part of the public sector 
Whether or not these criticisms of inefficiency are valid is extremely difficult to assess and the situation is complicated by repeated political interference by governments of both parties in the pricing investment and employment decisions of nationalised industries thereby concealing their real performance  The traditional theory of the firm assumes that profit maximisation is the objective of all firms and on this basis in competitive markets high profits are a sign of success and efficiency 
Realistically perfectly competitive markets rarely exist ie there is some monopolistic tendency in most markets  Furthermore firms may set themselves several targets and not simply restrict themselves to the sole target of profit maximisation 
Therefore even for a private company high profits do not necessarily imply efficiency  A further discussion of the possible efficiency gains from privatisation follows later in the chapter 
The problems faced when assessing the performance of a nationalised industry are even more serious  When established during the 1940s nationalised industries were instructed to operate in the public interest and to break even over a period of years 
It is of course possible for a monopoly to break even at a whole series of different outcomes at different pricing output employment and investment levels  When taken with the latitude allowed by the instruction to operate in the public interest it is easy to see that with such imprecise targets it was bound to be extremely difficult to assess the performance of nationalised industries 
Government interference whether for political or economic reasons is likely to make this assessment even more difficult  In order to counter concern about the lack of guidance for nationalised industries there were two government White Papers during the 1960s which attempted to produce financial targets for nationalised industries and at the same time guidelines for pricing and investment decisions 
The attempts to improve the performances of nationalised industries were not allowed to run their course because in the 1970s governments of both major parties used nationalised industries in order to achieve wider macroeconomic targets  The increasing concern for inflation felt during the 1970s meant that governments restricted the price rises of nationalised industries in an attempt to moderate inflation in the economy as a whole 
During the latter part of the 1970s cash limits known as External Financing Limits EFLs were introduced as governments tried to control public spending  Limits on the deficits of loss-making industries eg British Rail and profit targets for the profitable industries eg British Gas were set 
However although an EFL appeared to set a clear target for a nationalised industry it was not unambiguous  Unlike in the private sector borrowing for investment was treated in the same way as borrowing to finance current spending on labour or raw materials 
Hence an EFL target may be achieved by cutting investment rather than improving efficiency by cutting costs  Similarly in those nationalised industries which are monopolies the EFL may be met simply by raising prices 
During the 1970s increasing concern was expressed about the performance of nationalised industries many of which were monopolies insulated from the pressures of the market and therefore able to charge high prices  In addition they were perceived to be inefficient measured in terms of productivity and also unprofitable causing a drain on public finances 
The disenchantment with nationalised industries and moves by the Conservative government towards denationalisation or privatisation must be seen in this context  The term privatisation is a new one and is hard to define precisely 
There are three main strands to the policy of privatisation  1 
A transfer of ownership from the public sector to the private sector  This is achieved either through the sale of a public sector firm directly to a private sector firm or more commonly by the sale of at least 51 per cent of the shares in the company to the general public 
Although this could be termed denationalisation the fact that it is not instead the word privatisation is now more commonly used is an indication of the extent of the change in thinking brought about by Thatcherism  2 
The provision of goods and services by the private sector which were Previously supplied by the public sector  This is achieved when local authorities replace directly employed labour with a private sector firm eg street cleaning hospital laundry and catering services and is known as contracting out 
It is hoped that by putting the contract out to competitive tender efficiency will rise and costs will fall  Competitive tendering is a system whereby contracts are awarded to the supplier who offers the best deal 
Contracting out by local authorities has increased under the Conservative government partly voluntarily and partly as a response to changes in the law requiring them to do so for certain activities  However opposition from Labour local authorities to privatisation measures in principle has been coupled in practice with a fear that job losses and a decline in the standard of services will occur as a result of contracting out 
3  Liberalisation or deregulation 
This occurs when markets previously served by the public sector monopolies and governed by regulations are opened up to competition from the private sector  In fact the benefits of competition could be gained without the private sector acquiring public sector assets ie competition could be created between different parts of the public sector 
Liberalisation and deregulation measures are designed to stimulate competition to improve the working of the market mechanism and to remove unnecessary regulations or controls  Long distance coach travel was deregulated in 1979 and the results of competition were beneficial in terms of reduced prices and a higher level of service on most routes 
The success of this measure led to the deregulation of local bus services in 1986 involving the break up of the National Bus Company and the introduction of private sector competition  The effects have yet to be fully assessed but there is some concern that as bus companies are no longer allowed to engage in cross-subsidisation ie direct profits from profitable routes towards subsidising unprofitable ones unprofitable routes and evening and weekend services may be forced to close 
On the other hand the service provided is more likely to be responsive to customer demand  This is achieved either through the sale of a public sector firm directly to a private sector firm or more commonly by the sale of at least 51 per cent of the shares in the company to the general public 
Although this could be termed denationalisation the fact that it is not instead the word privatisation is now more commonly used is an indication of the extent of the change in thinking brought about by Thatcherism  This is achieved when local authorities replace directly employed labour with a private sector firm eg street cleaning hospital laundry and catering services and is known as contracting out

On the other hand the service provided is more likely to be responsive to customer demand  The most prominent aspect of privatisation as practised by the Conservative government has been the transfer of ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector as in definition 1 and it is the arguments for this that are now considered 
A company which has to satisfy its customers and compete to survive is more likely to be efficient alert to innovation and genuinely accountable to the public 1983 Conservative Election Manifesto  Thus using arguments which are in effect the same as the criticisms levelled against nationalised industries it is claimed that privatisation leads to greater competition and efficiency by exposing the privatised firms to market forces 
This responsiveness to consumer demand is also likely to lead to greater choice  It is hoped that the managers spurred on by the profit motive will have an incentive to improve efficiency as will the workforce aware that the state will not be there to bail out loss-making enterprises 
Three aspects of efficiency are now considered  The increased discipline of competition in the product market ie the market in which goods and services are sold ensures that firms will be more responsive to consumer demand providing better quality goods at lower prices than previously 
In addition firms will be more able to respond to changes in demand by innovating and providing new products once they are released from the bureaucratic requirements of state control  How significant the product market discipline will be depends on the situation in that particular market 
In an industry in which there already exists a large number of competing firms privatisation is unlikely to increase competition significantly  There will be no effect on competition if a natural monopoly is privatised intact 
However it is possible in both instances that efficiency may be improved notwithstanding the reservations listed above as a result of improved managerial decision making see Managerial Efficiency below  It is generally accepted that privatisation will have the most favourable effect on competition when monopolies are broken up or when new competition is introduced 
On the other hand it is also true to say that the benefits of scale may be lost especially for a natural monopoly and also that oligopolistic pricing may not always produce-a desirable outcome  It is also hoped that the introduction of the capital market discipline which is largely absent from nationalised industries as previously mentioned will help to improve efficiency of companies after privatisation in several ways 
a  by providing the threat of bankruptcy spurring both the management and workforce on to strive for improved productivity and greater efficiency 
However for this to act as an effective discipline the market must believe that the government would not rescue the firm if bankruptcy actually did occur  Whether a government even as market-orientated as Mrs Thatcher 's Conservative government would allow an important firm such as British Gas to collapse is debatable 
b  by creating a possible threat of takeover which by forcing the management to take note of the company 's share price would force action to improve efficiency and profitability in the hope of raising the share price 
This assumes that companies will respond to a weakening share price by improving efficiency in the long term rather than by making short-term savings which might help the company 's performance in the short term known as short termism to the detriment of long-term performance  Refer also to Chapter 2 pages 24â€“5 
This threat of takeover may act as an effective discipline in some cases although it is hard to prove  However even in an era of megamergers and leveraged buyouts it is questionable whether large companies such as BT and British Gas are really likely to face predators 
Moreover if the predator was foreign it is debatable whether the government would be willing to allow the takeover to succeed such sentiments were behind the enforced reduction of the Kuwaiti Investment Office 's stake in BP in 1988  c 
by creating a need to satisfy the capital market ie by making good profits in order to gain access to funds for borrowing  In a competitive situation this would act as an effective discipline 
However as has previously been stated a natural monopoly if privatised intact may achieve high profits by exploiting its monopoly position rather than by increasing its efficiency  The performance of the industry might then satisfy the capital market even though efficiency has not been raised 
It has been argued that corporate efficiency in privatised industries has improved not just by an exposure to market forces and an acceptance of the profit motive but by the extra freedom given to managers  Critics argue that the most obvious signs of this freedom are the huge pay rises awarded by the directors of many privatised companies to themselves 
Refer to Table 3.1  Privatisation removes day-to-day government interference in corporate decision-making 
When in the state sector firms may be subjected to the imposition of economic and social objectives and in particular interference in pricing and investment decisions  Privatisation removes these constraints and also allows managers to improve the speed of decision-making essential in a rapidly changing market decisions may now be made by managers rather than by lengthy referral to government departments 
Diversification into dynamic fast-growing industries is also made possible as are moves to expand internationally  In conclusion there are wide-ranging claims made that privatisation improves efficiency although critics argue that increasing competition has not played a sufficiently large part in the government 's privatisation programme 
The behaviour of privatised industries will have to be studied over a number of years before it is possible to conclude whether the ownership of the company ie private or public or the market structure ie competitive or monopolistic is the major determinant of corporate behaviour  If the latter is the more important then privatisation of large nationalised industries intact will have little beneficial impact 
Other arguments for privatisation are now considered  A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is spread as widely as possible according to the 1983 Conservative Election Manifesto 
The Conservative government has set out to achieve this by selling council houses and also by attempting to widen share ownership  There has been a long-term decline in the number of private shareholders since the Second World War matched by a rise in the importance of the institutional investor eg insurance companies and pension funds 
The government has been keen to encourage employees to buy shares in their privatised companies in an attempt to improve industrial relations and productivity and to eradicate the them and us attitude in industry by improving employee identification with their company  Great effort has also been made to sell shares in privatised companies to the general public many of whom have never owned shares before 
Favourable treatment has been given to the small shareholder when allocating oversubscribed issues in some of the privatisation issues  However although there has been a substantial rise in the number of private shareholders in the UK many investors have sold their shares immediately after the purchase 
As most of the privatisation issues are sold at a discount there is usually a substantial capital gain to be made  If individuals restrict their share purchases to a limited number of privatised companies selling soon after purchase and not extending their purchases to other companies already quoted on the Stock Exchange then the government 's plan to widen share ownership and extend popular capitalism in any meaningful sense is open to doubt 
An article critical of privatisation in Marxism Today January 1987 comments  The idea of popular capitalism envisages a world where most people are active shareholders it is vibrant energetic risky 
In contrast the style of shareholding encouraged by privatisation is secure self-satisfied  There is little accumulation because many people sell the shares after the flotation and most of those that hang on do not accumulate others 
There is little short-term risk because underpricing ensures a handsome short term profit  In the longer run risk is minimised because BT and British Gas have been privatised as monopolies with a secure position to generate profits 
As a consequence they are safe investments  The idea of popular capitalism envisages a world where most people are active shareholders it is vibrant energetic risky

Although it is certainly true that individuals can gain a false idea about the ease of making money on the Stock Market there is also no doubt that privatisation has generated substantial interest in the Stock Market much of it from new investors  This interest was encouraged by the bull market which dominated the Stock Market during the 1980s until the Crash of October 1987 
The number of shareholders as a percentage of the adult population rose from 7 per cent in 1979 to 20 per cent in 1989 see Figure 3.1  By building up an army of individual shareholders the Conservatives may well have expected to gain political support 
The evidence for this is mixed showing that a great number of those who bought shares were already Conservative supporters anyway  Threats by the Labour party to renationalise privatised firms or to introduce social ownership dented the share prices of privatised companies whenever the Labour party appeared to be doing well in the opinion polls prior to the 1987 election 
However in its 1989 Economic Policy Review Labour committed itself only to renationalising British Telecom and the water industry as well as tightening regulations on privatised monopolies  A reduction in the role of the state in the running of the economy is as has been outlined above a major driving force behind the whole privatisation programme 
Yet increasingly arguments about the effects of privatisation on the state 's finances rather than discussion about the appropriate role of the state have come to the fore as the revenue gained from asset sales has become sizeable  The Medium Term Financial Strategy MTFS introduced in 1980 provided the basis of the government 's monetarist economic strategy 
The strategy involved controlling the money supply and also achieving progressively smaller budget deficits as measured by the public sector borrowing requirement PSBR  However the government round it more difficult than expected to cut public expenditure and this coupled with a desire to reduce taxation in order to increase incentives meant that the PSBR targets could not be met without an extra source of revenue 
Asset sales helped to provide this  Therefore the government was able to meet its borrowing target without resorting to raising taxation or cutting public expenditure or if these two options were politically unpalatable abandoning the borrowing target 
The government treats asset receipts not as a means of financing the budget deficit but instead as negative public expenditure  This has the effect of reducing both public expenditure and the budget deficit below what they would otherwise have been 
Critics of privatisation extend their concern about the government 's accounting procedures seen as a cooking of the books to the whole principle of selling assets ie capital to finance current spending  This concern was voiced most publicly in November 1985 by Lord Stockton the former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan who complained that selling off state assets was similar to a family selling off its silver and questioned what would happen when none was left 
The government response was swift  Peter Walker the then Secretary of State for Energy claimed 
The suggestion that privatisation is selling off the family silver is nonsense  The reality is that both public and private sector companies are part of the nation 's assets 
There is a great myth that the government in conveying from the state to the people an asset is selling the family silver  It is not in fact selling the silver it is transferring the silver from the politicians and civil servants to the family 
The suggestion that privatisation is selling off the family silver is nonsense  The reality is that both public and private sector companies are part of the nation 's assets 
There is a great myth that the government in conveying from the state to the people an asset is selling the family silver  It is not in fact selling the silver it is transferring the silver from the politicians and civil servants to the family 
However although the sale of a nationalised industry will provide a once-off boost for government finance it should not be forgotten that the profits of the company once privatised will thereafter accrue to the private shareholders and not to the government thereby reducing government revenues in the future  On the other hand if the profit of the company rises after privatisation whether due to efficiency gains or due to abuses of a natural monopoly position the tax levied by the government on the company 's profits might actually rise 
Furthermore once the profitable state enterprises have been sold the state will be left with unprofitable rump which will still require state funding no longer offset by the profits made by other state enterprises  It has been argued that as newly privatised companies will be responsible for obtaining their investment from the market rather than from the government the PSBR will fall 
This is certainly true but it underlines what many consider has been the undue emphasis placed on the PSBR in the government 's policy making  Private borrowing is likely to rise by the same amount and may rise by even more if the privatised company is able to borrow freely from the market rather than relying on the government 
Hence overall borrowing for the country as a whole is unlikely to fall  The word privatisation was not mentioned in the 1979 Conservative Election Manifesto 
There were plans to sell back to private ownership the recently nationalised aerospace and shipbuilding concerns and to sell shares in the National Freight Corporation to the general public  In fact shares were not offered to the public but instead the management were offered the chance to organise a management buyout 
In addition the powers of the National Enterprise Board which operated various state-owned businesses were to be restricted  During its first term 1979â€“83 the government 's main public sector policies involved achieving reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement PSBR and improving the profitability of nationalised industries 
Although a number of companies were privatised some were fully transferred to the private sector whereas in other cases only a partial stake was sold the scale of the programme and the sums of money raised were relatively small when compared to privatisation during the second and third terms  The companies involved included BP ICL Ferranti Fairey British Aerospace British Sugar Cable & Wireless Amersham International Britoil Associated British Ports and National Freight Corporation 
None of these companies was a natural monopoly and hence the concerns about competition described above did not apply although there was opposition to the privatisation proposals from the Labour Party and the trade unions on grounds of principle  Surprisingly the 1983 Conservative Election Manifesto again failed to mention the word privatisation but under a lengthy section on the nationalised industries it was claimed 
reform of the nationalised industries is central to economic recovery  We shall transfer more state-owned businesses to independent ownership 
Our aim is that British Telecom Rolls-Royce British Airways and substantial parts of British Steel of British Shipbuilders and British Leyland as well as many as possible of Britain 's airports shall become private sector companies  reform of the nationalised industries is central to economic recovery 
We shall transfer more state-owned businesses to independent ownership  Our aim is that British Telecom Rolls-Royce British Airways and substantial parts of British Steel of British Shipbuilders and British Leyland as well as many as possible of Britain 's airports shall become private sector companies 
The plan was to sell Â£2 billion of assets per annum but as a result of the success of the British Telecom privatisation of December 1984 the figure to be raised was more than doubled to Â£4.75 billion per annum by this time the revenue-raising implications of privatisation had become more apparent  Privatisation during the second term of the Conservative government 1983 7 was dominated by the sell-off of monopolies and public utilities 
The sale to the public of 50 per cent of British Telecom BT in December 1984 was at the time the largest privatisation issue and it provided a major spur to the whole programme  The sale was aimed particularly at small investors in accordance with the government 's commitment to wider share-ownership and was preceded by heavy advertising 
In addition potential shareholders were offered telephone vouchers or a bonus share issue if the shares were held for a period of three years in order to try to prevent the immediate sale of shares after the issue  Generous offers were also made to BT employees in order to encourage them to subscribe to shares in their own company 
In a further move to stimulate demand for the shares only 50p of the Â£1.30 share price was required as an initial payment  The huge interest generated in the share issue meant that on the first day of trading the partially paid price of 50p immediately increased to 93p which emphasised the extent of the undervaluation of the company the share price subsequently increased by even more 
Although there was an attempt to introduce some competition for BT this has been limited due to the natural monopoly position of parts of the telecommunications industry  However Mercury Communications was licensed as the sole competitor to BT under the 1981 Telecommunications Act with the initial aim of providing a business communications system 
Thus BT has been provided with competition in part of the market although the bulk of its services still face no competition  The Office of Telecommunications OFTEL was created to act as the regulatory body for the telecommunications industry in order to ensure that BT did not abuse its dominant position 
In particular the government imposed maximum permitted price rises on BT in accordance with the formula n 3 per cent where n is a measure of inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index  Thus for example for an inflation of 5 per cent BT 's prices were allowed to rise by 2 per cent 
This was an attempt to force BT to pass on productivity gains to the consumer  The n 3 formula was fixed for a 5 year period of time and was subsequently tightened to n 4Â½ per cent reflecting BT 's high profits and the further likely gains in productivity expected 
However although the overall price rise permitted has been fixed this does not prevent BT from increasing different tariffs at different rates provided it does not engage in Predatory pricing  BT chose however to alter its charging structure so that the domestic customer previously subsidised by the business user paid relatively more whereas business users facing competition from Mercury paid relatively less 
This together with what was seen as its neglect of its social function as a provider of services eg public phone boxes led to public disquiet about the operation of BT  However the consumer has certainly gained by the liberalisation of the supply and maintenance of telephone equipment introduced by the 1981 Telecommunications Act which has resulted in lower prices wider choice and improved products 
The British Gas flotation in November 1986 raised almost Â£6 billion and like the BT offer was directed at the private shareholders  The minimum investment was for 100 shares at a price of Â£1 per share but as the initial payment was only 50p per share members of the public could become shareholders of British Gas for a down-payment as low as Â£50 
During the years prior to the flotation British Gas had been forced by the government to sell both its North Sea oil interests and also its half share in the onshore Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset  However Sir Denis Rooke the Chairman of British Gas successfully opposed moves to force it to sell off its showrooms and other component parts of the business 
The possibility of breaking up British Gas into competing units was also successfully opposed by Sir Denis who argued that it was impossible to achieve competition in a natural monopoly  Thus the monopoly was preserved intact and British Gas was privatised as a single entity with no attempt to introduce competition unlike BT where one competitor albeit a small one was introduced 
A regulatory body OFGAS was set up with similar responsibilities to OFTEL  Amongst the other companies to have been privatised during the Conservative second term are Jaguar 1984 British Airways 1987 and Rolls-Royce 1987 
The privatisation of Jaguar formerly part of British Leyland was deemed to be a great success although the company ran into difficulties later refer to Chapter 4 page 76  The 1987 Conservative Election Manifesto claimed 
In 1980 Jaguar made 14,000 cars a year losing well over Â£3,000 on each car sold  Now the company is hard put to keep up with overseas demand and last year sold over 40,000 cars making a pre-tax profit of over Â£120m

No monopoly issues were raised by this privatisation nor were there any raised by the privatisation of Rolls-Royce  Despite the fact that Rolls-Royce is the only UK aero engine manufacturer international competition is intense 
However monopoly questions were raised by the sale of British Airways BA  Although there were limited route transfers to British Caledonian before privatisation BA was left as the dominant carrier and at the time of privatisation provided over three-quarters of British scheduled airline services 
British Caledonian BCal the second force British airline unable to compete effectively with its giant competitor was forced to seek a merger with BA as discussed in Chapter 2 pages 28â€“30  Many observers believe that this outcome would not have happened if BA had not been privatised as such a dominant carrier in the UK but others argue that this claim is irrelevant and that world competition is what matters BA and BCal were both relatively small on the world stage but might have been able to compete effectively in a merged form 
The privatisation of the British Airports Authority BAA postponed for several weeks by the 1987 election also raised worries of monopoly no attempt was made to privatise the airports controlled by the BAA as separate competing companies  The arguments for promoting competition were rejected in favour of the argument that an integrated airports ' policy was necessary and that this was best achieved by one company 
Critics supported this point of view but argued that the public interest would have been best served by a company which had remained in the public sector  The sale in October 1987 of the government 's remaining 31.7 per cent shareholding in BP Britain 's largest company showed that the purchase of shares in privatised companies need not always be the risk-free investment that its opponents allege 
The world stock market crash during the period of privatisation ensured that almost all of the BP stock was left with the underwriters  In order to try and give the market some confidence the government organised a temporary buy-back scheme which provided in effect a minimum support price for the shares only 2 per cent of the shares issued were in fact returned 
However the BP debacle was a major setback for the privatisation programme  The privatisation of British Steel and Rover during 1988 were probably the privatisations which gave government ministers the most satisfaction particularly in the aftermath of the disappointments of the BP flotation 
For many years both companies had been associated in the public 's mind as loss-making nationalised industries  Both companies were subjected to a drastic rationalisation programme 
As a result British Steel produced profits of over Â£400 million in the year 1987/88 and was privatised by means of a share sale to the general public  Rover although in a far healthier financial state than before was not considered suitable for a similar sale of shares to the public 
However the company was bought by British Aerospace as described in Chapter 4 pages 72â€“4  Thus within a period of a year two of the government 's notorious former loss-makers had been privatised 
To this was added the promise to privatise British Coal if the Conservatives were re-elected for a fourth term  The privatisation of water during 1989 created a great deal of controversy because the water industry probably provides the best example of a natural monopoly and the likelihood of any competition is almost non-existent 
This contrasts with the two large energy privatisations of gas and electricity where there are at least some areas of direct competition between the two industries the privatisation of electricity is considered next  In addition domestic water is generally charged at a flat-rate which does not depend on consumption and in the absence of meters there is no incentive for customers to conserve water nor is there any indication to the consumer of the price of the water 
It was proposed initially that the ten water authorities should be privatised intact but these proposals were abandoned  The revised scheme proposed that the water authorities now with only the functions of water supply and sewage disposal should be privatised but that a new National Rivers Authority should be created in the public sector to take over from the water authorities the regulatory functions of pollution control water conservation land drainage and flood protection conservation recreation fisheries and navigation 
Thus the government abandoned its earlier proposal to transfer to the new private sector companies the powers of regulation over river basin management previously exercised by the water authorities  The concept of an integrated river basin management approach controlled by one authority in each area was therefore destroyed by the proposals 
The need for proper regulation is greater in the water industry than in almost any other  The problems of choosing an appropriate framework for any privatised natural monopoly have already been considered 
Any regulatory system will be judged not just by its ability to provide a fair rate of return for investors and fair prices for consumers but on its ability to avoid under-investment  Vast sums of money will be needed to replace Victorian sewerage systems and under pressure from environmentalists and the EC to improve the quality of water 
The government 's proposals for regulation of the water industry announced in August 1989 provided a Â£4.9 billion debt write-off and an injection of new funds to the tune of Â£1 billion referred to as a Green Dowry to help pay for environmental improvements  In addition in order to fund the water industry 's capital investment programme a complex system of price regulation was announced 
This became known as the retail price index RPI plus K factor where K varied for different water authorities between 3 per cent and 7 per cent  The positive K factor was intended to allow water prices to rise by more than the rate of inflation in order to help finance a Â£18.65 billion investment programme over ten years 
A consideration of the movement of the partly-paid share prices of the ten privatised water companies during the three days after the issue shows the size of the gains made and supports the view that the companies were undervalued see Figure 3.2  The electricity industry had always been considered to be a natural monopoly and plans to privatise it were preceded by lengthy discussions about the ideal structure for the industry 
These were designed to ensure that consumers were protected but at the same time companies earned a fair rate of return on their investment  Public concern about the privatisation of another energy supplier British Gas as a monopoly coupled with a relatively weak regulatory framework put pressure on ministers to ensure that this situation was not repeated 
As part of the state sector the Central Electricity Generating Board CEGB owned and operated all the power stations in England and Wales and controlled the transmission grid  Twelve area boards were responsible for distributing and selling the electricity to both industrial and domestic users 
The CEGB argued that the whole electricity industry should be privatised intact and cited the benefits of an integrated generation and transmission system based on the benefits of tight margins of spare generating capacity amongst the lowest in the industrial countries and unified control in emergencies  The then Secretary of State for Energy Cecil Parkinson ruled out the creation of a private monopoly 
He also rejected the radical free market view which proposed that each part of the electricity industry generation transmission and distribution should be broken up into a large number of competing companies  This was partly due to the timescale involved the commitment to privatise during the Conservatives ' third term ruled out any complex break-up but was also due to the problems involved with the nuclear industry 
It was felt that small companies would be less willing to take on the responsibilities of nuclear power plants  The South of Scotland Electricity Board was however to be maintained after privatisation as both a generator and distributor of power ie as a regional integrated monopoly 
The details of the privatisation announced in February 1988 involved the break-up of the CEGB into three parts generation transmission and distribution  Two companies were to be formed from the CEGB 's generating activities 
National Power was allocated 70 per cent of the power plant but was given control of the nuclear programme  PowerGen was created out of the remaining 30 per cent of the power plant thereby forming a competitor to the dominant supplier 
In addition independent generating companies were to be encouraged to enter the market as competitors for the duopoly created  Crucially the CEGB was to lose the ownership of the national transmission grid 
This was to be jointly owned by twelve area distribution companies which were to be created to take on the distribution role of the existing twelve area boards  The control of the grid is vital to the operation of the electricity industry and the decision was also seen as being a good indication of the 
government 's views on competition in the industry  If the grid had remained under the control of the generating companies it would have meant that the government had accepted the CEGB 's view that an integrated network was the key to efficiency and lower prices 
Instead by separating transmission from both generation and transmission the government showed that it had rejected the dangers of efficiency losses due to fragmentation in favour of the potential benefits of competition  The National Grid was to be responsible for ensuring that sufficient power was provided by the generating companies to the distribution companies at all times 
The demand for electricity is uneven throughout the day involving certain periods of peak demand  The National Grid was charged with adopting a merit order of power stations based on efficiency in order to fix which power stations were to be used at which times 
This was seen as being a major spur to improving efficiency for the generating companies  Despite the moves outlined above the need for regulation in the electricity industry remains of crucial importance 
The construction of an appropriate regulatory framework is extremely complex and this has been borne out by the US experience  At the time of writing full proposals have yet to be announced 
It would be possible to institute a retail price index minus x formula designed to encourage efficiency and to ensure that productivity gains are passed on to the consumer  The questions of whether to allow increases in the industry 's import fuel bills to be passed on to the consumer and how to treat investment need to be addressed 
If the regulatory framework permits the transfer to customers of the whole cost of rising fuel bills but makes no allowance for investment generating companies would have an incentive to build the cheapest possible power plants which are likely to be costly and inefficient in the use of fuel  In an embarrassing retreat the government was forced to withdraw the nuclear power stations from its proposed electricity privatisation during 1989 in a blow both to its privatisation and nuclear power programmes 
For years the economics of the nuclear power industry were concealed within the overall accounts of the public sector electricity industry  However during the run up to privatisation it was established that the running costs of the nuclear power stations were higher than was previously believed and that in addition the costs of decommissioning these power stations and reprocessing the spent fuel were both high and uncertain 
The costs and risks involved indicated that it would have been very difficult to convince investors to invest in the generating company National Power if it had been responsible for the nuclear power stations even though it had been given control of the majority of the generating capacity in order to compensate for this  Nuclear Electric a third generating company was to be established to take control of the nuclear power stations and to remain in the public sector 
A list of privatisations between 1979 and 1990 together with the proceeds from privatisation are contained in Table 3.2  Privatisation has become a major plank of the Conservative government 's programme 
Supporters argue that privatisation increases efficiency widens share ownership and increases consumer choice  Opponents argue that it is a cynical way of both raising extra government revenues and also buying votes 
In addition whenever a natural monopoly is transferred intact to the private sector there is a danger that the consumer will suffer  In order to meet this danger the government has introduced a regulatory framework in some cases 
It is extremely difficult to provide a clear conclusion about the success of privatisation  For example British Telecom 's service has received heavy criticism since privatisation but how much of this failure to provide an adequate service is due to post-privatisation behaviour as opposed to decisions perhaps inadequate investment made beforehand 
However if success can be measured by the number of governments in all parts of the world now privatising their state-owned assets then privatisation can be seen as a great success  The motor industry has been chosen as a case study to consider various industrial issues that have affected the British economy during the period of Conservative government 
In order to do this the background to this period is also briefly considered  The chapter investigates 
a  the reasons for the decline of the British motor industry 
b  the government 's response to the decline and prospects for the future 
c  the need to exploit economies of scale 
d  the role of foreign investment and the implications of foreign ownership with particular reference to Japan 
e  the trend towards greater collaboration and cross-border mergers 
f  the privatisation of Leyland/Rover 
g  the implications of the EC completion of the Internal Market in 1992 
Encouraged by the Labour government 's attempts to restructure parts of British manufacturing industry see Chapter 2 pages 25â€“6 concerning the formation of GEC the British Leyland Motor Corporation BLMC was formed in 1968 as a result of the merger of BMC and Leyland  This followed a succession of smaller mergers during the previous decade as the once dominant but then struggling independent British car makers joined together in an attempt to gain economies of scale and to maintain their market share in the face of fierce international competition 
In 1930 the combined UK market share obtained by Austin and Morris later both to be parts of BLMC was approximately 60 per cent  However throughout the 1960s and 1970s the company was plagued by poor industrial relations and inadequate investment 
In addition there was no serious attempt to rationalise the model range thus too many different mainly outdated models were produced and insufficient profit was generated to develop new products  For many the performance of the company epitomised the problems faced by British industry 
On the verge of bankruptcy in December 1974 Leyland approached the recently elected Labour government for assistance  This was provided as a consequence of the Ryder Report which recommended a substantial injection of public funds in April 1975 
At that time Mr Tony Benn was Industry Secretary and the Labour government was attempting to increase state involvement in private industry by means of the National Enterprise Board NEB  However it became increasingly obvious during the next two years that the Ryder Report had been over optimistic about the market share of Leyland and that even large injections of capital were insufficient to overcome the problems of poor labour relations low productivity and entrenched attitudes 
Critics of the report saw it as an old-style socialist attempt to plan the future of an industry without due regard to market forces  Sir Michael Edwardes was appointed to the task of rescuing the company in 1977 and in the next five years attempted to reduce excessive centralisation in the company and to improve efficiency which involved many plant closures and redundancies 
Although appointed under a Labour government he was in every sense a Thatcherite manager  The drive to increase productivity resulted in a series of conflicts with the unions as Sir Michael sought the right to manage 
He often went over the head of union officials appealing directly to the workforce and to a great extent the workforce accepted his proposals thereby improving productivity and dramatically reducing the days lost through industrial disputes  After unsuccessful attempts to merge or collaborate with Renault and certain other European manufacturers in 1978â€“9 Leyland announced proposals to collaborate with Honda in 1979 
The management of the company had concluded it was too small to survive on its own  The European car industry has increasingly become dominated by a small number of large companies 
The main reason for this is that large production runs are necessary in order to cover the massive fixed costs involved in developing new cars or major components eg engines and gearboxes  Smaller companies unable to compete effectively and unable to generate the profits necessary for future investment have tended to stagnate sometimes propped up by national governments 
Mergers and collaborative ventures with one of the larger companies have been common  The Big Six companies in Europe comprise General Motors Opel/Vauxhall and Ford both US-owned multinationals Fiat Volkswagen Renault and Peugeot 
No British-owned company is in this list although General Motors Ford and Peugeot have car assembly facilities in the UK  At the other extreme a number of specialist car producers have come to dominate the luxury end of the car market 
The main companies are Daimler-Benz BMW Porsche Jaguar Volvo and Saab  In this sector of the market profits per car sold are generally considerably higher than in the mass-produced car market 
Companies such as Rover Alfa-Romeo and Seat became increasingly caught in no man 's land insufficiently large to compete on effective terms with the Big Six and yet unable to gain a secure niche in the market which would enable them to compete with the luxury car makers  After a complex series of name changes Rover had replaced Leyland as the name of the whole company 
All three companies mentioned above were involved during 1986 in merger negotiations with one or other of the Big Six  Such moves some between private companies and others inspired by governments can be seen as a further restructuring of the European car industry faced with the increasing challenge of Japanese and other Far Eastern competition 
Both Alfa-Romeo and Seat found European solutions to their problems with Fiat and Volkswagen respectively  These solutions together with the unsuccessful moves to sell various parts of Rover to US multinationals and Rover 's subsequent return to the private sector are considered later in the chapter 
West European car sales for 1989 indicate the gap between the production level of Rover and the Big Six see Table 4.1  The Japanese motor industry achieved spectacular export growth during the 1960s and 1970s but has started to locate production facilities abroad in recent years 
This has been prompted by the increasing value of the yen which has squeezed profit margins on cars exported and also by the growing threat of protectionism in many countries  The UK negotiated a Voluntary Export Restraint VER sometimes known as Voluntary Restraint Agreement VRA with Japan limiting Japan 's share of the UK market to 11 per cent and some other European countries eg France and Italy have even more stringent controls 
VERs are designed to protect the domestic car industry but critics argue that consumers suffer as some are prevented from buying the car of their choice and that the prices of Japanese cars are higher than they would otherwise have been thus raising Japanese profit margins ie profit per car sold  In the absence of keen pricing from the Japanese the competitive element in the UK market is reduced and therefore car prices are generally higher than they would be if market forces were allowed to operate freely 
Japan 's three largest car companies Toyota Nissan and Honda have each announced plans to establish assembly plants in Britain with Honda having a collaborative agreement and other close links with Rover see Figure 4.1  The effects of Japanese involvement in the British car industry are now considered 
Nissan Japan 's second largest car manufacturer put forward proposals in 1981 to establish a plant capable of producing 200,000 cars a year by 1986  However after doubts had been expressed by certain of Nissan 's executives this proposal was drastically scaled-down 
The factory which opened in 1986 at Washington Tyne and Wear was capable of assembling 24,000 cars only and these were to be constructed from kits imported from Japan  The local content of those cars where local means European not necessarily British was approximately 20 per cent and only 500 jobs were created 
Under Phase 2 of the scheme Nissan proposed to increase output to 100,000 cars a year by 1991 with local content rising above 60 per cent during 1988 and subsequently rising to 80 per cent  As a result an additional 2,200 jobs would follow 
Plans to start exporting the Nissan Bluebird to continental Europe were announced in 1988 and the production target was raised to 200,000 cars a year for 1992/93  These plans were opposed by the French and Italians who questioned the European credentials of the cars 
The Nissan plant although smaller than the one originally envisaged was welcomed by the depressed North East of England  Not only would jobs be provided directly but there would also be additional employment generated in the components industry and in ancillary services 
Although the amount of employment created by Nissan was relatively small compared to the huge loss of manufacturing jobs caused by de-industrialisation in the North East the investment was seen as a sign of hope possibly leading to involvement by other Japanese companies  A single-union agreement was negotiated with the Amalgamated Engineering Union AEU which effectively provided a no-strike deal for Nissan 
If negotiation fails to provide an agreement acceptable to both sides then a dispute is referred to pendulum arbitration  In this case the arbitrator has to accept either the position of the management or that of the workforce the purpose of such arbitration is to encourage moderation by discouraging unrealistically high pay claims from the workforce and unrealistically low offers from the management in the expectation that a traditional arbitrator would eventually split the difference between the two positions 
In view of the high unemployment existing in the North East of England Nissan has been able to select carefully whom to recruit  Job flexibility was an important feature and was intended to reduce demarcation disputes ie disputes about who does what and add to the smooth running of the plant 
Concern has however been expressed about the overall impact of the Nissan plant on the rest of the motor industry and on the economy as a whole  The effect of Japanese competition in some industries in the past has been to reduce drastically the size of those industries and in some cases eg motor cycles virtually eliminate the industries altogether 
Thus it is argued that in order to provide protection for the UK car industry the VER negotiated with the Japanese to limit car imports into the UK should be tightened and the Japanese should certainly not be allowed to establish production facilities in Britain whereby the VER might be avoided  However assurances have been received that the level of the local content of the Nissan cars would rise to 80 per cent and this would appear to convert the existing kit assembly plant into a full scale production facility 
Nonetheless there is still concern about exactly how the 80 per cent is to be measured  If the high technology components continue to be produced in Japan there will be relatively little scope for research and development in the UK and the plant will remain a satellite or screwdriver plant 
Although the Nissan investment will undoubtedly create employment there is argument about the net employment effect this involves a consideration of the jobs lost indirectly as a consequence of the establishment of the factory  This analysis falls into two parts 
Firstly there are fears for the UK components industry and worries that even when the 80 per cent local ie European content has been reached Nissan will be less willing to buy British components than other established carmakers  Secondly it is necessary to consider the effect on the other car-producing manufacturers in the UK 
This will depend whether a the Nissan cars are for export to the EC b they are sold in the UK to customers who would otherwise have purchased an imported car or c they are sold in the UK to customers who would otherwise have bought a car produced in the UK by one of the other UK manufacturers  In the first two cases a and b there will be a beneficial effect on output employment and balance of payments whereas in the third case there will be no overall positive effect on any of those variables it may even result in a negative effect if Nissan 's components are less British than those of other UK-based manufacturers 
Thus if Nissan gains market share at the expense of cars which would have been manufactured in the UK anyway problems may be caused for other companies especially Rover which relies principally on the UK market for its sales  These concerns clearly were not shared by Mrs Thatcher who welcomed the announcement of the second phase of the Washington development in September 1986 This is good news for the North East and for Britain and makes Nissan a fully-fledged UK car manufacturer and a major exporter 
When Toyota Japan 's largest automotive group announced in 1989 its intention to construct a plant at Burnaston near Derby the reaction to it was far more favourable than that received by Nissan eight years previously  This was largely a result of the widely-perceived success of the Nissan plant 
The Â£700 million investment was the largest single investment by a Japanese company in Europe  Plans were announced to produce 100,000 cars a year by 1995 rising to 200,000 cars a year by 1997/8 
The high subsidies offered by the UK government to Nissan and by other European governments to encourage Japanese investment gave rise to fears that the Europeans were engaging in beggar-my-neighbour subsidy policies which would benefit the Japanese and give them an unfair competitive advantage when compared to existing producers  However unlike Nissan Toyota received no state aid towards its investment as Derbyshire was not an eligible area 
Under 1989 EC guidelines state aid provided to the motor industry has to be cleared by the European Commission and the generous level of aid provided to Nissan in Tyne and Wear would not have been available had Toyota decided to invest there instead  Shortly afterwards Toyota announced plans to establish an engine plant in Shotton North Wales and this was seen as a further sign of confidence in the British economy 
Cooperation between Rover and Honda has become increasingly close since links were forged in 1979  The initial agreement made was a licensing agreement whereby Rover then known as BL assembled the Honda Ballade from 1981 onwards with limited alterations and sold it as the Triumph Acclaim 
This served as a stop-gap measure intended to fill the gap in Rover 's range before the introduction of the Maestro and Montego models  The Acclaim proved so successful that production was continued after the introduction of these cars although a restyled model was named the Rover 200 as part of Rover 's plan to improve the image of the company by concentrating on fewer marques 
Whereas the Triumph Acclaim/Rover 200 was a Japanese car built under licence in the UK the second venture between Rover and Honda involved the joint development of a luxury car  The two models the Rover 800 and the Honda Legend share basic design but have slightly different exteriors and interiors 
Further collaboration involved the joint development of a medium-sized car the Rover 200/Honda Concerto launched in 1989  The deals announced allowed Rover to share research and development costs with Honda 
It was also hoped that Honda 's management philosophy and production techniques would improve working practices at Rover  There was lengthy speculation that Honda might take an equity stake ie a shareholding in Rover but there appeared to be little enthusiasm for that from Honda 
It was hard to see what extra benefit would accrue to Honda from such a stake especially when in addition to the ventures already discussed an agreement had been reached to assemble Honda cars in Rover factories on spare production lines in order to provide jobs for Rover workers  In seemed that Honda was therefore able to get the benefits from the relationship between the companies without becoming involved with the responsibilities of ownership 
In the light of this the announcement in 1989 that Honda was to take a 20 per cent stake in Rover was seen as a further cementing of ties between the two companies and a long term commitment to Rover 's development by Honda  Previously the possibility that Honda viewed the links as only short-term could not be ruled out 
At the same time Honda announced a Â£300 million investment for an assembly plant at Swindon capable of producing 100,000 cars a year by 1994  This announcement meant that the three biggest Japanese car makers had all selected the UK as the site for their first European car assembly plant in preparation for the completion of the Single European Market in 1992 
However the UK willingness to accept inward investment by Japanese car firms has been criticised by other European car makers as an attempt to export unemployment to other countries  Thus these plants can be seen as creating a Trojan Horse whereby Japanese firms attempt to evade protectionist measures against imports from Japan by locating production facilities within the EC 
At the time of writing doubt still exists over two important issues relating to Japanese cars  Britain France Italy Spain and Portugal all have different VERs all negotiated bilaterally on Japanese cars 
How these restrictions are to be handled post-1992 has yet to be fixed  This is of crucial importance because restrictions on trade between EC countries will not be permitted post-1992 hence with the present system of VERs Japanese cars would be imported into one EC country without a VER and then moved to another EC country with a VER 
Furthermore it has yet to be decided whether or not Japanese cars produced in Britain should be part of an overall fixed limit  Mr Calvert President of Peugeot and highly critical of Britain 's stance on Japanese investment insisted Even if Nissan had 100 per cent local content as well as local design they would go in the overall quota 
The resolution of these issues is clearly crucial for the future of the Japanese car industry investment in Britain  Returning Rover to the private sector had been an aim of the Conservative government for several years 
However continuing financial uncertainty meant that privatisation by means of a share issue to the public was out of the question  The government therefore turned to multinational companies as potential suitors for Rover 
When details of its plan to split up and sell off parts of Rover became public in 1986 however the government faced a political storm  It followed shortly after the Westland Affair a dispute about whether Westland a manufacturer of helicopters should become involved with European or American collaboration which resulted in the resignations of two cabinet ministers Leon Brittan and Michael Heseltine 
The government proposed a that Austin Rover cars should be sold to Ford b that Leyland Vehicles including Land Rover should be sold to General Motors which manufactured Bedford trucks in the UK and c that Leyland Bus should be sold to the other major UK-based bus manufacturer the Laird Group  Each part of these proposals is now considered 
Despite substantial state investment drastic rationalisation increased productivity and the agreement with Honda Austin Rover had been unable to increase its market share or return to economic viability  In an industry dominated by much larger producers who were able to benefit from economies of scale the government therefore concluded that the sale to Ford was preferable to continued state subsidy and/or ever closer links with Honda 
Since Ford would dominate the UK car market it was hoped that the company would have a major interest in ensuring that this market was successful and that this might involve the expansion of research and development in the UK  Many objections were voiced against the proposed deal which caused such a storm that it was dropped within days of the news breaking 
It was not at all clear exactly what the proposed Austin Rover/Ford operation would entail  Critics argued that it was merely an attempt by Ford to purchase market share in the UK and that rationalisation would inevitably cause massive job losses 
There was added concern that Ford would use its position to increase its tied imports of cars cars assembled overseas but indistinguishable from those assembled in Britain  Concern was also expressed for the future of the British components industry if Ford showed less willingness to purchase British components than Austin Rover traditionally had done thus any job losses could extend beyond the two firms engaged in the merger 
There were worries that the combined Austin Rover/Ford operation would develop merely into an assembly plant for cars designed abroad  It was also feared that the British car industry would lose its research and development facilities together with its high technology capability with employees finishing up as metal bashers for overseas companies performing low value added jobs 
Such concerns have already been voiced earlier in this chapter when considering the impact of Japanese plants  These arguments led critics to claim that the position the company found itself in underlined the flaws of Thatcherism highlighted the weakness of the government 's policy towards industry and emphasised the need for a clear industrial strategy refer also to Chapter 1 pages 12â€“13 
It was argued that the government 's policy towards Austin Rover could be viewed as an attempt to slim down the company through rationalisation and privatise parts as they became profitable eg Jaguar finishing up with an unprofitable rump which had very little chance of long-term viability on its own  There was also concern that as the combined market shares of the two companies approached 50 per cent this could lead to an abuse of monopoly power 
Although there were many existing and potential foreign competitors in the car industry car prices in Britain were already significantly higher than in other EC countries and such a dominant company could have made matters worse  The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced in May 1990 that it was to investigate car pricing in Britain 
Finally there were those who argued that it was essential to keep British control over at least part of the British car industry and that after all the taxpayers money invested in Austin Rover the company should not be turned over to Ford a US multinational  The proposal to sell Leyland Vehicles including Land Rover to General Motors manufacturer of Bedford trucks caused as much disquiet as the mooted sale of Austin Rover to Ford and was eventually thwarted after much public argument when General Motors withdrew from the deal 
Faced with a much reduced market for heavy trucks in Europe including the UK in the early part of the 1980s talks were began between Leyland Vehicles and GM 's Bedford Trucks in 1984 to see if there was scope for collaboration between the two companies  Talks between GM and other European truck manufacturers had failed to produce the collaboration that GM wanted 
The benefits of a merger to GM would be to gain access to Leyland Vehicles ' recently introduced product range whereas Leyland Vehicles would have access to GM 's financial muscle and foreign dealer network  Although there would undoubtedly have been job losses after the merger the proposal can be viewed as a relatively straightforward attempt to restructure and then rationalise an industry with excess capacity with firms which were insufficiently large to exploit economies of scale and thus unable to make a profit 
If this argument is accepted some job losses in the short term would be preferable to both companies remaining in an unviable position with the possibility of complete closure for both in the long run  The merger failed because in the post-Westland environment it was seen as yet another sop to the United States and more specifically because GM insisted that Land Rover should be included in the package with Leyland Vehicles 
Critics argued that Land Rover was being offered as a sweetener to offset the lossmaking Leyland Trucks part of the business whereas GM claimed that access to its US dealership network would be beneficial to Land Rover  Despite assurances from GM that it would maintain the British content of Land Rover vehicles at existing levels considerable unease was felt by many politicians 
After the news of the secret negotiations between the government Leyland Vehicles and GM broke in February 1986 the government allowed alternative bids to be put in for the different parts of the firm  Although there were several offers made for Land Rover there were no serious contenders for Leyland Trucks 
Despite press speculation that GM might be offered a modified deal on Land Rover 49 per cent of the shares the government eventually made it clear to GM that Land Rover was not part of the Leyland Vehicles deal and as a result GM withdrew its offer  The government subsequently decided not to accept any of the bids for Land Rover during April 1986 amid considerable political embarrassment 
When in August 1986 GM announced that it was merging its North American heavy truck operations with Volvo under Volvo 's control the future of Bedford looked bleak  It was in the context of this merger and GM 's failure to find a partner for Bedford in the UK that it announced the ending of medium and heavy truck production in September 1986 
It would appear that this closure and the consequent employment effects can be attributed to the government 's failure to sanction the deal with Leyland Vehicles earlier in the year as a result of the political pressure imposed  However the position is not as simple as this because if the merger had taken place rationalisation and restructuring would have happened anyway and it is likely that certain plants in any combined GM/Leyland group would have closed 
Moreover the lack of success of many previous mergers in the UK motor industry between struggling groups does not fill one with confidence for the long-term success of that proposed venture  The government continued to explore other possibilities during 1987 engaging in talks with Paccar of the US which owns the British lorry maker Foden and DAF of the Netherlands which already had a distribution deal with Leyland 
The European solution prevailed and a joint company Leyland DAF was formed in which Rover had 40 per cent of the equity  Both Leyland Trucks and Freight Rover the profitable Sherpa Van subsidiary were included in the deal 
The restructuring involved plant closures and the loss of 2,200 jobs but it was hoped that the future of the firm would be more secure as part of a larger organisation able to secure the benefits of DAF 's distribution network in Europe  A Â£750 million grant from the British government to write-off accumulated debt was cut by Â£70 million by the European Commission 
The deal fell foul of the Commission which during the run up to the elimination of European trade barriers and the completion of the Internal Market in 1992 had begun to play an increasingly important role in competition policy  EC rules ban subsidies which are likely to distort competition 
As a consequence of the write-off of debt by the government and the upturn in the European truck industry the merger proved successful and was profitable from the start with output at Leyland increasing  After the initial failure to sell Austin Rover and Leyland Vehicles the government continued to negotiate for the sale of Leyland Bus which was to have been sold to the Laird Group the second largest UK bus manufacturer 
The demand for buses has dropped dramatically since the late 1970s and this process has been accelerated by the ending of both the bus grant and revenue support for bus services  Furthermore the deregulation of bus services has shifted demand away from traditional large buses towards smaller ones the demand for which has been met to a great extent by importers 
The proposal was however rejected in favour of a management buyout which valued the company at Â£4 million in January 1987  Thus the government rejected the argument that the best way to improve the long-run viability of the industry would be to restructure it by merging the two leading manufacturers 
Instead both firms were to compete in the market against one another and against foreign competition  Yet in 1988 the management consortium sold the company to Volvo of Sweden for Â£15 million claiming that the business had been restructured during the previous two years but that the key to success in this business is to be a world player 
Volvo promised to create extra work for the two plants and to provide substantial investment  It is possible that the increase in the value of the company was justified but it is also possible to understand accusations that this represented yet another privatised company sold at less than its real value 
Despite signs of renewed interest from both Ford and Volkswagen keen to re-establish itself as the largest car manufacturer in Europe the British government announced in March 1988 that it intended to pursue a wholly British solution for the remaining parts of Rover by selling it to British Aerospace BAe  Although Rover had reported an operating profit of Â£27 million for 1987 after years of heavy losses covered by government handouts the chances of privatising the company by an issue of shares to the public still seemed remote 
The political storm generated in 1986 by the proposals to sell various parts of Rover to foreign competition had not been forgotten and the government was keen to avoid a repetition of this particularly if unpopular rationalisation and plant closures were involved  In those circumstances the only option open to a government determined to return Rover to the private sector was to sell it to a British company which was not involved in the car industry 
When the BAe/Rover deal was first announced surprise was expressed and questions were raised about the reasons for BAe 's interest in Rover  Bryan Gould the Labour Trade and Industry spokesman questioned Is this not a further example of the sort of conglomerate merger that has served British industry so ill in the past 
The Chairman of Aerospatiale the French aerospace group commented that the proposed merger together with that between Daimler Benz and Messerschmitt under consideration at the same time risked setting a trend towards diversified national groupings which would make the task of creating a European aerospace industry capable of competing with the US more difficult  Questions were raised about the industrial logic of a merger between an aerospace company and a car company although there are several foreign combined aerospace/car groupings eg General Motors Daimler Benz Fiat and Saab 
Indeed Saab has run an advertising campaign specifically linking the two activities in the hope of raising car sales by transferring an up-market high-technology image from aeroplanes to cars  The benefits of synergy or cross-fertilisation were claimed to be one of the main reasons for the link-up 
Professor Smith Chairman of BAe claimed that synergy existed between the two companies in terms of engineering technology marketing purchasing and quality standards  Others see little sign of overlap between the two and moreover claim that any benefits will take time to accrue 
The long-term nature of the potential benefits is however supported by Graham Day Chairman of Rover This is long-term and strategic  To spot the synergy you must focus on the manufacturing process not the product 
He also claimed everyone is looking at new materials to bring down the weight of vehicles  BAe was keen to diversify in order to protect itself from the cyclical swings of both civil and military aerospace manufacturing 
In addition the Rover link would bring BAe into contact with Honda a link which was welcomed by BAe both in terms of potential collaboration in manufacturing and also as a means of facilitating sales in the Far East  As stated earlier in this chapter Rover 's links with Honda were further cemented when Honda acquired a 20 per cent stake in Rover 
The Rover link gave BAe minority stakes in several companies previously hived off from Rover in particular the 40 per cent stake in Leyland DAF  The flotation of Leyland DAF on the Stock Market in 1989 yielded BAe Â£100 million for the sale of part of its 40 per cent stake in the company this compares with Â£150 million paid by BAe to the government for the whole of the Rover Group including the Leyland DAF stake 
It is hard to put a value on a company which has large assets and turnover but which is barely profitable and it could be that BAe found the price it had to pay for Rover just too good to refuse  The terms agreed with the British government valued the company at Â£150 million but there would be an Â£800 million cash injection by the government in order to wipe out past indebtedness 
However this deal like the Leyland DAF deal fell foul of the European Commission 's rules banning subsidies which are likely to distort competition and the EC judged that Â£253 million should be reduced from the cash injection and that there should be no further government aid for Rover  The revised deal was accepted by BAe 
The EC also insisted on a biannual monitoring of Rover 's hitherto secret five-year corporate plan in order to confirm that the money allocated for restructuring was being spent on that  The plan involved proposals to reduce excess capacity and to transform Rover from being a volume car producer to a specialist producer in an up-market move with the aim of increasing profit per car sold see Figure 4.2 
The disclosure of these plans forced a premature announcement that two plants Cowley South and Llanelli Pressings were to be run down and closed in the early 1990s with the loss of about 3,400 jobs  Although BAe was blamed it was correct to point out that the corporate plan had been drawn up before the proposed merger 
Small comfort was gained from the fact that had a competitor taken over Rover instead job losses might have been considerably greater  In order to try and place the problems faced by the British car industry into an international perspective the car industries of Italy and Spain are briefly considered 
In 1985 Ford failed in its attempt to merge its European car production facilities with those of Fiat largely on the issue of which company would be dominant in the partnership  The very fact that two of the Big Six European companies were even considering merging indicates the growing emphasis on scale in the car industry and highlights the difficulties that a company such as Rover faces in the world market 
This abortive merger was followed for Ford in 1986 by the suspension of the preliminary discussions with the British government on the sale of Austin Rover  Twice thwarted Ford then turned its attention to the loss making state-owned Alfa Romeo company of Italy in what was seen as a continuation of its battle with Fiat which was also interested in acquiring Alfa Romeo 
Ford claimed that an association with another company is not essential for Ford 's continued success in Europe  However the move was seen as one which would boost Ford 's market share and which would also provide the company with a prestigious marque with a sporty image 
The Ford bid can therefore be seen as an attempt to establish Alfa in relation to Ford in the same way as the Audi cars complement the Volkswagen range  Fiat countered by proposing to merge Alfa with its own Lancia subsidiary and claimed that Our aim is to create a company specialising in high performance prestige cars with the sporty aggressive characteristics of Alfa and the luxurious comfort of Lancia a company which can put itself and Fiat at the top of the European car market 
On the face of it the motives of Ford and Fiat appeared to be similar but the key difference was that Ford 's share of the Italian car market was minimal whereas Fiat 's was in excess of 55 per cent  Thus the merger of Fiat/Lancia and Alfa would increase Fiat 's existing dominance of the Italian car market and be liable to lead to an increase in monopoly power 
Critics of Fiat therefore argued that its bid could be seen as a defensive move to improve its domestic position and perhaps more importantly to prevent a competitor from obtaining Italian production facilities which in the long run could pose a threat to Fiat  Although there was opposition to the Fiat-Alfa deal from some trade unionists who were concerned at the possible job losses caused by rationalisation after a merger the Italian government was subjected to considerable political pressure of a nationalistic nature to support the Fiat bid pressure similar to that which forced the British government to cancel the talks between Ford and Austin Rover and eventually rejected the Ford overtures in favour of an all Italian solution 
Thus the Italian government increased the dominant position of Fiat and rejected the chance of increase competition in its home market  The Spanish government too was faced with questions concerning the restructuring of the car industry during 1986 
Spain joined the European Community together with Portugal in 1986  These questions arose largely as a consequence of EC membership which necessitated a phased withdrawal of protection from the Spanish home market 
The Spanish government keen to maintain Spain 's position as a major producer of small cars made various agreements with Peugeot Citroen and Renault to guarantee continuation of existing production capacity and sold loss-making state-owned Seat the only Spanish-owned car company to Volkswagen  The Spanish car industry is dominated by five multinational companies Peugeot/Citroen Renault Ford General Motors and Volkswagen 
Spain is the fourth largest manufacturer of cars in the EC ahead of the UK  The strategy of the Spanish government ie to encourage multinational firms to establish car plants in Spain may be contrasted with the Italian government 's approach considered above 
The huge costs of model development and the increasingly competitive environment for luxury cars forced both Jaguar privatised in 1984 and Saab to seek collaboration with other companies during 1989  Jaguar initially favoured a deal with General Motors GM whereby the American company would acquire a partial stake in Jaguar in other words Jaguar 's independence would be maintained 
GM would provide funds which would have led to the joint development of a new product range  However Ford GM 's main US rival launched a bid for Jaguar which valued it at Â£1.6 billion 
Jaguar had felt itself to be protected from such a takeover by a golden share a mechanism whereby the government provides protection from takeover to recently privatised companies for a finite period of time  However the government removed the golden share protection in response to the Ford bid 14 months before it was due to expire and the Ford offer was finally recommended to shareholders by the Jaguar board 
The removal of the golden share protection followed by similar action when BP acquired Britoil in 1988 questioned the government 's whole commitment to the concept of golden shares for recently privatised companies  GM did not put in a counterbid as it considered that the company was being overvalued 
When one notes that Jaguar 's pre-tax profits for the first half of 1989 had slumped to Â£1.4 million it is easy to see that a company valuation of Â£1.6 billion might be considered rather high  However the value of a company is based on more than just short-term profitability 
There are very few independent luxury car firms with the reputation of Jaguar and volume manufacturers have found it hard to develop luxury cars of their own considered to be competitive with specialists such as Daimler Benz and BMW  In addition the move may be seen as partly defensive in order to prevent Jaguar from falling into the hands of one of Ford 's competitors 
From Figure 4.3 it can be seen that shareholders of Jaguar have done very well since privatisation especially as a result of the bid from Ford  However although the dramatic progress in terms of productivity made by Jaguar since privatisation is acknowledged critics claim that it was bound to be a takeover candidate before too long as it was a small player in a market which was becoming increasingly concentrated 
Saab faced problems similar to those confronting Jaguar  It too was involved in talks with Ford GM and in addition Fiat 
A deal was struck with GM in which GM acquired a 50 per cent stake in Saab for $600 million  This deal provided GM with the entry to the luxury car market that it had sought Saab was promised access to GM 's resources and dealership network 
The option of a Swedish solution by means of a merger with Volvo was not seriously considered in view of the restructuring and job losses considered to be inevitable from the merger of two specialist car manufacturers  Volvo itself shortly after the Saab/GM deal announced an extensive cooperation deal with Renault accompanied by an exchange of equity stakes 
The link between the two companies resulted in the creation of the world 's largest bus and truck manufacturer overtaking Daimler Benz of West Germany  It is hard to say whether any conclusions may be draw for the British car industry by considering the car industries of other countries 
It might be argued that for years Britain unsuccessfully attempted the Italian approach trying to establish an independent strong domestic producer and that now an approach in some respects similar to the Spanish approach welcoming foreign investment is being adopted  This can be seen in the attitude adopted towards Nissan Toyota and Honda although the national solution approach prevailed in the sale of Rover to British Aerospace rather than to a US multinational 
It is certainly true that the huge costs of new model development including the cost of meeting higher environmental standards have forced many European car manufacturers to collaborate or merge  This process is being accelerated by the competition provided by Japanese firms 
The trade balance of the motor industry has been in deficit since 1982 and in 1989 at Â£6.55 billion accounted for 28 per cent of the UK visible trade deficit of Â£23.1 billion  From this it may be seen that the health of the motor industry is critical to the health of the British economy 
An examination of Figure 4.4 shows that it is expected that UK car production will increase in the next ten years largely as a result of Japanese investment and that consequently the share of car imports in the British market will decline as will the motor industry trade deficit  Whilst the Conservative government was delighted to have sold back to the private sector one of its most difficult privatisation candidates the impact of recent changes in the car industry have yet to be fully assessed 
In a sense the motor industry can be seen as a test case for the Thatcherite medicine for industry  It is not surprising that as a major part of public expenditure the finances of the Welfare State should have received attention from a government which has been keen to reduce the rate of growth of public expenditure and to limit the role of the state 
However the concern with the cost and scope of the Welfare State has been ideological as well as purely economic  Although many measures have been introduced some of them extremely controversial the basic structure of the Welfare State has remained intact and the Conservative government has appeared to be more reluctant to legislate in this area than in most others content with modification rather than substantial revision 
The Welfare State was set up after the Second World War as a means of providing universal freedom from want according to Sir William Beveridge and care from cradle to grave for the whole population according to Sir Winston Churchill  The Welfare State includes the provision of health care by means of the National Health Service state education and council housing 
Furthermore an insurance against loss of income due to unemployment old age or illness is provided by means of the social security system which also provides support for those on low pay or in poverty  The Welfare State was intended to eliminate want waste ignorance disease and squalor the five giants identified by Beveridge as barriers to both prosperity and participation in society 
Consideration is given in subsequent chapters to aspects of poverty to health and to housing Chapters 6 7 and 8 respectively but this chapter deals with the social security system and attempts to reform it  The social security system was at first principally intended to support pensioners and although the numbers have increased during the last forty years the main increases in those claiming supplementary benefit now renamed income support have been the unemployed and single parents see Figure 5.1 
This point emphasises why it has been so difficult to control the overall cost of benefits which depends on both the level of benefits provided and the number of people claiming them  This will be affected not just by economic factors but by demographic and social factors as well 
Many right-wing economists have criticised the big-spending programmes of the Welfare State which were rapidly built up especially during the 1960s  They argue that the tax burden required to finance the Welfare State has reduced incentives and thereby curbed initiative and enterprise leading to an adverse effect on economic growth 
Many of the benefits of the Welfare State were provided at no direct cost to the consumer ie they were free at the point of use although of course the cost was met by the taxpayer  This concept is considered again when discussing the NHS refer to Chapter 7 pages 90â€“7 
These economists argue that by being insulated from market forces the consumer has no realistic assessment of cost and is therefore liable to overconsume  If this is true then the Welfare State may always have difficulty satisfying the expectations of the public even though the resources devoted to it since its inception have increased rapidly 
Critics point out that poverty homelessness and poor standards in both health and education still exist and that the only remedy offered by supporters of the Welfare State is to spend more money with no assurance that demand will ever be met  According to Charles Murray of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research it is essential to move away from the language of entitlement 
By providing welfare benefits recipients may become less reliant on self-help and more dependent on the state entering what has become known as a dependency culture or benefit culture  This may lead to a cycle of dependency from which it is hard to break loose 
This is likely to be particularly serious if either the poverty trap or the unemployment trap is encountered  The poverty trap exists when a low paid worker receives a pay increase but then as a result of the higher income level attained not only has to pay tax but also loses various means-tested benefits previously received 
Means-tested benefits are benefits which are not automatically given but which are dependent on the recipient 's income or wealth ie his means  As a result the individual may retain only a very small percentage of the extra income earned and in some cases may actually lose more than the extra income earned 
Hence there may be little or no incentive for a low paid worker to strive for a higher income whether by gaining promotion or by working overtime if the welfare benefits previously received disappear rapidly as income rises  Similarly the unemployment trap exists when an unemployed worker receiving benefit may be less well off or only marginally better off in low-paid employment 
In both instances a worker acting in his own self-interest may choose to retain his benefits by refusing extra pay or a job thereby perpetuating his dependency on the Welfare State  See Chapter 6 pages 86â€“7 for details of the Conservative government 's 1988 Welfare Reforms 
This highlights the twin difficulties faced when investigating welfare economics the problems of targeting and whether to apply means-testing or not  It is not just a case of directing sufficient welfare benefits towards those in need to induce a state of well-being in which needs are satisfied 
Need does not end suddenly instead there is a continuous spectrum between the two states  If benefit ceases to be paid completely when an individual reaches a certain level of income then there will be an anomaly at that point as someone earning Â£1 less will still be eligible for the benefit 
This leads to the question of targeting which has concerned the Conservative government in its social security reforms  If benefits are targeted at those most in need as assessed by a means test then the poverty and unemployment traps may be encountered 
However if the benefits are spread more widely then either the value of benefits per person will be diminished or an increase in the resources to fund the benefit will be necessary  In the UK some benefits are automatic eg child benefit which is received by all families with children and others are means-tested eg family credit which is received only by those families with low incomes 
Separate systems for income tax national insurance and welfare benefits in Britain mean that people on low incomes may be required to pay income tax and national insurance contributions whilst at the same time receiving welfare benefits  An ideal programme to help those in poverty which is probably impossible to attain in reality may be defined as one which meets the needs of the people concerned without adversely affecting their incentive to self-help by which means the individuals might reduce or eliminate reliance or dependency on the state 
The Conservative government has attempted to replace what it sees as a dependency culture by an enterprise culture  It has sought to do this by fostering popular capitalism in the hope of reintroducing the entrepreneurial streak into the British economy and revitalising British industry through the introduction of incentives to both management and workforce 
Moves to return to management the right to manage increasingly eroded by trade unions and governments during the post-war period have been encouraged  Popular capitalism necessitates a belief in the power of market forces a reduction in the role of the state an increasing reliance on self-help and moves towards extending the property-owning democracy 
The Conservative government has emphasized the notion of self-help  It has stressed the need for personal and family responsibility within a framework of the local community or neighbourhood 
The role of the state was to be changed so that it would offer help in the last rather than in the first resort  Critics of popular capitalism argue that it is a programme for increasing inequality and poverty 
To back this up they claim that a reliance on market forces has widened pay inequalities and also significantly increased unemployment  Tax cuts have been directed primarily at the better-off and welfare benefits have been restricted 
The long-term trend towards greater equality of income and wealth has been reversed under the Conservative governments of 1979 onwards and it is argued that this strategy of inequality Child Poverty Action Group which is seen as a direct consequence of the drive towards popular capitalism has led to a major increase in poverty in the UK and to the possible emergence of an underclass who lack any stake in popular capitalism and who are caught in the dependency culture  The argument about equality is of course at the heart of economic/political debate 
Socialists believe in greater equality in society A more equal society will be a more prosperous society and a more peaceful society Roy Hattersley Hansard 16 April 1987 but they are criticised for favouring policies of distribution rather than production Someone has to create wealth before the politicians fall to sharing that wealth out Kenneth Clarke Hansard 6 April 1987  Conservatives are less concerned about equality and more concerned with generating production and income believing that the benefits will trickle down through society to benefit all 
The Conservative government has been accused of presiding over an economy in which the benefits of economic growth have not been distributed fairly  Furthermore it has been argued that during the Conservative terms of office there has been an increase in the number of those living in poverty 
These points are now considered  The most serious difficulty faced when trying to assess the extent of poverty in any society is to find a clear definition which is easily understood and universally accepted 
Whereas most people find it relatively easy when faced with inflation or unemployment figures to decide whether those economic problems are improving or getting worse it is not so easy in the case of poverty in the absence of a clear widely accepted measure  Some definitions of poverty have sought to define it in terms of absolute deprivation where some measure is made of subsistence requirements based on physical needs 
This represents an attempt to assess a level of income below which it is impossible to ensure survival  In a speech shortly before leaving his position as Secretary of State for Social Security in 1989 John Moore claimed that poverty in the old absolute sense of hunger and want had been eliminated 
Certainly if one compares living standards today with those experienced in this country one hundred years ago or to make an even more stark comparison with those experienced in many Less Developed Countries LDCs today then it is true that poverty in the UK in the 1980s is relatively insignificant  However most definitions of poverty are based in terms of relative deprivation ie deprivation relative to others in the community rather than a comparison over time or between countries 
These measures present a rather different picture  Such measures take into account society 's expectations of steadily rising standards of living which also affect those living in poverty 
Thus according to the Child Poverty Action Group CPAG poverty is viewed in relation to a generally accepted standard of living in a particular society that goes beyond basic physical needs to include broader social and cultural needs as well  More starkly Fran Bennett director of CPAG says Our contention is that you have to judge poverty by referring it to culture society and the times you live in not just to what you need to avoid dying 
The EC defines people in poverty as those whose resources are so small as to exclude them from the minimum acceptable way of life of the member state in which they live  Many economists have used the supplementary benefit SB level now renamed income support to define poverty 
However a consideration of this measure reveals the problems faced when trying to assess the extent of poverty  Any increase in the SB level increases the number of those eligible to claim benefit 
Hence any increase in the provision for those in poverty is likely to result in a perceived increase in the problem  Although the SB level increased by 5 per cent in real terms between November 1978 and April 1987 this compares with an average increase of 14 per cent in real terms for personal disposable income 
As a result the SB level for a couple on the ordinary rate has fallen from 61 per cent of personal disposable income per capita in 1978 to 53 per cent in 1987  The number claiming SB has risen over the same period from three million to just under five million figures from CPAG 
The CPAG itself has chosen to define those earning less than 140 per cent of SB as living in poverty or at the margins of poverty  Evidence produced in Social Trends 1987 CSO after studying the composition of the lowest income group suggested that changes have occurred in the nature of poverty 
Significant increases in those claiming supplementary benefit were recorded from both the unemployed and from single-parent families whereas the number of pensioners claiming had decreased see Figure 5.1 page 80  The number of those affected by poverty in any society will however be influenced not only by the level of unemployment but also by what happens to the incomes of those on low pay 
In addition government policies on taxation and welfare benefits will have a significant influence  These aspects of poverty will now be considered 
During the period of the Conservative government there has been a marked growth in pay inequality  If all incomes rise by the same percentage amount then those at the lower end of the income scale will of course receive a lower extra sum of money compared to those at the higher end of the income scale 
In this case pay differentials and inequality in society would be unaltered  However the figures in Table 6.1 indicate that not only have the amounts of extra income received by those on higher incomes been greater than those on lower incomes but so too have been the percentages 
Between 1979 and 1989 those at the highest decile ie those earning more than 90 per cent and less than 10 per cent of the population increased their real income by 36.6 per cent whereas those at the lowest decile ie those earning more than 10 per cent and less than 90 per cent of the population who increased their real income by only 5.7 per cent  Based on these figures it is clear that income inequality has increased and that the benefits of economic growth have not been evenly distributed 
Critics of the government have argued that although the need for incentives throughout the economy has been stressed at the lowest end of the income scale there is greater emphasis on the need for workers to price themselves into employment by accepting less than the going rate of pay increases  The fear of unemployment the imposition of public sector cash limits and the reduction and in some cases removal of minimum wage protection provided to millions of low paid workers by Wages Councils has contributed to this 
It is correct to say that under the Conservative government pay inequalities have widened  Whether or not these can be said to have caused an increase in poverty depends of course on the definition of poverty chosen as has been described above 
However there are also other factors which determine whether the low paid have slipped into poverty  These include the government 's policy on taxation and welfare benefits and are considered below 
The Conservative party was elected in 1979 on a promise to reduce the overall level of taxation and in addition to shift the burden of tax to some extent from income direct tax to expenditure indirect tax  Both policies are in accordance with the principle of allowing the individual to have control over more of his own income 
In the 1979 Incentive Budget the basic rate of income tax was cut from 33 per cent to 30 per cent whilst the top rate was cut from 83 per cent to 60 per cent  At the same time the standard rate of VAT was raised from 8 per cent to 15 per cent 
The basic rate of income tax was then reduced from 30 per cent to 29 per cent in 1986 and thereafter to 27 per cent in 1987 and 25 per cent in 1988 thereby achieving the Chancellor 's longstanding commitment  In addition the top rate of tax was reduced from 60 per cent to 40 per cent in the 1988 Budget and all intermediate tax rates were abolished 
Cuts in the rates of taxation may be justified in terms of improved incentives and at the top rate of taxation a reduction in the brain drain' abroad  However no direct benefit accrues to individuals who do not pay taxation 
Further dispute centres on the trickle-down effect of tax cuts  Conservatives believe that tax cuts will lead to greater incentives and initiative thereby creating an enterprise culture in which the benefits of growth will ultimately spread to everyone 
However Dr Robert Runcie the then Archbishop of Canterbury claimed in the House of Lords 2 February 1987 that there is no automatic trickling down process that ensures that increased wealth will benefit the poor  Although statistics show that many benefits paid to the old poor and unemployed have maintained their real value ie kept pace with inflation under the Conservative government during the 1980s these calculations are based on the rate of inflation for the average person 
However rising prices affect different groups in different ways  The low-income groups and pensioners spend a higher proportion of their money on food and fuel whose prices have risen by more than other items and so the inflation index for these groups has risen faster than inflation for the average person 
An example of the way in which the government has pared back welfare without affecting its actual structure may be seen by considering the provision of pensions  Although the state retirement pension remains linked to prices and subject to the proviso noted above retains its real value the commitment to raise pensions in line with earnings in years when earnings rose by more than prices was abolished in 1980 
Hence the position of those relying on pensions has deteriorated relative to those in employment with rising real incomes  Although linking pensions to prices rather than incomes may not produce a great difference in one year after twenty-five years assuming incomes rise by 2 per cent per annum faster than prices the price-linked pension will be worth only approximately 60 per cent of the earnings-linked pension 
Less than a month after the 1988 budget providing tax cuts for all income earners but especially for those on high income the government 's social security reforms came into force amid great controversy with a revised scheme of welfare benefits  The aims of the reform were simplification improved targeting of benefits and a reduction in the impact of both the unemployment trap and the poverty trap 
The reforms were based on the principles discussed in Chapter 5 pages 80â€“1  The rules relating to means-tested benefits for housing benefit family credit family income supplement and income support supplementary benefit were redesigned and simplified 
However according to calculations produced by the policy Studies Institutes and noted in The Economist 12 March 1988 the overall impact of the reforms will simply be to redistribute from one group of the very poor to another  Two of the social security reforms proved to be particularly controversial 
Firstly the rules which sharply reduced those eligible for housing benefit thereby removing benefits from pensioners with limited savings were opposed by many Conservative MPs  Secondly the Social Fund was introduced 
This  was designed to replace the former system of emergency grants for special needs for such items as cookers and clothing which were dispensed under a variety of rules 
In its place the Social Fund removed the right to a grant and instituted instead a system of discretionary loans  However critics claimed that this scheme did not provide sufficient funds to those in real need 
The widespread unease with several of the measures proposed in the welfare reforms felt by many Conservative MPs demonstrates how difficult it is for any government even one with a large parliamentary majority to reform the Welfare State  Although great controversy was generated the proposed reforms were really only dealing with the margins of the Welfare State rather than with any fundamental alterations in its structure 
An examination of Figure 6.1 reveals that whilst each of the groups considered has gained over the period 1979 89 due to the tax and benefit changes discussed above the greatest gain was made by the richest tenth of the population  At the same time there were large numbers of losers within the poorest groups 
Although more recent documents have been produced a study of the main political parties ' policies on tax the social security system and poverty during the 1987 General Election campaign summarises clearly the different strands of opinion expressed during the 1980s  In their Election manifestos both the Labour and Alliance parties produced specific programmes to deal with poverty The Anti-Poverty Programme and Ending Poverty respectively 
The Conservative party did not have a programme as such but included two sections Lower Taxes and Social Security a fair deal for those in need which addressed the same problems albeit with different solutions  Lower taxation coupled with lower inflation makes everyone better off 
It promotes a climate of enterprise and initiative  Lower taxation coupled with lower inflation makes everyone better off 
It promotes a climate of enterprise and initiative  This clearly sums up the Conservative attitude to taxation and most importantly it views the alleviation of poverty as part of an overall policy to improve prosperity for everyone 
It was hoped that people would not be made worse off by taking a job the unemployment trap nor would they lose money when their gross pay rose the poverty trap due to the loss of means-tested benefits in each case  The Conservatives also promised to 
reform the tangled web of income-related benefits which had grown up piecemeal over forty years  Success in social policy depends on growth in national prosperity 
Labour 's economic failure led to damaging cuts in health care and benefits  Our increasing economic strength means that resources for care have gown and are growing

Labour 's economic failure led to damaging cuts in health care and benefits  Our increasing economic strength means that resources for care have gown and are growing 
The Labour party promised in its Manifesto  For the first two years in government we will concentrate resources on the essential tasks of combating unemployment and poverty 
The spread of poverty in the eight years has strained the whole nation and widened misery and disadvantage amongst the old and young  Much of it is the result of deliberate government policy 
For the first two years in government we will concentrate resources on the essential tasks of combating unemployment and poverty  The spread of poverty in the eight years has strained the whole nation and widened misery and disadvantage amongst the old and young 
Much of it is the result of deliberate government policy  As a first step pensions and child benefit were to be raised and long-term supplementary benefit extended to the long-term unemployed 
The recovery programme was to be paid for by reversing the tax gains made by the top 5 per cent of earners under the Conservatives although specific details were not published and by reversing the 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax proposed in the 1987 Conservative Budget  The Labour party promised to introduce a comprehensive strategy for ending low pay notably by the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage 
This of course runs counter to the Conservative view that workers should be allowed to price themselves into employment by accepting wage cuts if necessary  According to the SDP/Liberal Alliance Election Manifesto 
Poverty in Britain is getting worse  The Conservatives ' taxation and benefit policies have redistributed income from the poor to the rich 
Poverty in Britain is getting worse  The Conservatives ' taxation and benefit policies have redistributed income from the poor to the rich 
The Alliance proposals for combating poverty fell into two parts  Firstly in proposals similar to those put forward by the Labour party benefits for pensioners families with children the unemployed disabled and carers were to be raised 
Secondly in proposals which caused considerable controversy between the two parties comprising the Alliance before the election a radical restructuring of the tax and benefits systems to create one integrated system intended to be simpler and fairer was suggested  The Conservative government 's policies on taxation and welfare have brought it into increasing conflict with the Church of England 
The Church has criticised the great emphasis placed on individualism rather than collectivism and has complained about the government 's over-reliance on market forces  The Conservative emphasis on incentives initiative and the spirit of enterprise may well improve average living standards but there is a danger that not all people will participate in the general prosperity 
This gives rise to the danger of what has become known as the two-thirds one-third society in which the majority obtains secure well-paid full-time core jobs and the minority become marginalised obtaining less well-paid part-time temporary peripheral jobs and hovering on the verge of poverty  Often concentrations of such people are located either in depressed regions or in run-down inner-city areas 
The Bishop of Gloucester claimed in June 1988 that wealth gained regardless of the welfare of the rest of the community is difficult to justify  Dr Robert Runcie the then Archbishop of Canterbury claimed in October 1989 that Britain risked becoming a Pharisee society of self-interest 
As discussed earlier in this chapter the Conservatives counter with the argument that the generation of wealth is the pre-requisite for increasing social spending programmes  They also claim that poverty is not alleviated by providing ever-increasing welfare benefits but rather by providing an appropriate economic and social environment in which individuals have the incentive and the ability to raise themselves out of poverty without encountering the poverty or unemployment traps 
The National Health Service NHS was created in 1948 as a service designed to provide every citizen in post-war Britain with whatever medical treatment he requires in whatever form he requires it Sir William Beveridge  Aneurin Bevan who as Minister of Health in the Labour government pioneered the introduction of the NHS claimed Medical treatment and care should be made available to rich and poor alike in accordance with medical need and by no other criteria 
The NHS was created at a time of post-war reconstruction when large sections of British industry were being nationalised by the Labour government  This nationalisation was an attempt to achieve the socialist objective of common ownership of the means of production and also to facilitate government intervention in the running of the economy 
At the same time the Welfare State designed to provide a safety net for those incapable of fending for themselves was being rapidly expanded and the NHS can be seen as its greatest and most enduring feature  Britain was the first country to offer health care to the entire population free at the point of use 
The NHS of course did use resources and was not free to the extent that it had to be funded  However it was funded from taxes collected by central government rather than from direct payments by members of the public in exchange for the medical services received 
The pioneers of the NHS accepted that it would initially be necessary to increase the resources devoted to the service but that this would level off as medical needs were satisfied  However early budgets were rapidly broken as demand for medical services increased relentlessly and the need to make choices with scarce resources soon became apparent thereby straining the original promise of the NHS that all medical needs should be met 
Yet despite an increase of spending on health in the UK from 3Â¼ per cent of national income in 1948 to over 6 per cent of a much larger national income forty years later it is alleged that the NHS is underfunded and periodically in a state of near collapse  On the other hand despite the increase in funding during the last forty years the UK spending on health as a proportion of national income is lower than that in most West European countries and considerably lower than in the USA see Figure 7.1 
Higher spending need not of course necessarily imply an improvement in the standard of health care provided  This will be affected not just by the amount of resources devoted to health but also by the efficiency of the service 
Hence it is not possible to claim conclusively by observation of expenditure figures that standards of health care today have improved compared to forty years ago nor that the standards in the UK today are worse than those in other industrialised countries  Table 7.1 which compares five countries indicates that the US the highest spender on health as a percentage of GDP has the highest infant mortality rate and the second lowest life expectancy whereas Sweden another high-spending country has the lowest infant mortality rate and the highest life expectancy 
This demonstrates the difficulties in proving that higher expenditure leads to better health  The claim that the NHS is underfunded despite the huge increase in resources devoted to it will be examined in this chapter 
The Conservative government has been committed to increasing the role of market forces generally and reducing the role of the state in the economy  This has been shown by its programme of privatising nationalised industries and by its desire to maintain a firm control on public expenditure 
There have also been moves to reduce reliance on the Welfare State and to change the dependency culture by increasing self-reliance see Chapter 5  The Thatcher revolution has affected most areas of British life so it is perhaps surprising how little it seems to have impinged on the NHS 
Although there has been a radical management shake-up and there have been improvements in organisation and efficiency the fundamental ethos of the NHS provision of medical service free at the point of use has remained unchanged  Indeed in the Conservatives ' 1987 Election Manifesto there was ample support for the NHS and no mention of an enhanced role for the private sector 
It was claimed that money spent on the NHS between 1979 and 1987 had increased in real terms by a third that more patients were receiving treatment than ever before and that the numbers of doctors dentists and nurses had increased substantially  When faced with complaints about hospitals and especially about unacceptable waiting lists the government made an emergency payment of Â£100 million for 1987/88 and commissioned a review of the NHS 
In order to make any meaningful assessment of whether the present tax-funded NHS is preferable to schemes involving greater private sector involvement it is necessary to consider the meaning of the words underfunding demand and efficiency and to answer the following questions  1 
How is it that despite large increases of spending on the NHS in real terms there are continuing claims about underfunding  2 
As there is no direct charge for health care is demand really infinite  If this is so then however many resources are devoted to the NHS demand will never be satisfied 
What is the nature of demand for health care and does it differ from demand for other services  3 
What is the meaning of efficiency when applied to health care  Although the resources allocated to the NHS have increased in real terms there are a number of factors working against this 
For example the NHS is labour intensive and 70 per cent of its costs are accounted for by wages  Thus if wages in the NHS are linked to price increases as measured by the Retail Price Index real wages of NHS employees will be maintained but they will fall behind the increases awarded to other workers if earnings are rising faster than prices in the rest of the economy 
If as is likely NHS employees then seek and obtain wage increases in line with other increases in earnings then a greater amount of resources will be needed to fund them  However at the same time there will be no increase in the standard of services provided 
Hence it may be said that health service inflation has risen faster than inflation in the rest of the economy  The funds of the NHS have been put under further strain in addition to the pressures of rising demand by a number of other factors 
The government has not always fully funded the nationally agreed pay awards leaving health authorities to fund part of the increase from existing budgets  Furthermore during the 1980s there has also been shift of resources away from hospitals towards the family practitioner services in order to build up primary care 
Problems with the hospital sector come most readily to the general public 's attention contributing to a belief that the NHS is underfunded and this has been exacerbated in parts of the South East by moves to distribute resources away from London and the South East based on the teaching hospitals in favour of the regions  Note underfunding of course is a word that only means something when funding ie resources available is matched against demand 
The nature of demand for health care is considered below  The demand for health care has risen for many reasons 
As personal income and wealth rise consumers increase their demand for most goods  It is therefore not surprising that this should also be reflected in a rise in demand for health care 
Moreover to a great extent the health service is a victim of its own success  New technology has allowed doctors to perform previously unheard of operations such as hip replacements and open-heart surgery thereby creating a demand which had not appeared before 
In addition greater life-expectancy for which better health care is partly responsible has resulted in a greater number of old people which has created further demands on the NHS  Rising expectations about the standards of health can therefore be seen as fuelling further demand for health care 
In fact in some ways it can be seen that the more capable the NHS is of meeting demand the greater the demand is likely to be  Health care is an unusual commodity and the demand for it may not be particularly responsive to price 
The vast majority of consultations are handled by General Practitioners GPs with no need for referral for expensive hospital treatment  In those cases where the patient is referred to a hospital for further treatment it is the doctor who makes the decision as the patient will generally possess insufficient information 
Therefore it is in effect the doctor who is deciding on the level of demand  Other demand is made purely by force of circumstances eg after a car crash 
In both situations demand is determined not by price but by clinical judgement  Demand for health care is clearly not infinite but it is difficult to meet rapidly rising demand in an affluent society 
This problem is not helped by the provision of health care free at the point of use which prevents the patient from knowing the cost of the treatment  In conclusion the demand for health care differs from the demand for other services and its responsiveness to market forces is open to question 
What is the meaning of efficiency when applied to health care  When considering the number of units of output produced per worker in a factory it is relatively easy to consider efficiency over a period of time 
However in health care the concept is more difficult to explain  For example a doctor may be able to see more patients each hour and he may be being more efficient by seeing more people in a fixed period of time 
However he could achieve the same result by giving less attention to each patient  Similarly the efficiency of a hospital should not be judged just by the number of operations completed but perhaps also by the effectiveness of the operations 
Whilst the introduction of competition will undoubtedly benefit some aspects of efficiency additional costs might also be incurred  In particular the costs of administration involved in valuing various aspects of medical care essential if a free market is to be created might be considerable 
In addition in order for the price mechanism to be an effective way of allocating resources the consumer ie the patient must possess good information and it is doubtful whether this is so in most cases  Critics of the government 's drive for efficiency claim that it is motivated more by considerations of cost rather than of value for money or quality of service provided 
Those supporting the continuation of an NHS based on its initial principles funded centrally by tax finance claim that any alternative system based on private health insurance would be bureaucratic involving high administrative costs  NHS costs may be kept under control because of both the NHS 's ability to act as a bulk buyer of medicine supplies and the unlikelihood of competitive upward pressure on wage costs for health workers 
Moreover patients are more likely to receive the appropriate treatment from the NHS whereas in private schemes unnecessary treatment might be given when doctors are paid a rate for the job  Advocates of funding by tax finance therefore claim that underfunding of the NHS may be remedied by increasing government expenditure on the service 
However it would be fair to say that they do not have a long-term answer to the question What is the appropriate level of funding except that of adding on an amount based on the estimated shortfall to existing expenditure  It would also be possible although it would contravene the fundamental principles of the NHS as originally conceived to introduce charges for NHS treatment for example a small charge for every visit to a GP or a hotel charge to cover the cost of food consumed in hospital as a means of raising additional funds 
The pressures of funding have already encouraged many hospitals to generate revenue raising schemes from non-medical activities  Such commercial schemes include cafeteria services and newsagents 
However although there is clearly scope for raising revenue in this way the amounts  likely to be raised in the context of overall health spending are likely to be fairly limited 
An alternative scheme for financing the NHS involves the removing of finance from general taxation and the introduction of a health stamp or hypothecated tax  This stamp would emphasise to users the cost of the health service since it would appear as a separate tax item on the pay slip and would therefore increase in line with earnings and not prices 
There are many who believe that the NHS by providing care free at the point of use is facing an impossible task in which demand can never be satisfied  Various schemes of reform have been proposed involving the private sector in an attempt to introduce market forces to some extent into health care 
These schemes may be divided into two those advocating that the service provided by the NHS may best be improved by increasing its efficiency through the introduction of more commercial criteria and those claiming that the greatest improvements would come from changing the funding arrangements by introducing some form of health insurance  Competitive tendering see also Chapter 3 page 47 has already been introduced for many ancillary services eg cleaning catering and has reduced costs although some health authorities have found that quality of service has also suffered 
Competitive tendering could be extended to certain medical services as well  Improvements could also be made to the management structure with the introduction of more commercially-minded managers with clear financial objectives in addition to the fiercely resisted management changes already made in the NHS 
What has attracted great attention recently are moves towards an internal market in the NHS which would allow health authorities to buy and sell services to and from one another  Not only would this permit the benefits of specialisation and economies of scale ie lower average cost to be felt but would also avoid expensive duplication 
It could also be used as a means of overcoming excessively long waiting lists in some areas  The service would still be free to patients and the financial transaction would take place between the two authorities 
However most health authorities are not used to pricing their services on a commercial basis and an efficient allocation of resources would require costs to be calculated as a pre-condition  Further moves could also be made towards increasing the two-way interaction between public and private health care sectors 
Such links do exist at the present time but they are the exception rather than the norm  The NHS could purchase services from the private sector in order to clear waiting lists for particular ailments or to obtain access to specialised equipment possibly not available in NHS hospitals 
Similarly the NHS could hire out spare capacity to the private sector eg pay beds and sell support services eg X-rays  More radical moves to reform the NHS are based on a belief that individuals should take more responsibility for their health care and that this can be achieved by extending the choice of different suppliers of medical services 
There is of course already a private sector in this country incorporating companies such as BUPA and PPP and radical policies on the health service involve extending the health insurance principle in some way  A large number of schemes have emerged from various right-wing think-tanks 
Tax relief on premiums paid to private insurance schemes could be introduced  Subscribers to private schemes at present pay twice and tax relief would be a way of compensating subscribers for relieving pressure on the NHS 
However the granting of additional tax relief runs against recent trends in fiscal policy which has aimed to simplify the tax system and from an economic point of view represents a deadweight cost because those who are already members of private schemes have chosen to be so without the incentive of tax relief  The purpose of tax relief would be to encourage more people to join private schemes but this in view of the deadweight cost would be expensive 
Alternative schemes involve giving individuals vouchers to be used as payment for health care on condition that they opt out of the NHS  This requires the individual to give up his right to free use of some or all NHS services and instead to look after his own health needs either in the private sector or by paying the NHS 
There are certain problems with opting out  For example the private sector at present only provides a limited range of services and therefore no one would be able to opt out entirely from the NHS 
There would also be arguments concerning which ailments should be covered by the terms of private schemes  However the greatest problem is that those opting out would tend to be the relatively young affluent low-risk groups 
This would create a great strain on the NHS which would be dominated by the high-risk groups who would not be particularly welcomed by the private insurance companies  Such strains would be exacerbated if a trend developed in which young and middle-aged people opted out only to return to the NHS when they were unable to afford the private premiums in later life 
The NHS relies on cross-subsidisation not just between high-risk and low-risk groups but also for every individual between their low-risk years young and middle aged and high-risk years old age  The danger of allowing opting out would be that the NHS would finish up as a rump and would provide very much a second class service 
The Conservative government 's proposals to reform the health service published in the White Paper Working for Patients were designed to improve the efficiency of the NHS and at the same time increase the patient 's choice  Conservative philosophy has relied on competition to improve efficiency in other areas of the economy and the same principles were applied to the NHS 
The criteria whereby resources were to be allocated were shifted from decisions based on assessment of need by doctors and managers towards outcomes based on competition and market forces  This radical change of emphasis proved to be extremely unpopular with doctors both in primary care and the hospital service 
However the fundamental nature of the NHS was maintained in the sense that it remained a service funded from general taxation free at the point of use  In order to stimulate competition large hospitals were encouraged to become self-governing 
These hospitals would remain as part of the NHS but would be given the freedom to run themselves  Furthermore district health authorities were obliged to become traders rather than simply suppliers of hospital services 
This means that as part of an internal market hospitals would trade with one another with self-governing hospitals or with the private sector in order to provide their patients with the best treatment available  In the primary care sector of the NHS general practitioners GPs with large practices are to be offered the chance to control their own budgets and to buy hospital services on behalf of their patients 
In addition it was proposed that payment to GPs should be based far more on the size of the doctor 's patient list as this was seen as a good proxy for assessing how hard doctors work  Although alternative plans to finance the NHS were rejected ie the service continued to be funded from general taxation tax relief was offered on health insurance premiums for retired people 
The 1989 NHS Reforms were greeted with great hostility by much of the medical profession partly because they were seen as part of possible moves towards dismantling the NHS but also because of the changed emphasis brought about by the consideration of terms such as efficiency internal market and payment by results in areas where the role of the market had previously been much less prominent  Critics also considered that the emphasis on efficiency did not give sufficient importance to the quality of health care provided 
They also argued that although the whole system of competition and pricing would possibly be appropriate for specific items of surgery based on short periods of acute illness it ignored the nature of health care generally  Health care can not be conveniently packaged and priced into such things as health problems of the elderly or mentally ill 
All countries are faced with the problem of how to respond to the rapidly growing demand for health care from their populations  This is true whichever of the many varied methods of finance is used all systems experience problems with managing resources 
This is partly because it is hard to identify true costs in any health system but also because the market for health care does not operate as a normal market particularly with respect to the nature of demand  Any proposed alterations to a health care system have to weigh up the obligation of society to those who are old and sick against the preferences of those who wish to determine their own health care provision 
The main economic and social themes which have already been considered in many of the chapters of this book reappear as the dominant themes in any discussion on housing policy  On the one hand the Conservative government has sought to improve the workings of the market for housing by deregulation 
Allied to this is a belief in the primacy of the private sector and owner-occupation together with a rebuttal of public-sector municipal spending mostly associated with the 1960s which is alleged to have thrown money at problems without any consideration for the real housing needs of the people involved  On the other hand critics claim that the government has allocated too few resources to housing and has given too little emphasis to the needs of those at the bottom of the pile in the housing market the homeless and those on low incomes 
Critics also argue that this has been compounded by a policy which has unfairly favoured the private sector in preference to the public sector  According to the 1983 Conservative Election Manifesto 
A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is spread as widely as possible  Under this government the property-owning democracy is growing fast 
And the basic foundation of it is the family home  A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is spread as widely as possible 
Under this government the property-owning democracy is growing fast  And the basic foundation of it is the family home 
From these statements it is clear where the emphasis of the Conservative government lies  Families are to be encouraged to live in their own homes rather than to rely on the state in the form of local authorities for the provision of council housing 
The Right to Buy scheme introduced by the government in 1980 gave council tenants the legal right to buy their homes often at big discounts  A million homes were sold by the public sector to the private sector during the Conservative government 's first two terms 1979â€“87 see Figure 8.1 
This spread of home ownership may be seen as part of the drive towards establishing a capital-owning democracy or popular capitalism refer to Chapter 5  According to the 1987 Conservative Election Manifesto Home-ownership has been the great success story of housing policy in the last eight years 
However promises were made to shift the emphasis of policy during the Conservatives ' third term towards reforming the private rented sector of the housing market  The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has stated that 
The principle aims of national housing policy should be to ensure that as far as possible every household shall be able to occupy a dwelling of a size standard and location suitable to its needs free from nuisance harassment or arbitrary eviction and should have a free choice of tenure ie freehold leasehold or other  The principle aims of national housing policy should be to ensure that as far as possible every household shall be able to occupy a dwelling of a size standard and location suitable to its needs free from nuisance harassment or arbitrary eviction and should have a free choice of tenure ie freehold leasehold or other 
There has been much criticism of the government 's housing policy much of it from organisations outside parliament  By neglecting the public sector the government is accused of lacking an effective long-term housing policy which will meet the needs of future generations 
The criticisms made are very similar to some of those made of the government 's programme for privatising nationalised industries namely the government may have a clear policy on transferring firms from the public sector to the private sector but lacks a real industrial policy  Similarly the government may have a clear policy on transferring houses from the public sector to the private sector but it lacks a real housing policy 
In other words according to its critics the Conservative government has been too concerned with ownership and not concerned enough with the quantity and quality of the housing stock  Figure 8.2 shows that the decline of the private rented sector and the growth of owner-occupation have been long-term phenomena 
However the decline in resources directed to the public sector and the encouragement of moves towards owner-occupation under the Conservative government have prompted criticism that the three main forms of tenure owner-occupation private-rented and public-rented are not treated even handedly  These sentiments are summed up by comments from the Church report Faith in the City 
The promotion of home ownership is a deliberate policy decision encouraged directly by central government subsidy and indirectly by withdrawal of subsidy from local authority housing and the pushing up of rents  The cost of choice for the majority is the absence of choice for the minority who will never afford to buy the Right to Buy and growth of owner-occupation are effectively carried out on the backs of poor people

Such sentiments have been strongly rejected by the Conservative government which considers its drive towards popular capitalism to be open to all members of society  The report further claims that 
One of the many misconceptions about housing finance is that home-owners are self-reliant buying their houses with no resort to the state while public sector tenants are the recipients of huge hand-outs  One of the many misconceptions about housing finance is that home-owners are self-reliant buying their houses with no resort to the state while public sector tenants are the recipients of huge hand-outs 
These claims are now examined by considering the position of each sector in turn  An owner-occupier is allowed to claim tax relief on the interest paid on a loan to purchase his house up to a maximum loan of Â£30,000 
This relief cost the Exchequer Â£1.1 billion in 1978/79 but is estimated to have reached Â£7 billion in 1989/90 see Figure 8.3  The existence of such substantial relief to owner-occupiers produces a major vested interest which political parties will find hard to ignore particularly as the ranks of the owner-occupiers are swelling all the time 
Mrs Thatcher pledged that the relief would remain for as long as she was Prime Minister and the opposition parties appear unwilling to commit themselves to abolishing it  The existence of mortgage interest tax relief MITR is now examined critically in view of its rapidly escalating cost 
a  MITR is effectively an open-ended tax relief the cost of which will be determined by the number of people obtaining mortgages and the rate of interest prevailing 
This contrasts with the cash limits imposed on public sector housing subsidies and other government expenditure  b 
The system is of greater benefit to those with large mortgages than to those with small mortgages and of course is of no help at all to those without a mortgage  Moreover it is of greatest benefit to the top-rate taxpayers as the relief granted is based on the taxpayer 's marginal ie highest rate of taxation 
Income tax is levied at a basic rate of 25 per cent and a higher rate of 40 per cent correct as of 1990 budget  Thus the relief may be termed regressive 
c  Some tax reformers have argued that the abolition of MITR and other tax reliefs such as that provided for pension fund contributions would allow further cuts in income tax to take place 
The basic rate of income tax was cut from 33 per cent to 30 per cent in the 1979 Conservative Budget the Incentive Budget but further cuts were not made until 1986 when the rate was cut to 29 per cent and thereafter to 27 per cent in 1987 and 25 per cent in 1988  Others have argued that whatever resources are available to housing they could be used more effectively than is the case with the present system of MITR 
The Chancellor abolished tax relief on new Life Assurance Policies in the 1984 budget but has made no move to abolish or phase-out MITR indeed speculation in some parts of the Conservative party before the 1987 Election centred not on whether there would be a reduction but whether there would be an increase in the maximum level of relief permitted the previous increase was in 1983 also a general election year  However in the 1988 Budget the Chancellor abolished tax relief on home improvements and also limited tax relief to only one mortgage per home 
Previously two or more people purchasing a property were each able to claim tax relief up to the Â£30,000 limit  No other changes were made to the structure of the system 
d  It has been shown above that those with larger mortgages and those on higher incomes benefit most from MITR but one of the main arguments originally put forward to justify its existence was that it benefited first-time buyers enabling them to purchase a house which would otherwise have been beyond their means 
However there is no clear evidence that this is true  It may even be possible that house prices have merely adjusted upwards to meet the extra spending power of those obtaining mortgages with tax relief attached 
This is likely to be the case not just for the first-time buyer but also higher up the housing market  If this argument is correct then MITR merely boosts the capital value of all property rather than aiding first-time buyers 
e  There is no clear evidence that the MITR has helped to contribute to the nation 's stock of housing 
f  Although it is difficult to measure accurately a certain amount of money borrowed from the building society or bank based on the security of the house may be spent on general household expenditure to finance for example a new car or holiday 
If the mortgage is eligible for MITR the borrower is in fact taking advantage of subsidised credit  The Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin March 1985 has estimated that this leakage from the housing market amounted to Â£7.26 billion in 1984

In conclusion these arguments claim that the MITR is an expensive subsidy which distorts the market is regressive in its effect produces minimal help for first-time buyers and does little to enhance the housing stock  However the political problems of abolishing it outright would be huge and so some have advocated phasing it out over a period of time 
For example the ceiling for relief could be reduced from Â£30,000 to zero in ten equal steps over a ten-year period of time  If even this measure were deemed politically unacceptable then by maintaining the Â£30,000 limit over time the real value of the relief would of course decline 
Assuming a constant rate of inflation of 5 per cent per annum the real value of the relief would decline by a compounded figure of 39 per cent over 10 years and if inflation were at a constant 10 per cent per annum the corresponding decline would be 61 per cent  In addition to the tax advantages gained from MITR the owner-occupier gains from the tax system in two additional ways 
Firstly no tax is levied on the capital gains realised on the sale of an owner-occupier 's house  This applies to one house only 
Thus the capital invested in house purchase is treated differently to other forms of investment  It is true that since 1982 allowance has been made for inflation indexation when calculating capital gains generally and gains made before 1982 are no longer eligible for any tax 
However even if the price of the house rises by more than the rate of inflation ie a real capital gain has been made capital gains tax CGT is not levied  Secondly there is no tax levied on imputed income 
This represents a notional calculation of the benefit gained by living in one 's own house or in other words the rent which one would consider paying for the use of the house  This benefit is taxed in several other European countries but was abolished in this country in 1963 
Figure 8.4 indicates that although private sector construction increased steadily from the depths of the recession in 1981 the number of dwellings completed in 1988 was still below completions achieved during the 1960s  This was the case despite the great shift towards preference for owner-occupation that had occurred subsequently and as described above a favourable tax regime towards such housing 
Although there has been some fluctuation in private sector figures this is nothing compared with the dramatic decline shown in the public sector figures  Local authorities constructed only 21,000 dwellings in 1988 compared with an average of 152,000 per annum during the 1960s 
It should be pointed out that the decline has not just been in evidence under the Conservative government but was also apparent before 1979 although it has accelerated subsequently  The main reason for the decline in housebuilding in the public sector is the strict control of local authorities ' capital spending by the central government as part of the government 's attempt to control overall public expenditure 
Furthermore local authorities are also allowed to spend only 20 per cent of the money raised from the sale of council houses to tenants  This limitation of course does not allow for full replacement of the council housing stock 
The decline in public sector housebuilding and the rise in council house rents together with the transfer of many council houses to the private sector has resulted in an increase in the number of homeless people most of whom come from groups who are unable to afford to become owner-occupiers  Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide accommodation for homeless households in priority need eg households with dependent children or where a member of the household is vulnerable due to mental illness or old age 
In addition however they secure accommodation for some homeless households who do not fall within this category  Numbers overall for those homeless have increased from 97,000 in 1984 to 135,000 in 1988 
LONDON 'S HOMELESS  The rise in homelessness has given rise to a vast increase in the amount of bed and breakfast accommodation used particularly in the London area 
The expenditure required is borne by the local authorities and occurs because they do not have sufficient suitable housing in a state of good repair  Local authorities claim that investment is needed not only to build new homes and replace dilapidated housing but also to renovate deteriorating buildings and thus improve the existing housing stock 
Investment is also needed to reduce the backlog of repairs  The calculation of this amount is again extremely difficult but estimates have ranged up to Â£35 billion National Economic Development Council 
Based on the forecasts of the Labour government 's Green Paper of 1977 550,000 fewer houses were built during the period 1976â€“86 than were envisaged as being necessary in order to satisfy the anticipated need  The private sector of rented accommodation has become a relatively minor part of the housing market and its long-term decline certainly stretches back to the First World War 
At that time about 90 per cent of households lived in privately-rented accommodation the figure has since dropped to 8 per cent  Thus individuals are only presented with a limited choice of tenure and according to the Nationwide Building Society 
the prime weakness of the UK housing market is the near absence of provision of private-renting which would meet the demands of lower income households a very different situation to that which prevails in many European countries  the prime weakness of the UK housing market is the near absence of provision of private-renting which would meet the demands of lower income households a very different situation to that which prevails in many European countries 
The reasons for the decline in this sector of the housing market may be seen in terms of simple demand and supply analysis the letting of accommodation has become less desirable for landlords and other forms of tenure have become more attractive for potential tenants  Rent control and security of tenure were first introduced in 1915 as a wartime measure to control rents and have remained ever since albeit in amended forms 
It was intended that these measures should provide the tenant with a defence against the unscrupulous landlord both in terms of protection against unfair eviction and also as a guarantee of fair rents especially for those on low incomes  However the attempts to improve the position of the tenant have interfered with the market mechanism which has led to a decline in the supply of accommodation on offer 
Rent control leads to a decline in the rate of return on the rented accommodation when compared to what could be earned if the capital value of the house were invested elsewhere  Security of tenure also means that a landlord may be unable to regain his house if he wishes to 
A residence with sitting tenants will sell at a discount to its open market value so there is a strong disincentive for landlords to relet any accommodation which becomes vacant  Whilst some of this housing stock may be left empty other landlords may sell to the private sector ie to individuals who wish to use the building as owner-occupiers 
At the same time there is no incentive to construct new dwellings for the sector owing to the existence of controlled rents below the market rate  Furthermore a drop in maintenance spending is also likely as both the landlord 's means and incentive to spend money on the property are reduced 
There have also been cases of deliberate neglect of property in order to force tenants out of the building  This has become known as Rachmanism after the exploits of an infamous landlord in the 1950s following the 1957 Rent Act which attempted to de-control private rented accommodation 
Thus there will be a decline in the quality of the housing stock available to this sector and a corresponding increase in both empty houses and the number of those who are homeless  For these reasons critics of rent control and security of tenure argue that if the market mechanism were allowed to operate the supply of rented accommodation would increase and its quality improve 
If this analysis is accepted then it is clear that the attempt over a long period of time to protect the position of those living in privately rented accommodation has failed and has in fact made the position worse  The Inquiry into British Housing 1985 chaired by the Duke of Edinburgh under the auspices of the National Federation of Housing Associations was a report produced one hundred years after the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes which inquired into housing provision in urban areas during the Industrial Revolution 
The report made a number of recommendations which add up to proposals for restructuring the way we organise housing provision in this country  The report called for 
radical changes in the current fiscal arrangement both between tenures and within tenures and a sorting out of local government finance and housing subsidy assistance  We are anxious to see the urgent problem tackled at once 
radical changes in the current fiscal arrangement both between tenures and within tenures and a sorting out of local government finance and housing subsidy assistance  We are anxious to see the urgent problem tackled at once 
The report also recommended the introduction of a needs-related housing allowance which would be available to people based on their means and their housing requirements  It would replace all 
existing forms of personal support that is housing benefit for tenants mortgage interest tax relief for owner-occupiers and the housing ingredient in supplementary benefit  existing forms of personal support that is housing benefit for tenants mortgage interest tax relief for owner-occupiers and the housing ingredient in supplementary benefit 
This would create a fairer system in which those in need of help would gain the most and in which a fairer balance would be struck between different forms of tenure  Secondly the establishment of a new basis for rents was recommended 
Rents should be related to the capital value of the property thereby reflecting its popularity in market terms  This is in effect recommending that most rents should rise in order to provide an inducement for landlords to relet empty property 
Also it was hoped that investors eg pension funds would put their money into property for letting assured of a reasonable return  The report points out that in order for those on low incomes to be able to afford a rent based on the capital value of the property the proposal for the creation of a housing allowance would be a pre-requisite 
Similar conclusions were reached in Faith in the City  The charity Shelter has produced various reports proposing that greater resources should be directed towards a public sector new housing programme of 100,000 units a year 
They have also highlighted the need for increased spending on repair for improvement of existing public sector housing and also for greater public sector support for private sector improvements  The Conservative government 's 1988 housing reforms contained several proposals aimed at rejuvenating the private rented sector after the years in which the promotion of home-ownership was at the forefront of housing policy 
Rent controls on all new lettings were to be lifted in an attempt to allow landlords to charge a market rent in the hope that this would increase the supply of rented accommodation  In a further attempt to restrict the role of local authorities in housing council house tenants were given the right to switch to an alternative landlord either in the form of a housing association or an approved private sector landlord in other words they were allowed to opt out of local authority control 
In addition Housing Action Trusts were proposed in order to take over the operation of specific run-down council estates with the intention of changing their tenure to the private sector or housing associations  Critics argue that the proposals to raise rents will have relatively little effect on the supply of rented accommodation as the balance of advantage is still tilted far too much in favour of owner-occupation 
However the increase in rents will cause hardship to many on low incomes all the more so after the Â£600 million cuts in housing benefit which formed part of the 1988 social security reforms refer to Chapter 6 pages 86â€“7  The wide disparity that has emerged between house prices in different regions provides a major obstacle to geographical mobility of labour 
People in regions with low house prices are usually unable to afford to purchase a house in a higher priced area whereas those in the higher priced areas are unwilling to move out in view of the lower capital gains to be made  The waiting list system for council housing also inhibits council tenants ' mobility 
The provision made for those moving from region to region is limited and most have to rejoin the waiting list  As discussed in Chapter 9 this is a feature of the North-South divide where the problem of high house prices is particularly associated with the South East 
Data for house prices is provided in that chapter  The shortage of land for development has caused the price of land to rise 
In order to increase the supply of land and thereby moderate further upward moves in house prices the government could allow controversial development in the green belt or could release public sector land not at present being used  The housing market is characterised by an irregular cyclical pattern of house price movements 
To some extent this is due to the relative inelasticity of supply for housing  New houses take time to complete and hence increases in demand for houses are reflected in an increase in the price of both existing and new houses 
A limited supply of land for building in certain areas will contribute further to price rises  However the house price cycle may also be explained by the changing nature of the demand for housing which is no longer just for consumption purposes ie to provide a roof over one 's head but is also for investment reasons 
The tax free capital gains made by owner-occupiers generally far exceed any possible savings that they might make from their income  The rising trend of house prices albeit with a cyclical pattern has on occasions given rise to an upward sloping demand curve 
This indicates an increase in demand for housing based on the expectation of future price rises  During times when house prices are rising house purchasers often feel that the upward trend will continue for ever 
This encourages first-time buyers into the market believing that it is now or never and also encourages existing home owners to trade up to larger accommodation  As long as property prices continue to increase both will feel vindicated and will be able to point to capital gains albeit paper gains made 
The capital gains to be made exaggerate house price movements  This is because capital gain on the whole value of the house accrues to the owner whereas he only has to repay a relatively small proportion of the mortgage each year 
Thus the percentage gain on the investment made is likely to be large during periods of rapid house price increases  Owner-occupation or home-ownership accounts for a greater proportion of the housing stock in the UK than in any other EC country 
The desire to own property has been advanced by the Conservative government 's Right to Buy scheme but the moves towards home ownership have been accelerated by the benefits of mortgage interest tax relief and the absence of capital gains tax as discussed earlier in the chapter which mean that house purchase is perceived as being an attractive subsidised investment  We now need to consider the effect of rapidly rising property prices on individual behaviour 
The effect is similar to a situation in which share prices rapidly increase a bull market  Rising property prices or share prices cause homeowners and shareholders to feel more wealthy this is known as the wealth effect 
Individuals feel that they need to save less than before as they have property or shares to fall back on and as a consequence they raise consumption  A falling savings ratio and rapidly rising consumer expenditure were certainly significant features of the second half of the 1980s 
For this reason fears have been expressed that rising house prices pose a major threat to price stability generally  The consumer boom was fuelled not just by the falling savings ratio at a time when economic growth allowed incomes to rise strongly but also by a tax cuts especially in the budgets of 1987 and 1988 and b readily available credit particularly in the aftermath of the deregulation of the City in 1986 known as Big Bang 
When the Stock Market crashed in October 1987 many economists thought that it would be followed by an end to the property boom and a downturn in the real economy  Monetary policy was eased in order to avoid a downturn or recession 
This helped to avoid a recession and the real economy continued to grow strongly  In addition property prices continued to boom rising at a rate in excess of 20 per cent during 1988 in some areas the increase was even more rapid the rise in East Anglia was approximately 40 per cent 
However the consumer boom caused a rapid deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments and an upturn in the rate of inflation  Both exerted downward pressure on the sterling exchange rate 
Interest rates were raised in response to these problems refer to Chapter 12 bank base rates were raised in steps from 7Â½ per cent in May 1988 to 15 per cent in October 1989 and mortgage rates followed the interest rate trend  This put an end to the national house price explosion although the effect varied significantly between regions 
Average prices decreased by 13.3 per cent in the South East during the twelve months prior to March 1990 whereas the corresponding figure for the North of England was an increase of 25.2 per cent  Those areas which had shown the greatest price increasing during the boom tended to suffer most when the boom ended 
Although for long established homeowners falling property prices represent merely a paper loss likely to be relatively small compared to paper gains made in preceding years those who bought at or close to the peak of the boom will suffer an absolute drop in the price of their homes  In particular those who borrowed more than was perhaps prudent based on the expectation of a continuing rise in the price of property may find themselves facing the twin problems of a capital loss and higher mortgage repayments 
The attractions of home-ownership in times when property prices are falling and also when interest rates are high are that much less and the Conservative government which had strongly promoted home-ownership was faced with considerable public disquiet  The increase in the cost of repaying mortgages the greatest component of the average family 's budget caused a reduction in the amount of money available for general consumption and hence a reduction in living standards 
At the very time when householders were facing high mortgage repayments and declining house prices the government introduced reforms to the local taxation system which imposed additional financial burdens on many people  The changes made discussed below furthermore removed the only remaining form of property tax in the UK 
The system of raising local authorities ' revenue by means of the rating system where the rateable value of property served as the basis for payment had been unpopular for many years  However as there was no agreement on an alternative the system survived 
During the 1980s the Conservative government was able to make a great deal of political capital from the activities of high spending Labour councils many of which were branded Loony Left councils  However despite attempts to curb the spending power of various councils by rate-capping local authority finances remained a thorn in the flesh of the government 
The rating system was criticised for being unaccountable only householders paid rates and moreover local authorities relied on grants from central government for the majority of their funds  This was very complicated and in the view of the Conservatives allowed excessive local authority expenditure without subjecting councils to local accountability 
The community charge referred to by many people as the poll tax was introduced when rates were abolished in April 1989 Scotland and in April 1990 England and Wales  The community charge was intended to be a simple and visible system of raising revenue in which the behaviour of profligate assumed to be Labour councils would be evident to the electorate 
Each adult would be liable to pay a flat-rate personal community charge  This covered all adults over the age of eighteen with certain limited exceptions and was therefore more broadly based than rates in an attempt to improve democratic accountability 
The flat-rate system of payment was by definition independent of the ability to pay and this caused great controversy  The previous attempt to introduce a poll tax in England provoked the Peasants ' Revolt in the fourteenth century 
As stated above exceptions were introduced for those with very limited means but these did not prevent a huge storm of protest at the time of the introduction of the new system  At the same time the government reformed the rating system as it applied to companies by introducing a uniform business rate set at the same rate throughout the country 
It should however be pointed out that even after the introduction of the community charge local authorities would still be raising only about one-quarter of their own revenue the remainder coming from central government grant and the uniform business rate  Although there were wide variations between local authorities the government predicted that the average community charge for England and Wales for 1990/91 would be Â£278 
The outcome of Â£365 was significantly higher than predicted for two reasons  Firstly in the government 's calculations it had allowed only an increase of 4 per cent in the spending of local authorities over the expenditure under the last year of the rating system whereas inflation turned out to be in excess of 7 per cent 
Hence an increase of 7 per cent would have been required to maintain the real level of spending  Secondly many local authorities took the opportunity to raise expenditure relying on the complexities of the system to confuse the electorate by blaming high poll tax bills on the new system itself and hence on the government rather than on their own spending plans 
Faced with a public outcry at the levels of poll tax the government announced plans in April 1990 to charge cap twenty-one mainly Labour authorities  However this not only removed local accountability the original motive for introducing the new system but it also did not affect many areas of the country which were faced with high community charges 
In the short term there are various measures that would be open to the government if it wished to reduce the impact of the community charge  Widespread charge capping would be possible but would reduce accountability 
So too would proposals to transfer certain local authority services eg education fire police from local to central government responsibility  Such a scheme would add to the central government 's tax burden and also increase centralisation of power still further 
Increased grants from central to local government would allow councils to reduce poll tax demands  However there would be no guarantee that they would do so they might use the money for additional spending on services 
Moreover such a trend would be counter to government action during the 1980s when central government grants to local government were progressively reduced  Another possibility open to the government would be to increase exemptions from the charge for those on low pay but this would only really operate at the margin' 
Various alternative schemes for raising local authority revenue have been proposed and are in operation in other countries  Local authority revenue could be obtained through either a local income tax and/or a local sales tax in other words through methods similar to those used in raising central government revenues 
The old rating system was of course one form of property tax and various proposals based on the taxation of property often referred to as a roof tax have been put forward  Taxation of property could be based on the capital value of the house or its land or rateable value 
A great advantage is that taxation of property which is geographically immobile is easier to collect than a taxation on individuals who may be mobile  In addition those who favour the return of a property tax point out as described earlier in this chapter that there are many financial advantages involved in purchasing a house and that a property tax might serve to dampen down the overheating of the housing market evident during much of the 1980s 
It should however be pointed out that there is a major difference between theoretical ideas and specific proposals  The major opposition to the poll tax came to the fore only when people realised how much they would have to pay 
The theoretical proposal had been public for several years  The Conservative government has encouraged moves towards owneroccupation or home-ownership in Britain 
It has obliged local authorities to sell off council houses and has reduced the importance given to municipal housing  Critics claim this has contributed to a significant rise in homelessness and that the government 's policy on tenure has not contributed much to housebuilding 
Some moves have been made to deregulate the private rented sector but this still accounts for a relatively insignificant part of the housing stock  Whilst cutting subsidies to the public sector tax relief to the private sector has grown enormously 
This together with easy access to credit after deregulation and the political drive towards owner-occupation under the Conservative government has contributed to a house price boom  This has given large capital gains to many people but also a misleading picture about the ease of making money 
Often capital gains from unproductive assets have been easier to come by than profit from investment or from working  In addition individuals ' savings have been directed into house purchase rather than into productive investment opportunities 
The political spin offs of a stagnant property market for the party of home ownership have yet to be assessed  The Conservative government under Mrs Thatcher has been accused of abandoning the One Nation style of Toryism and of widening the North-South divide 
During the 1980s the discussion about disparities of prosperity between different regions in the UK has focused increasingly on the issue of the North-South divide  The popular conception of this phenomenon is that if one divides the country into two there are different characteristics appertaining to the two areas 
Prosperity is concentrated in the South which is expanding fast thereby creating rising real incomes and new employment particularly in high-technology industries and the service sector  On the other hand the North remains depressed containing stagnant industries and high unemployment with many areas in decline particularly in the inner cities and the longstanding assisted areas 
However before even considering the data and evidence required in a discussion of the North-South divide there are two points which need to be made  Firstly it must be realised that whatever data are used to measure the prosperity of a region these will not represent the whole picture 
Decaying inner cities are to be found in the South as well as the North and there are areas within the South in which high unemployment deprivation and poverty exist  Similarly in the North there are prosperous areas within otherwise depressed regions 
Hence if evidence is found to support the existence of a North-South divide this must be seen in terms of measures of averages for particular regions  This leads to the second problem which is concerned with the exact demarcation of the North-South boundary 
The South is generally understood to include the South East and East Anglia  Many studies also classify the South West the East Midlands and the West Midlands as parts of the South 
The North on this basis comprises Scotland Wales Northern Ireland and the remaining areas of England North England Yorkshire and Humberside and the North West see Figure 9.1  When considering the issue of the North-South divide two questions need to be asked 
a  Does the divide exist 
b  Is the divide widening 
This chapter studies only the phenomenon of the North-South divide and does not consider its causes  Some of the possible explanations are given in Chapter 10 when regional disparities are studied 
Most economies contain regional disparities claims about a North-South divide in Britain are contrasted with a South-North divide in Italy where the South is relatively less prosperous than the North  Whether or not the government could have intervened in the economy by adopting a more active regional policy in order to reduce regional disparities and hence the North-South divide is considered in Chapter 10 
So too is the argument that governments should do the reverse and intervene less in the running of the economy relying instead on market forces  There are several ways of considering the relative levels of prosperity in different regions 
These are considered below  In column 2 of Table 9.1 the share of UK GDP accounted for by each region is recorded for 1988 
Column 1 in the same table considers the share of UK population accounted for by each region for the same year  If the share of UK GDP accounted for by a particular region is equal to its share of UK population and if this is true for all regions then GDP is spread proportional to population throughout the country 
However if the share of UK GDP accounted for by a particular region is higher than its share of UK population then that region is relatively more prosperous than the average conversely for a lower figure  Table 9.1 indicates that the South East was the only region that had a higher share of GDP than would be expected from its population size 
The economy in the South East representing 36.3 per cent of UK GDP dominates the whole economy and its size is more than three times that of any other region refer also to Figure 9.2  GDP per head is then compared between regions 
A figure of more than 100 indicates that GDP per head in that region is higher than the UK average and conversely a figure lower than 100 indicates that the region 's GDP per head is lower than the national average  It should be pointed out that whereas the figures in columns 1 and 2 are percentages of the whole so that the sum of the figures in each column is 100 the figures in column 3 are index numbers comparing GDP per head in a region with UK GDP per head 
A figure of 119.4 indicates that GDP per head in the South East was 19.4 per cent above the average in 1988  Furthermore the South East can be seen to have been the only region with a figure above the national average all other regions were below the average see also Figure 9.3 
Column 4 considers regional unemployment rates as a proportion of the working population  The rate recorded for the South East was under half that recorded for the North of England 
Only four regions the South East the South West East Anglia and the East Midlands produced figures below the national average  Long-term regional unemployment measured here by those unemployed for more than three years is often taken as a good indicator of how deep a region 's problems may be 
When considering the long-term unemployed as a percentage of those unemployed the same four regions together with Wales and Scotland produce figures below the national average  However it should be pointed out that the Welsh and Scottish figures are percentages of much higher unemployment rates and are therefore not as favourable as might at first seem 
An overall consideration of the data in Table 9.1 appears to indicate the existence in the South of an inner core of prosperity the South East and an outer periphery East Anglia South West and East Midlands compared with the relatively less prosperous regions of the North  Figure 9.4 considers male average gross weekly earnings 
On this map the data is recorded by county and not by region  However a similar pattern to that described above appears 
The high figure recorded for the Grampian area of Scotland is principally attributed to North Sea oil  The most publicised aspect of the North-South divide has been the wide disparity between house prices in different regions of the country 
Figures for the average price of a detached house in each region for 1988 are provided in Table 9.1 column 6 and indicate that houses in the South East are much more expensive than elsewhere in the country  The difference in regional house prices acts as a major obstacle to mobility of labour 
Those wishing to move into the South may be unable to afford to buy a house or may be able to buy only a much smaller house with the money raised from their existing dwelling  There may also be a reluctance to move out of the South in the fear that if house prices in the North increase at a slower rate it may be difficult to return to the South at a later date refer also to Chapter 8 page 107 
Answering the question Has the North-South divide widened during the 1980s is fraught with difficulties and to some extent the answer depends on which economic indicators are viewed and the way in which the calculations are interpreted  In particular conclusions are often drawn with reference to the word percentage but often the question percentage of what is conveniently ignored 
The way in which different conclusions may be drawn from one hypothetical set of data is now shown below  In absolute terms region A suffers more from the rise in unemployment 5,000 than does region B 2,000 
However this does not take into account the different sizes of the populations of working age between the regions  When unemployment as a percentage of the population of working age is taken into account region A shows an increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent a rise of 2.5 percentage points and region B shows an increase from 20 per cent to 24 per cent a rise of 4 percentage points 
On this basis the position of region B has deteriorated with respect to region A. On the other hand one may say that for Region A between year 1 and year 2 unemployment increased by 25 per cent expressed as a percentage of unemployment in year 1 and for region B unemployment increased by 20 per cent expressed as a percentage of unemployment in year 1  This hypothetical situation illustrates some of the difficulties likely to be experienced when considering the North-South divide and shows why so many conflicting claims have been made about this question 
There are many different measures which could be chosen when trying to assess whether the North-South divide has widened  We shall consider three 
a  The share of UK GDP accounted for by each region 
b  GDP per head in each region 
c  Regional unemployment 
The period of time studied is the ten year interval from 1978 until 1988. 1978 was the last full year before the Conservative General Election victory in 1979  Table 9.2 columns 1 and 2 indicates that the share of UK GDP accounted for by the South East the South West East Anglia the East Midlands and Northern Ireland increased between 1978 and 1988 
Again care with the figures is necessary subtraction of column 1 from column 2 would be meaningless as the figures are percentages of different amounts  Hence column 3 merely registers whether an increase or decrease was observed between 1978 and 1988 
Columns 4 and 5 show that GDP per head compared with UK GDP per head rose between 1978 and 1988 in all of the five regions listed above except the East Midlands  It should be pointed out that if a region 's GDP per head declines as a proportion of UK GDP it does not necessarily imply that the region 's GDP per head has declined in absolute terms but only in comparison with that of the UK 
Thirdly changes in unemployment are now considered  The rate of unemployment as a percentage of the working population is recorded for both 1980 and 1988 columns 1 and 2 for each region refer also to note section on Table 9.3 
The difference between the two figures is calculated for each region  It can be seen that whilst all regions reflected the higher national unemployment rate some regions fared better than others 
The South East the South West East Anglia and the East Midlands were again the regions showing increases less than the national average for unemployment as a percentage of the working population  However when considering the increase in unemployment in each region as a percentage of the rate of unemployment in that region in 1980 different results are produced 
Lower than average increases are recorded in the South West East Anglia the West Midlands and the North  The South East produces an above-average figure because the 1980 unemployment rate was low even a small increase will therefore appear large proportionately 
It is clear therefore that a conclusion about whether the North-South divide has widened is more difficult to draw from a consideration of unemployment figures than from GDP figures  Any firm conclusions would require much more lengthy analysis than is possible in this book 
The regional differences in house prices have been considered earlier in this chapter and in Table 9.1 column 6  However it is clear that the divergence between the North and the South has widened during the period 1981 7 see Figure 9.5 
Nevertheless it is only fair to say that this marks a period of boom in house prices  Following the end of the boom in 1988 prices fell fastest in regions which had shown the highest increases previously 
One might expect that differences in the level of regional income and employment would be accompanied by a migration of labour into the more prosperous regions  However the evidence shows that although there is a drift to the South see Figure 9.6 there is relatively little migration between regions when compared with movement within the regions themselves 
There are many factors which might explain this immobility of which one certainly is the regional variation of house prices considered above  The North-South divide may also be observed when considering the political map of Britain after the 1987 General Election see Figure 9.7 when previous regional electoral trends were reinforced 
Even when compared with the 1983 landslide victory the Conservative share of the vote increased in the South East including Greater London East Anglia West Midlands and East Midlands and registered only a marginal decline in the South West albeit with a share of the vote still in excess of 50 per cent  The Conservatives made particularly large losses in Scotland 
The effect of the first past the post electoral system exaggerated trends in regional voting patterns leaving Labour with one seat only in each of the South East excluding Greater London South West and East Anglia out of 108 45 and 20 respectively  Conversely the Conservatives gained only ten seats in Scotland and eight seats in the North of England out of 72 and 36 respectively 
The political fortunes of the Conservative party based on the evidence of the 1987 General Election are increasingly regionally-based and reflect to some extent the economic fortunes of the different regions  This chapter has studied the phenomenon known as the North-South divide 
For reasons given in the text all figures should be treated carefully  There are certainly divergences in prosperity apparent between the different regions of the country with the South East clearly the dominant region both in terms of its size and economic performance 
However the question Has the North-South divide widened under the Conservative government is a difficult one to answer a limited amount of data has been presented but the evidence over the ten-year period studied is not conclusive  The following chapter considers the various policies which have been proposed to deal with regional imbalances and is then followed by a study of inner cities 
PROLOGUE  APPROACHES 
From a Peak in DariÃ©n  The Strait That Shall Forever Bear His Name 
The first dawn on the Pacific Ocean is the first dawn on the world  This happy coincidence happy that is for all those visionaries and seers who speak in sonorous phrases about the New Pacific Century and the Grand Pacific Age and find such a discovery a perfect symbol of what they 're talking about has been the case ever since 22 October 1884 when a group of scientists and politicians met in a hotel in Washington DC and set down the rules by which the planet was henceforth to organize the keeping of its time 
They adopted the invention of a man named Charles Dowd who was then employed as principal of the Temple Grove Ladies ' Seminary in Saratoga Springs New York  Professor Dowd as he liked to be called and who cut his hair and trimmed his beard to look just like President Lincoln probably never travelled to the Pacific nor to very many other places outside America but he had an abiding interest in his country 's enormous and burgeoning railway system and from that fascination grew a scheme which changed the world and particularly the Pacific for ever 
Professor Dowd found it particularly irritating and inconvenient as did the railway companies and their customers that in the mid-1860s the continental United States had no fewer than eighty different standards of time  In the state of Pennsylvania for instance the Penn Central line ran on Altoona time which was ten minutes fast on Pittsburgh while the Pittsburgh Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad ran on Columbus time which was thirteen minutes slow 
What happened when trains from the two lines converged on Pittsburgh which of course they did utterly confused and bewildered the poor steel-workers and their families and all the other benighted souls whose destination this was  It was left to Professor Dowd to come to their aid in 1870 by publishing a 107-page monograph entitled A System of National Time for Railroads 
This paper regarded by students of horology as a classic of its kind suggested that the United States be divided along longitude lines into a number of time zones each one precisely one hour behind its eastern neighbour  Crucially he arranged these zones every 15Â° longitude apart with 360Â° around the globe and 24 hours to deal with simple arithmetic indicated that each zone should be roughly 15Â° wide 
So America was pared into four the Eastern time zone the Central Mountain and Pacific  When it was noon in New York Miami and Pittsburgh so it was 11 in the morning one hour back in Chicago Dallas and New Orleans at the same moment the clocks in Denver Butte and Albuquerque would read 10 am while it would be 9 in Seattle San Francisco and San Diego 
Within ten years his plan simple and eminently sensible was agreed by all the railway companies and shortly afterwards and to all intents and purposes by all the states  At noon on Sunday 18 November 1883 all the public clocks in North America were changed to what the New York Herald called the new standard of time agreed upon as an obvious convenience in all social and business matters 
And Professor Dowd 's reach swiftly became global fourteen years after the publication of his monograph and a year after America adopted his system so the International Meridian Conference in Washington agreed as well the entire world not just the American portion of it should be divided into time zones with Greenwich as the prime meridian  Moreover it should be divided along the very lines suggested by the modest principal from a small spa town otherwise hitherto and subsequently better known as the site where Ulysses S. Grant died and where America keeps its Horse-racing Hall of Fame 
There may well be a modest marble tombstone for Mr Dowd somewhere in Saratoga Springs but each time the television continuity announcer advertises a forthcoming programme as showing at 9 pm Eastern 8 Central and Mountain then one might say of the late Professor si monumentum requiris circumspice  There might well also be a memorial to Dowd on the tiny island of Tafahi in the northern part of the Pacific Ocean 's only remaining monarchy the kingdom of Tonga 
For Tafahi is the closest populated island in the world to the western side of the International Date Line which is the obvious corollary to or the logical antithesis of the Greenwich prime meridian  Since it is to the west and the world turns to the east Tafahi is thus the place which greets the world 's new day first it is the island where the day begins 
And where the week the month the year the decade the century the next millennium begins  Tafahi is indeed The Island Where Time Starts 
In plain symbolic terms I thought no place on earth could be more suitable for opening an account of the newness of the new Pacific Ocean  I had read all manner of learned papers and cover stories in American news magazines talking of the Dawn of the Pacific Age and suchlike so why not go where that dawn actually happens 
Perhaps I might see in the rising of that sun some icon quintessentially Pacific or think some thought which in a flash would sum up the essential message of the great Ocean  It was a costly venture of course since Tonga is a very great distance from almost everywhere but a glossy journal owned by an extremely wealthy New Yorker thought that a visit to The Island Where Time Starts could make an agreeable tale therefore handed me a sheaf of air tickets and a small sum in hard currency and told me to be on my way 
And so on a blustery February evening in the very middle of the South Pacific summer and I was warned of the hurricane season I flew to within striking distance of Tafahi from an airfield in the Republic of Fiji  I was determined to see the world 's first dawn and to greet the first people on the planet true Pacific people at that who were planning to take a stab at their day 
Rupert Murdoch owns a newspaper in Fiji which claims to be the first with the world 's news  In that his is a daily paper and that Fiji is quite close to the Date Line probably he is technically correct 
But in all other respects Tonga is more rightfully regarded as the closest place and has an International Date Line Hotel in the main town Nuku'alofa to prove it  On the floor of the lobby a place invariably filled with idle Tongan men of great girth is a brass bas-relief of the Line set in a marble sea 
Charles Dowd 's invention gleams dully in the half-gloom trodden upon by the sandals and the bare feet of a people who despite the name of their hotel take little obvious pleasure or pride in knowing their unique status  But one man knew and derived considerable pleasure from being where he was 
Paul Fabian the lone British diplomat who gloried in the title of Her Britannic Majesty 's High Commissioner in Tonga and Consul for the United States Island Possessions in the South Pacific had sent me a telex advising me that yes Tafahi was the first place in the world to receive the day 's new time and that moreover he had only very recently been there  I telephoned down a long and scratchy line 
We 're really looking forward to your coming I could hear him shouting  Would you like me to fix up an audience with the King here 
Perfectly easy if you 'd like to see him  I met Paul Fabian a few days later a small bird-like man quite bald dressed in a white safari suit and a Panama and in a perpetual state of fuss about sending telegrams to London 
First British diplomatic post in the world to open up each day you know he said proudly  That 's why you 're quite right to come down here to start your travels 
Perfect place  Complete Pacific symbol 
Admirable choice  Why not pop in for lunch 
Not frightfully busy here must admit  Quite a bit of spare time on the old hands 
Better check the wire machine and see if there 's anything from London  But there rarely was 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had rather greater concerns than Paul Fabian and his tiny High Commission and Residency on the seafront of Nuku'alofa  His was not a mission at the cutting edge of British diplomatic activity 
Governments would not be swayed nor would ministers tremble on receipt of elegantly crafted and crisply sarcastic Notes written by him on the antique encryption machine which could be seen in a corner of the office slowly rusting away in the hot salt air  Precisely why he had been sent to Tonga what special knowledge or circumstance was never explained and sitting as I did for many an evening on the veranda of the magnificent old Residency watching the fireflies and listening to the surf booming on the reef I was not too sorely tempted to enquire 
The Fabians had indeed been up to Tafahi about a month before  His Excellency showed me a film he had taken of the three northern islands of the Tonga group which being some 300 miles north of the main island are invariably overlooked by such few visitors as Tonga receives 
They were in fact the first of the so-called Friendly Islands to be seen by Europeans the Dutch navigators Willem Corneliszoon Schouten and Jacob LeMaire spotted them in April 1616  The Niuas as the trio are called are closer to both Samoa and Fiji than to the main Tongan group and it remains one of the odder quirks of Polynesian history that the islands belong to Tonga at all 
It also renders Tongan maps a most inconvenient shape to accommodate all the Friendly Islands and all the Tongan seas a scale map has to be about five times as long as it is wide though nearly all the population and commerce is bunched in the islands in the far south  The most geologically interesting and romantically appealing of the three islands is Niuafo'ou a sunken volcanic caldera set off to the west 
Almost perfectly circular it contains a virtually circular lake with another almost perfectly circular island in its centre the whole confection looking like a vast floating doughnut  There is a big bundle of feathers called the incubator bird which lays its eggs six feet down in the hot black sand and whose offspring emerge huge and fully feathered against the heat 
And there is a reputation among world stamp-collectors since the cliffs of Niuafo'ou are almost wholly steep-to and landings are fatally difficult mail is or was until very recently transferred to and from passing ships by swimmers who carried the outbound post in oilcloth bags and used bamboo poles to retrieve the inbound letters sealed in tin cans  Tin Can Island proclaim the postage stamps and old ones are said to be almost as sought after as British Guiana Triangulars or Penny Blacks 
The second island is Niuatoputapu small and triangular fringed by beaches of the purest white with palm trees and pandanus pines leaning into the ever-beating trade winds  This island seems overrun with small black pigs animals so much a part of Tongan life that when Captain Cook presented a pair of hitherto unknown Guernsey cows to the King they were classified as Cook 's pigs and the name has stuck for cows ever since and with Australian cruising yachties who use the Niuas as Schouten and LeMaire once did as the formal port of entry to the kingdom 
And then at latitude 15Â° 51 'S longitude 173Â° 43'W is the immense half-mile-high volcanic cone of Tafahi itself the island where time begins  It loomed in almost every frame of the Fabians ' film a sugar-loaf bottle-green and black its cliffs forbidding behind their skirt of angry white water 
The guide-books say little Samuel Wallis visited it and named it Boscawen Island perhaps after the great admiral of Finisterre the best vanilla in the Pacific is grown there and it is rumoured that the finest kavo that faintly narcotic drink prepared from the powdered root of a local pepper plant and an important part of rituals and celebrations in the South Pacific is Tafahi kava and that it renders all Tafahians perpetually slightly dopey  So there it lay 300 miles to the north utterly cut off from us by the hurricanes which according to the local weather men were raging back and forth nearby 
It certainly rained a great deal in Nuku'alofa the gales whipping up the surf into clouds of spume and sending broken branches spinning through the air  The High Commissioner 's Residency was flooded his collection of pandanus mats sodden his power lines brought down by falling trees 
There was a momentary crisis when the telex failed and he was cut off from London but two Tongan soldiers arrived on his doorstep in the middle of the storm saluted smartly acknowledged they realized his predicament and promised that his links with the outside world would be restored as a matter of the utmost priority  It turned out to be a matter of enlightened self-interest for Tonga too since the first thing Mr Fabian did when his line was restored was to pen a telegram to London demanding immediate aid for the islands 
And he got it by return a promise of a few hundred pounds'-worth of schoolbooks for which the government of Tonga gave due thanks  The Tonga Chronicle gave due prominence to the storm the following week though they might have wished for more careful sub-editing. $10 damage as islands hit by hurricane read the headline 
But readers were also given a piece of gummed paper to stick after the figure ten written on which was the missing word million  Friendly Islands Airways the somewhat informally organized internal airline lost one of its three planes in the storm spoiling my chances of making an early start for the airstrip on Niuatoputapu 
And the inter-island ship the Nanasipau'u which might have given me a lift up north chose to ride out the wind in the lee of the island unwisely put down both anchors promptly snapped both chains and then drifted helplessly out to sea  When the weather calmed her master spent several days trawling for the missing anchors with grapnels in what the charts said was 30 fathoms of water 
He never found anything when I left he was waiting for a new pair to be brought up from Auckland and wondering if the insurance company would cough up  So I waited and waited 
And I put in a request to see His Majesty the King  I had first spied King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV GCVO GCMG KBE sitting in the royal box in church at Sunday service the week before 
Like most Tongan men he was a mighty figure reputedly weighing nearly a quarter of a ton  The King had his eccentric side 
In particular he was given to unusual enthusiasms  His personal fondness for the sayings of the Reverend Swaggart marked him as a man somewhat out of step with much of the rest of the world a view reinforced by his apparent keenness on the suggestion of a freebooting American marine that the kingdom become a dumping-ground for spent atomic waste and noxious chemicals 
Knowing his passion for cycling on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and rowing on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays I had mentioned in my letter that I had stroked my boat somewhat ingloriously for two Torpids and two Summer Eights  It seemed as good a way of ingratiating myself as any other the palace was a protective place and there was no automatic guarantee that a visiting journalist would be granted an audience 
Tales of Tongan royal oarsmanship had recently spread as far afield as Hawaii and Tahiti and I reasoned that it could do no harm to mention my interest albeit one or two decades old  It worked next morning there was a note for me in the Date Line Audience with HM the King 2 pm in the royal palace 
Please wear a tie  Our meeting was delayed for ten minutes 
I had been ushered into the throne room the throne itself 8 feet high and needing six men to move it was carved from a solid slab of oak and had been presented to Queen Salote by the British Government in 1951 and could hear from next door the awful warble of Mr Swaggart 's daily broadcast to which the King was apparently listening  The room was crammed with the bric-Ã -brac of kingship the usual gifts from brother heads of state around the world dolls in glass cases a vivarium two portraits of George Bush seals of visiting warships a porcelain plate from the Republic of China which keeps a one-man embassy in Nuku'alofa a map of the moon presented by Mr Reagan statuettes umbrellas a humidor and any number of sets of engraved Waterford glass 
There was an elephantine stirring from beyond the arras the heavy footfall of leather sandals on worn carpets and the King appeared  He puffed asthmatically 
Welcome welcome  You have something to drink 
I think the passion-fruit juice is very good this season  You have come from very far 
From England I think  Now tell me is the Manchester Guardian still printed in Manchester 
I had heard it may have moved  Indeed it had some twenty years before 
Ah well he chortled  In Tonga we hear things a little late 
But you have come I am told became we are the first place on earth to get the dawn  Last with everything else first with the dawn a fine irony is n't it and chortling again he poured more passion-fruit juice into the Waterford glass 
We talked of toxic wastes the possibility of there ever being true democracy in Tonga on paper the place is ripe for revolution it is true and our friends in the other islands are experiencing troubled times so we must be wary the complaints about corruption among the Tongan nobility the curious business arrangements engineered between members of the royal family and the dubious Americans who were forever fetching up at the palace doorstep wishing to bend a royal ear to this scheme or that with wealth and fame for all and the most surprising news his decision to demolish the royal palace  The King wanted to take me round the garden 
He showed me the grass on which Tu'i Mala was wont to graze Tu'i Mala being a blind Galapagos tortoise which Captain Cook presented to the Tongans in 1777 and which died in 1966 at well over two hundred years old  He showed me the stands of Norfolk pines which shaded the palace and the view of the seafront with a new sea-wall being put up by a Japanese firm 
A white Range Rover passed the Union flag snapping from a small mast on the bonnet  The King waved in a desultory way 
Your Mr Fabian off to collect his letters from home I daresay  Such a nice fellow do n't you think 
He walked me slowly out to the garden gate a kindly old man more interested in his trees and his plans for the palace his rowing and his cycling than in the ruder demands of his people for democracy and good government  I wondered as we strolled across the lawn whether he might not in fact turn out to be the last King of Tonga the final member of a brief and moderately distinguished dynasty 
True there was Crown prince Tupouto'a waiting in the wings but he spent little time in Tonga and had a reputation as a playboy a Farouk-like figure given to white suits and expensive lady friends  He might not be quite the regal material the Tongan people were looking for and as his wheezing old father born in 1918 still fit but neither infallible nor immortal tottered around the herbaceous borders I fancied or perhaps dreaded that soon we might see the kingdom fall and a republic rise in its place and the monarchy he represented fall victim to the spirit of the age as ancient and outworn as Captain Cook 's old tortoise 
We reached the low white picket-fence the only insulation from his subjects that he cared to have  The only protection too 
Flimsy eh  Would n't stop anyone who really wanted to get me 
He grasped my hand and shook it warmly  So glad you came to see us 
Have fun watching the dawn  I shall still be in my bed 
But I enjoy knowing that the first sun in the world will warm you here in these islands  It makes me rather proud 
That and you having been an oarsman too  Really rather proud 
It was another day before the winds died the seas settled and the Friendly Islands Airways craft was hammered into serviceable shape  And then at 4 am one pitch-dark morning I found myself where all along I had planned to be standing on a steep hillside on a clifftop waiting for the sun to rise on the world 's first dawn of the day 
It was a Saturday the middle of February  The night had been unusually cool and a slight drizzle was falling 
Down below me the surf thrashed and thundered the Tonga Trench a precipitous crack in the ocean floor where two of the planet 's great tectonic plates crunched together and were folded downwards to melt again lay a score of miles away  The water was 22,000-ft deep off these islands though down further south near Kermadec it was seven miles to the bottom 
But even here I was on the very lip of the world peering over one of the suture lines of the globe and into the darkness of yesterday  I had entertained many hopes for this morning 
I had imagined for instance that I would be able to catch a glimpse of Mount Silisili a mile-high peak in the centre of Samoa just a few miles away across the water I had hoped to do so for no better reason than that Mount Silisili would be enjoying precisely the same clock time as here in Tonga but exactly one day before  So if I saw the mountain outlined by the rising sun at dawn I could say to myself that though it was Saturday morning here what I was witnessing at the same moment was dawn on Friday the day before 
The simultaneous sighting of two periods of time separated by an entire 24 hours seemed a paradox well worth experiencing  Then again I had this vague vision a pure fantasy that schoolchildren would rise from their beds in this tiny village and would file down to school carrying Japanese-made microcomputers to help them with their sums and their essays 
That it seemed would be the kind of icon I needed a truly Pacific emblem that of South Sea island children beginning the first learning of the world 's new day and doing so by using California-invented high-technology packaged sold and marketed by the Japanese  Everything about this little scene related to the Ocean with which I had become so enraptured if ever the peoples of the Pacific were to take over the running of the world I fancied it would start with people such as these using such things in a place like this 
And so I waited for the darkness of the Tongan night to lift my fingers tightly crossed  In the event the reality was as different and as perversely non-emblematic as it could be 
For a start it continued to drizzle  The dawn when finally it came up did so neither like thunder nor rosy-fingered 
Instead the horizon became vaguely apparent an uneven charcoal line separating the inky sea below from a deep grey stain of sky above  The stain lightened slowly to reveal lowering clouds moving in from the north the sea became less ink-like too and showed itself as a mess of enormous and ever-moving swells picked out here and there by off-white skeins of spray 
The fringing reef came into view as well a ragged line of breakers huge walls of spume and the ocean hurling itself relentlessly against the coral  If Samoa Mount Silisili and yesterday were indeed somewhere out there I would have to take their presence on trust I doubt if the visibility was more than five miles and less as the squalls rolled in and drenched me in my eyrie 
As the day began so the village started to pull itself together  The gloom rolled back until I could see six or seven huts they were grass-roofed mean little constructions of board and lath surrounded by muddy pools by which dozens of small black pigs were wagging their corkscrew tails and chasing each other over the cliffs 
Two or three wet and rather forlorn-looking dogs lounged in the mud  At about 6 o'clock a light snapped on in one of the huts 
I could hear curses and grunts clothes being pulled on and the familiar twang as cheap bedsprings were relieved of their customary pressure  I readied my notebook 
After all this was an important moment a time to savour  Whoever was about to emerge from beneath the dripping straw roof of this tiny hut on this minute hamlet on the eastern edge of this unknown volcanic islet was the first person in the world to rise on this February Saturday morning Homo Pacificus the symbol of all I had travelled half a world to see 
He would I knew be an immense and magnificent man his shirt half open his ta'ovala mat secured with its waistband of coconut fibre  He would spy me and bellow malo e lelei 
I could wish for nothing more unless of course his daughter followed bearing a Toshiba lap-top computer and skipped down the hill to school  The door creaked open 
The figure framed in the light was shorter than I had expected thin and stooped he looked up at the sky and cursed a guttural curse then started buttoning his fly  He wore no ta'ovala no coconut-fibre belt 
I coughed and he looked up a grey little man with spectacles standing there in the mud surrounded by the squabbling pigs he looked the very antithesis of magnificent immensity  Rubbing his glasses clean he peered intently over at me through the thin rain 
GrÃ¶ss Gott he exclaimed  He came a little closer and his face broke into a lopsided grin half amazed half delighted 
Guten Morgen mein Herren he said  Wilkommen in Tonga 
It turned out that my Homo Pacificus came from Dusseldorf  There was I realized an easy explanation 
Tonga had signed a treaty with Germany in 1876 and there had been a German coaling station on Vava'u  Then at the end of the century Britain fearing for her own security in the trans-Pacific sea-lanes swapped rights to Tongan waters with those she had in Samoa giving Samoan trading rights to Germany and the United States and keeping Tonga 's for the Empire 
The corollary is that British influence in Tonga is still immense but Germany still has relict links from before 1899 and this dampish little Dusseldorfer was a case in point  His sister he explained had married a Tongan and the couple now lived in Mainz not perhaps the most attractive of men he had been invited out to stay among the substantial ladies of the islands to see if he too could forge any links 
Thus far he had not enjoyed any success  A moment later and the girls of the house tumbled out Sophia Anna and Salome 
All large cheerful girls in their late teens to my great relief they wore long skirts and mats around their waists tied as tradition dictates with a braided kiekei band  They asked me in for tea and we all listened to the morning news on Radio Tonga crackling over the miles from the aerials down in Tongatapu 
The King the announcer said was leaving that night to attend the funeral of the Emperor of Japan  Salome the most talkative and pretty of the trio took me aside 
Training to be a teacher and with a wisdom that belied her years she explained that it was her half-brother who was now living in Mainz and had suggested that Erich the Dusseldorfer travel down to Tonga to look for a wife  But he is rather lacking in grace Salome said 
It is unlikely he will go back successful  There is very little connection now between our people and you Europeans 
We prefer to take our husbands from among each other  Not like the old days when we looked up to you 
Now we have our own pride and people like him have no place here  I was enormously glad she had made that little speech for the mere sight of Erich the knowledge that a man who worked as a painter in a Ford Taunus factory and was in his own way a type-specimen of Atlantic man with no known connections with the new Ocean had somehow fetched up on a remote Pacific island was disturbing the entire thesis I wished to construct 
There was no use pretending it had n't happened I had wished for a pure Pacific experience a truly new world experience at the dawning of this day yet it had become hopelessly muddied with a relic of the old world and the Ocean whose time we are now supposed to believe has passed  But Salome had placed it all perfectly in context and by doing so had made Erich an unwitting ally to the theme 
For of course the Pacific is still influenced by the Atlantic that once dominated the world the ties that bound the world together yesterday personified by the men and women who came out from the West to trade or to peddle religion to colonize annex smuggle or fight these ties still exist today though more weakly with less influence and fewer and fewer people enrolled in the process  The crucial difference now is as Salome had declared and is as true on a small and insubstantial island group like Tonga as in the capitals of Japan Chile Queensland or Korea the difference is that the peoples of the Pacific no longer have a reason to look up to those adventurers from the old Atlantic 
They have their pride their new confidence and assertiveness  We are a Pacific people I heard said on many occasions and we are proud 
I said my farewells to Salome and her sisters and shook hands with Erich who gave me a sheaf of letters to airmail when I got back to Hong Kong  A boat returned me to the little coral landing-strip Friendly Islands Airways took me down to Tongatapu and within half a day I was settled in a small hotel in Auckland waiting for the weekly Cathay Pacific jet home 
I had seen the island where time begins and had come to the sorry realization that the Pacific the vastest of all oceans is a far more complicated entity if indeed it could ever be regarded as such than it was possible to imagine  For if nothing else by the time I had flown another twelve hours north from Auckland and my jet had settled me on to the runway at Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong I was still on the periphery of the Pacific Ocean 
I was still in a place washed by the waters which had thundered off Tonga where there was a king with a nation of Brobdingnagian subjects a million pigs and a tradition of wearing clothes made of pandanus leaves and coconut string  I was still on the shores of the same great sea and yet had been transported into quite another world a place on the edge of a China which seemed to have nothing in common with those islanders so forgotten and so far away 
Except of course the Ocean itself  Trite though it may sound the Pacific unlike its sister seas is an ocean of many worlds indeed and at the same time by being so has become the world ocean as dominant and all-encompassing as its immensity suggests it has to be 
To fathom its many mysteries to grasp its vastness and try to understand its wholeness I then realized would be a very considerable task  The event that set the modern Pacific on its unrelenting climb towards world dominion happened by an entirely appropriate coincidence to be the first ever shown clear across America on coast-to-coast television 
The inauguration of the 3,000-mile link of co-axial cables and microwaves took place on an unusually hot Saturday morning 8 September 1951 for the reporting of the momentous happenings then reaching their climax in the gaudy and Italianate opera house in San Francisco  The ceremonial that unrolled before the cameras was displayed just as it happened on television sets black and white only in living rooms offices and bedrooms from Presque Isle in Maine to Key West in Florida and in all salient points between such as New York Pittsburgh and Washington DC 
The event that prompted this sudden electronic integration of the nation with all the then unrecognized implications good and bad for those who lived there was the formal signing of the Japanese peace Treaty  This treaty written on a mammoth parchment document that was said to hold more signatures than any other treaty in world history was signed by 49 of the participants in the Second World War 
It formally returned to Japan the sovereignty she had lost in her atomic-bombed defeat and enabled her to recommence her ambitious ascent towards economic supremacy a climb which though frustrated and corrupted before was this time and at last to culminate in her present astonishing success  And with Japan 's success came the beginnings of the Ocean 's success a new economic axis had been created 
However the era of the Pacific probably had its true beginnings nearly a century before and at the behest of that most unremembered of all American presidents Millard Fillmore  No other act of his dismal presidency deserves mention but in an irony perhaps lost on his many detractors his single decision in March 1852 to despatch a naval expedition to Japan under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry has had an ineradicable effect on world history 
Perry 's foray to the Orient marked the true beginning of America 's global role it marked the emergence on the world stage of Japan after two centuries of a xenophobia that almost bordered on paranoia and it allowed the creation nervous at first but gradually becoming more and more pronounced of a trans-Pacific axis between put at its most basic California and Honshu an axis around which the fortunes of today 's Ocean and much of today 's world revolves  America 's interest in the Pacific dating from the end of the eighteenth century was almost certainly fired by the telling in dockside bars and merchants ' cafÃ©s of gaudily embroidered tales of the explorations of Captain Cook why the mariners of Boston and New York wondered out loud should the Ocean that washed their continent 's western shores be traversed and charted by a navigator all the way from North Yorkshire and by Frenchmen and Portuguese too 
And so in the early years of the nineteenth century American sailors set out in contest the seaward extension of those landlubbers who to use John L. O'Sullivan 's famous phrase of 1845 sought their manifest destiny on land by expanding ever westward to the very edge of the continental United States  Those mariners set about whaling settling plundering they established a presence in Hawaii they shared with Britain the spoils of the Chinese treaty ports they took Samoa they befriended Korea they seized and settled Midway Wake Guam and a spoil of an Imperial war the Philippines thus creating a series of stepping-stones a lifeline of tropical islands that led all the way to that greatest and most elusive prize the Middle Kingdom China 
But the most notable act of all this trans-Pacific ambition when seen from today 's vantage point if not necessarily so at the time was President Fillmore 's decision to send out Commodore Perry and his black ships to bring sense to the isolationist shoguns who in almost Carthusian seclusion ran the state of Nihon  Matthew Calbraith Perry with his minuscule armada of two frigates and two sailing vessels arrived at the heavily fortified pod of Uraga at the very mouth of Tokyo Bay on 8 July 1853 
Japanese warships puny in the extreme surrounded him  The Commodore refused pointblank to leave 
He would he insisted complete his mission to deliver a pouch of documents from President Fillmore by force if no one was deputed to receive the papers personally  Despite their stubborn pride and the risk of loss of face the Japanese soon realized that Perry 's ships were far superior to their own 
They withdrew their blockade and sent their prince Toda to collect the package  In what was regarded then as some perverse flourish of American protocol Admiral Perry then gave the papers to two of his black mariners the best-looking fellows of their colour that the squadron could furnish and instructed them to hand them over 
They were to deliver with the greatest of courtesy the inaugural diplomatic traffic between the newly-emerging America and the soon-to-emerge Japan  The initial shock felt by the Japanese wore off quickly enough once they had read the letters and considered their implications 
The Commodore was back in Tokyo Bay seven months later in the depths of the following winter  This time he came with nine ships and a determination to win agreement from the Japanese and he did precisely that concluding a treaty of peace and friendship that unknown to all its signatories was to have consequences of shattering proportions 
The collapse of the shogunate and the restoration of the Meiji throne was but one effect from which a myriad of others flowed the revival of Japanese nationalism and her imperial designs the invasion of China the florid plans for a Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere the bombast and cruelty of the Pacific War the creation in America of the atomic bomb its eventual use over the two great cities of Kyushu and Japan 's consequent defeat post-war disgrace ruin and decay  All of this it can surely be argued flowed seamlessly from that fateful meeting between two black American sailors and a princely envoy from the Kyoto court in the harbour at Uraga and by the handover of a letter written by a president who less than a year later would be languishing in Bukalo in the beginnings of what should be by this reckoning alone quite undeserved historical obscurity 
It took the San Francisco peace Treaty of 1951 to place the official seal of international forgiveness on Japan 's decade of distemper after which and ever since Japan has raced ahead without once looking back achieving all she had sought by war and conquest without the firing of a single shot or shell  Few commentators at the time saw in the conference the beginnings of the Pacific age 
Most were far too taken with the spectacle of Andrei Gromyko then the Soviet Union 's deputy Foreign Minister trying and failing to break the conference apart  The newspaper-reading public and the television audience of some 40 million who had never before been treated to live pictures from the Californian coast revelled in the pictures of Gromyko and his polish and Czech wrecking crew as John Foster Dulles put it who complained harangued sulked and finally walked out as amendment after amendment was defeated by the other conferees 
All praise was given to Dean Acheson the conference chairman for his handling of the Reds and there were lurid tales told by a reporter who smuggled himself into the Soviets ' rented mansion disguised as a plumber socks and panties dangled orange peels littered the floors five to seven beds had been squeezed into every bedroom  There was even supposed to be a plot to assassinate Gromyko by ramming a beer truck into his motorcade and a meat truck did overturn on the road shortly before the cars were due 
America was fascinated by the Russians ' presence in their prettiest city and duly ignored the real significance of what was going on  It took well over an hour for the first 48 delegates who included no Soviet bloc nation nor India nor Burma nor either of the Chinas nor a scattering of other countries who could not bring themselves to accept Japan 's word to file up to the podium to sign 
And then with a solemnity and dignity appropriate to the moment the Japanese prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida stepped up to sign  He had flown in via Honolulu but reportedly had not deigned to glance over at the still-visible wreckage of Pearl Harbor just off the runway 
He and his five brother delegates though there were 74 in the full Japanese team and 70 correspondents were dressed in morning coats and striped trousers to show Japan 's modesty and sincerity as Yoshida said  They signed and the war was officially over the peace had begun 
Very few of the seers got it right  Freda Kirchwey writing in The Nation came close 
already the British are worrying about cheap Japanese goods flooding markets absolutely essential to the export trade  Norway is worried about fishing rights 
Many nations are apprehensive because the treaty establishes no controls to prevent the ruthless industrial and trading practices that built Japan 's pre-war commercial empire  And all the powers fear the rapid rise of Japan 's war-making capacity industrial and political as well as military 
They know that a new balance of power in Asia has been created by the Treaty  already the British are worrying about cheap Japanese goods flooding markets absolutely essential to the export trade 
Norway is worried about fishing rights  Many nations are apprehensive because the treaty establishes no controls to prevent the ruthless industrial and trading practices that built Japan 's pre-war commercial empire 
And all the powers fear the rapid rise of Japan 's war-making capacity industrial and political as well as military  They know that a new balance of power in Asia has been created by the Treaty 
By new balance of power Freda Kirchwey and most other writers who made this same point meant a balance between Japan Korea Formosa China and the Soviet Union  There was little thought that the balance would ultimately rest between the two old enemies Japan and the United States nor that the entire Pacific Ocean and all the countries around it were to become to a greater or lesser extent dependent upon and in thrall to these two protagonists in the conference 
As everyone left clutching the fountain pens and the sugar-pastry city crests handed out by an exuberant San Francisco mayor so the world 's thoughts were principally and thankfully concentrated on the reality that one war was now definitely over while another that raging across the Ocean in Korea was beginning to look as though it might end soon  It did not 
The idea of the emergent Pacific was not in anyone 's mind and in any case the reality of it was not to appear for many years  But it did steal up on us in the way eras have a habit of doing some time in the late Sixties and early Seventies 
The West the Atlantic world may have been firing rockets to the moon and fighting a war in Indochina but the benefit of hindsight indicates now that in other ways it was gripped by a blinkered and introspective mood absorbed by its own internal problems  Understandably so for these problems were grave indeed the Kennedys had been killed likewise Dr King the streets of Paris and London were furious with the sounds of protest the cities and university towns of America were in turmoil race relations the draft mind-expanding drugs the Weather Underground Dylan Daley psychedelia the National Guard a cause for a riot bomb or occupation was to be found everywhere every day 
It was not a time for students of the world to ponder the great matters of global history to care about the great beyond to notice the unleashing of distant energies  Yet being unleashed they most certainly were 
The turning point the moment when the era rightly began came during those years between America 's Sixties triumph Neil Armstrong 's first footsteps on the Sea of Tranquillity in 1969 and that most doleful moment of the Seventies when the last US Marines were evacuated from the roof of the embassy in Saigon in 1975  And the indicator of the moment regrettably has to be a statistic the simple fact that from the late Sixties and the early Seventies onward more than half the world 's goods and services more than half the world 's trade had its origins within the domain of the Pacific Ocean 
If in no other sense than economic the world 's focus had switched from East to West from Greenwich to the Date Line from Atlantic to Pacific  This part of the planet meant business 
Statistics unpalatable indigestible and ephemeral though they may be tell much of the story of the world 's sudden recognition of the Pacific  Some such as those asserting that most of the world 's people now live around the Ocean are questionable as will be explored shortly 
Others which display the higher growth rates of the Pacific countries the greater per capita incomes of their peoples and the steadily increasing volumes of iron ore oil and containerized trade crossing the Pacific are powerful indicators of an undeniable trend  But though statistics are objective icons for the disinterested observer or powerfully distorting tools for the polemicist once in a while a particular set of figures will leap from the page of some dust-dry tome to offer up an image more illuminating than all of a dozen reports like those in the bibliography relating to this chapter 
Others interested in this Ocean may have already found their choicest figures the one that brought the Pacific 's surge so very much alive for me when hitherto it had been no more than the muffled beatings of a warm blue and very distant sea related to an event seven miles above the surface of the earth some time during a night in 1984  Probably though this can never be wholly proven the night of Friday 4 May 1984 
Like any wide expanse of sea the Pacific Ocean is criss-crossed with commercial air-routes  These are flying lanes arranged more or less like the lanes of a superhighway each given a name and a number all clearly designated on maps and designed by the International Civil Aviation Organization 's Air Navigation Commission to allow civil aircraft to fly in relative safety when far from land 
To say the Pacific is criss-crossed is perhaps too strong the Atlantic has a number of routes that cross each other and its Jepperson high-altitude charts are so filled with intersecting lines that to an untutored eye they resemble the early stages of weaving  In contrast the Pacific being so huge and travelled across by aircraft that tend at least for now to fly principally between East and West and back again manages to contain its major routes within a few distinct bands 
The five main roads that run between Anchorage and Tokyo are the main tracks across the Pacific for aircraft running between any of the American or Canadian west coast airports on the one hand and any of the Asian traffic centres Tokyo Seoul Taipei or Hong Kong on the other  These routes known as ATSs or Air Traffic Separation routes are designated Red 220 Red 580 Amber 590 Red 591 and Green 344 and they carry the bulk of traffic across the Ocean 
Pilots using them plot their journeys across the uninterrupted emptiness of the Pacific by plotting a course between a series of way-points random but fixed points above the Ocean that are each given five-letter nonsense names Neeva Nytim Nokka Nabie among a host of others from above which the planes report their positions to the Pacific 's oceanic control centres at Tokyo Anchorage and Oakland California  These heavily-travelled perpetually busy airways are supplemented by others currently less hectic but growing fast both in use and consequence 
There is for instance a route between Tokyo and Honolulu known because it is not fixed in cement as it were as the TYO-HNL Flexible Track System which carries millions upon millions of Japanese to and from honeymoons and shopping expeditions there are routes now between Honolulu and San Francisco between Honolulu and Nadi in Fiji and pronounced Nandi Nadi and Tokyo and Nadi and Sydney between Los Angeles and points south-west  Fiji despite its relative economic unimportance has become a major centre for air traffic controlling refuelling stopovers and crew changes 
Oceanic controllers there as well as in Honolulu and Auckland watch the blips on their radars or plot positions of unseen aircraft on immense plastic charts as do French-speaking specialists hunched over their radar screens outside Papeete in Tahiti  To the north and west of these last the skies are cluttered only to the east of Tahiti is the Ocean left to its own devices 
This then was the situation on what I shall call that Friday early in the northern summer of 1984  It was late on Friday evening in London in the cities of the western Pacific Tokyo Hong Kong Seoul Vladivostok Sydney it was early Saturday morning 
In those of the eastern Pacific San Francisco Hawaii Easter Island Anchorage Pitcairn it was mid-afternoon on Friday  Professor Dowd 's line dividing Friday from Saturday rendered it late Saturday morning in Tonga and slightly later on Friday morning in Samoa just a couple of hundred miles away 
So the exact time and day of this statistically important happening depends very much on where it was recorded  Since planes tend to fly by Greenwich Mean Time it is convenient to say it took place on the evening of the Friday 
What happened is recorded as a statistic  There are about 700 Boeing 747s in operation around the world and rather fewer Douglas DCI0s and Lockheed Lloll Tri-Stars the so-called jumbo jets the wide-bodies those given the suffix heavy as in Cathay Pacific 200-Heavy by the air traffic controllers 
Until that Friday night slightly more than half the planes actually up in the sky flying between the cities with runways that can handle wide-bodied jets were doing so across the Atlantic Ocean  They were flying between London and New York Philadelphia and Frankfurt New Orleans and Madrid MontrÃ©al and Paris Chicago and Lagos Rio and Cape Town Buenos Aires and the Canary Islands and a score of other places besides 
But from late that Friday night the scene suddenly shifted  Most of the world 's big planes known to be in the air at that time were recorded by the traffic controllers as being not above the Atlantic Ocean at all but above the Pacific 
It was a development that had been long foreseen and it was inevitable  But somehow of all the facts and figures that had and have been adduced to bolster the arguments in favour of the dawning of a new Pacific age this one seemed the most appropriate 
The jumbo jet is after all one of the most potent symbols of this century  The simple statistical confirmation that the majority of them were from 1984 onwards and probably from that particular Friday though one can not be certain in the skies above the Pacific Ocean was for me and I suspect for most who came to know the first and final affirmation that from now on this part of the world was the centre of things 
Official recognition of the change came thick and fast during the presidency of Ronald Reagan  In June 1984 a scant four weeks after the jumbo jet statistic became known in the world 's aviation lobbies the president made a particularly memorable speech 
He was in Dublin an improbable place for a display of Pacific oratory when he declared  This century has brought the Pacific nations many hardships and many difficulties and differences remain 
But what I found everywhere on a recent tour was energy optimism and excitement  More and more there is a sense of common destiny and possibility for all the peoples of this great region 
The vast Pacific has become smaller but the future of those who live around it is larger than ever before  This century has brought the Pacific nations many hardships and many difficulties and differences remain 
But what I found everywhere on a recent tour was energy optimism and excitement  More and more there is a sense of common destiny and possibility for all the peoples of this great region 
The vast Pacific has become smaller but the future of those who live around it is larger than ever before  Then again in a later speech the president warmed to his theme You can not help but feel that the great Pacific basin with all its nations and all its potential for growth and development that is the future 
Or The Pacific is leading mankind into a new age of enterprise and progress  The Pacific Basin is being transformed into one of the most dynamic and productive regions in the world 
The pattern of growth stability and co-operation found in this region offers a unique and promising vision for the future  And finally in the same year all trace of the tentative vanished The Pacific is where the future of the world lies 
After such endorsements from a man who despite being a migrant from the Mid-West has been transformed instinctively into a prime example of Homo Pacificus it would have been a foolish and almost unpatriotic American who professed otherwise  And so come the mid- and late 1980s the rhetoric flooded forth 
At Georgetown soirÃ©es and Bel Air fund-raisers in the think-tanks and the magazine offices in the halls of academe and dare one say it in the offices of publishers the Pacific suddenly became fashionable  A phenomenon Pacific chic began to arrest the attentions of those on the dinner-party circuit and it became desirable nay essential for the United States to think Pacific be Pacific though with a capital P and above all to develop a Pacific policy 
There is a shift in the centre of gravity of US foreign policy said a State Department seer Mr Lawrence Eagleburger from the trans-Atlantic relationship toward the Pacific basin and particularly Japan.  There is now a new reality in the world said George Shultz the Secretary of State though the world may not comprehend it 
In economic development in the growth of free institutions and in growing global influence the Pacific region has rapidly emerged as a leading force on the world stage a sense of Pacific community is emerging  Sometimes the rhetoric became positively and absurdly hyperbolic 
Senator Gary Hart who in 1985 was busily courting public attention for his attempt on the American presidency declared that we are all members of the community of nations surrounding the Pacific  The Pacific has become the twentieth century 's fountain of youth 
And further Economically a governor of California declared the sun is now rising in the West  The Russians were not backward in coming forward either 
In July 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev speaking in the great Pacific port of Vladivostok the name means Rule the East made what turned out to be a seminal address displaying the Soviets ' keen interest in the region  He spoke of the renaissance in world history that was taking place along the rim of the Pacific and declared that his country the greater part of which he told his audience lay East of the Urals was about to develop a coherent attitude towards it and its people 
The situation in the Far East in Asia and the Ocean expanses adjoining it where we are permanent inhabitants and seafarers of long standing is to us of national state interest  Mr Gorbachev 's words and the wave of shrewd and generally conciliatory diplomatic actions that followed sent a tremor through the American diplomatic establishment 
The Pacific it had long been supposed was America 's private playground no super-power had bothered about the Ocean before and the assumption of American naval supremacy in its blue waters was unchallenged  There were the inevitable demands that the new Soviet threat be repulsed the United States some thought should forget about the Europeans and concentrate its diplomatic and military skills entirely on the Pacific 
Wiser counsel suggested a more cautious approach  Mr Paul Wolfowitz President Reagan 's State Department specialist on the subject did indeed talk of the United States reasserting our appropriate role in the Pacific region a very strong and involved role and even many foreign observers give President Reagan a large share of the credit for that 
But the whole process of reassertion and realignment must be performed with care  We must pay great attention to the Pacific as it is one of the most important regions of the world 
But if we do that at the expense of other vital interests we will have made a mistake  But the underlying theme was that expressed by a Japanese Zenko Suzuki in 1982 a theme that has since proved an undeniable stimulus to politicians and rhetoricians in need of a new and very positive cause 
We are today standing at a historic crossroads Mr Suzuki told a conference in most appositely Hawaii a crossroads where the many civilizations encounter each other in this Pacific region  We are witnessing the birth of a civilization which nurtures ideas and creativity precisely because it is so rich in diversity 
This is the beginning of the Pacific Age an age which will open the doors into the 21st century  Mr Suzuki 's flourishes merely echoed and embellished words that had been uttered with signal prescience almost exactly eighty years before by John Hay 
Western history Theodore Roosevelt 's Secretary of State declared in 1902 began with a Mediterranean era passed through an Atlantic era and is now moving into a Pacific era  And Hay himself was an echo of an even earlier huzza for the region 
William Seward President Lincoln 's Secretary of State the man who had committed the legendary folly of buying Alaska for rather more than $7 million made an even more provocative forecast in the mid-nineteenth century  The Pacific Ocean its shores its islands he said will become the great theatre of events in the world 's hereafter henceforth European commerce European thought and European connections although becoming more intimate will nevertheless sink in importance. 
Setting such contentions assertions aside it is evident that in terms of all the human and material resources it contains the Pacific is indeed a remarkable prize  But it is what the more energetic and motivated of these human resources her people have managed to do with the material resources that to quote from just three current claims which some might think exaggerated has triggered an economic revolution caught the rest of the world unprepared and given birth to a whole new era and a brand-new geography 
Many metaphors are used  On one rather bloodless level the phenomenon of the New Pacific is the consequence of what happens when all the curves by which we define a region 's resources suddenly reach their peaks simultaneously and produce a wave of dramatic geometric harmony the whole wave being far greater and more impressive than the sum of its component curves 
In a more romantic mode it is as though a thousand lone voices have suddenly and unexpectedly found common cause in one majestic chorus which is now drowning out the discordant notes heard from beyond the main stage  Or again it is as though the disorganized and random bursts of photons present in a beam of white light were suddenly all being accelerated and agitated to precisely the same frequency and directed at the same spot to produce the awesome source of energy that we have come to know as the laser 
But whether a wave a chorus or a laser is used as a metaphor the common feature to be found in all comparisons is quite simply power  The Pacific once merely big is now endowed with very considerable power which seems likely to grow and grow to a pitch that mathematicians will say is amenable to extrapolation but which is actually in terms of its effects quite unimaginable 
It will presumably then decline and some presently unconsidered part of the world perhaps Africa or Arabia will rise to prominence but for the moment there is little doubt that the Pacific era is beginning it will reach its full flower in perhaps two or three decades and will then enjoy or suffer the supremacy known to other oceans and regions in the decades and centuries past  How long it endures how long the Pacific wave will stand before it breaks how full the chorus sings until it wavers how long before the brilliance of the light begins to dim can not even be guessed 
A Library of Congress report on the region commissioned in 1986 began thus  The Asian Pacific Rim has been transformed in the past 25 years into a major world centre of commerce industry and economic activity 
The region today rivals North America and Europe in many of the key indicators of economic power  The unprecedented economic achievements of the region have forced governments and firms in North America and Europe to re-examine their polities and practices to remain internationally competitive and have led to predictions that the countries of the Asian Pacific Rim will eclipse North America and Europe as the centre of world economic power and dynamism in the 21st century 
They are growing at breathtaking rates  The Asian Pacific Rim has been transformed in the past 25 years into a major world centre of commerce industry and economic activity

They are growing at breathtaking rates  The figures are breathtaking too as a random sampling will illustrate 
In 1965 the Pacific countries leaving out the US and Canada-produced goods and services worth S183,000,000,000 sixty per cent less than that of Western Europe by 1985 this figure had increased eight-fold to $1,700,000,000,000 a mere thirty per cent less than Europe  The Pacific countries are now America 's largest trading partner they first outstripped the Europeans in 1985 when they sold goods worth $121 billions to the United States compared to the $116 billions'-worth that came from Southampton Marseilles Rotterdam and Hamburg 
Thirteen of the Pacific nations the US Canada Japan Australia New Zealand Hong Kong Malaysia Singapore Indonesia Thailand Brunei and the Philippines now account for half of the world 's growth  The four little tigers Hong Kong Singapore Taiwan and Korea have growth rates which at between eight and eleven per cent are more than double those for most of the rest of the world 
Germany grew at 2 per cent during the period 1973â€“84 Hong Kong grew nearly five times as rapidly  The western American states are in on the act too Oregon California and Alaska are growing at seven per cent twice the rate of the remainder of the country 
In 1950 the gross personal incomes of those living in the five Pacific states amounted to just over a quarter of those living in the 18 Atlantic states by 1982 it had risen to very nearly half  The population had gone up too from 30 per cent of the Atlantic states ' population in 1960 to 37 per cent in 1982 
The sum of the gross national products of Japan and China and the little tigers will by the year 2000 equal that of the United States  In 1995 Japan will own a tenth of all American assets a figure brought about in part because of the weakness of the dollar against the yen but also because the Japanese manage to save three times as much as do the Americans and have that much more spare money to invest 
Los Angeles is set to take over from New York as the busiest port in the world  Hong Kong shot past Rotterdam in 1987 to become the world 's busiest container port 
Forty per cent of American trade with the Pacific is carried on ships that arrive in the pod of San Francisco  In 1965 the Pacific countries leaving out the US and Canada-produced goods and services worth S183,000,000,000 sixty per cent less than that of Western Europe by 1985 this figure had increased eight-fold to $1,700,000,000,000 a mere thirty per cent less than Europe

The figures are almost endless  And what they all display rather too baldly though highly effectively is the simple economic importance of the Ocean 
What they do not tell however is the human dimension of the Pacific story the human reasons behind the staggering growth of the region the ways in which this virtuoso performance actually affects the lives of the men women and children of the Pacific and the ways in which the Pacific people are different in outlook aspirations fears and needs from those who live beyond the Ocean  The figures report on what and where and when the pages that follow will I hope give some answers to the how and most important to the why 
Why if the Pacific era is upon us has it all happened here  Ever since the Portuguese annexed Goa in 1510 the Europeans have had their eyes on or have in some ways dominated Asia and the Pacific Western ideas have triumphed here as everywhere else in the world 
But now at long last it seems as though this might be ending the much vaunted triumph of the West may be faltering in this its first confrontation with a region and a group of peoples who are as confident and as proud and as rich and powerful as the Westerners have long been  Yet is this really so could European dominion and the subsequent dominion of America really be at the beginning of a decline 
And further is it really possible given the varieties of people the gigantic distances and the vastly differing ideological systems to be found in the Pacific that this part of the world could assume the mantle of leadership  Could it triumph with its Galileos Einsteins Picassos Beethovens and Aristotles thinkers and seers of Pacific origin who will one day come to imprint their views and creations as firmly as did their Mediterranean and Atlantic forebears 
Or is it all an illusion a phantasm derived from mere figures a figment of journalistic imagination an evanescent creature of dream and the wishful thinking of those for whom history is proceeding too slowly and who would prefer to see an era change during their lifetimes rather than to live within the dulling envelope of merely one  I hope that the succeeding chapters will go at least some way towards building flesh and sinew face and character even if it happens to be as on Tafahi island a North German face and character on to the dry lifeless bones of economists ' figures 
On the face of the planet there lies assembled into one immense and complicated but always inter-connected body a quantity of some 329 million cubic miles of water the sea  This body because it contains fifty thousand million million tons of sodium chloride and similarly massive quantities of other dissolved salts is undrinkable by most living creatures but in scores of other ways is central vital indeed to the existence of all life 
What might at first seem an enormous volume of fluid accounts in fact for a mere one million million millionth of the total volume of the planet  A trifling proportion perhaps though students of the trivial are usually intrigued to learn that all the dissolved salts in the sea were they to be dried out would be enough to cover the entire land surface of the planet to a depth of 150 feet 
To better appreciate the size of the sea one can perhaps imagine it heaped up into a cube  Each side would be 690 miles long about the distance from London to Inverness or Washington to Atlanta 
But of course the water is not heaped up into a cube and so it is perhaps more appropriate though less convenient to think of this mass of salt water in its actual context as a veneer-thin skin which lurks in those troughs and valleys which fall below the mean circumference of the earth 's planetary spheroid  If the earth is thought of as a billiard ball then the water upon its face is like hammered gold leaf adhering to some imperfections in the ball more tightly than to others and in yet others not adhering at all 
It is held there and is permitted or forced to move only very slightly to and fro though in very complicated ways by the influences sometimes combined sometimes separate of that variety of proximate gravities exerted by the sun the moon and the nearer planets  Thanks to the condition of the atmosphere above it this body of water may appear at closer quarters either tranquil or chaotic storm-swept or calm 
Depending on its latitude and the season it may be a deep warm blue or an ugly tepid green or its surface may be frozen hard and white into ice on which creatures may walk  Depending on the geology the tectonics and thus the topography of the earth 's surface beneath it it may be many miles deep or some few fathoms shallow 
It invariably supports an unimaginably vast quantity of living creatures from submicroscopic unicellular beings via countless varieties of fish and plants and crustaceans to the mightiest whales and thus the mightiest living creatures that are known to exist  The sea is statistically a very much more impressive body than the land it surrounds 
For a start it is far larger 71 per cent of the earth 's surface is sea only 29 per cent dry land  Only in a very few latitudinal bands is there more land than sea thanks to Europe and Asia that stretching from 45Â°N to 70Â°N is dominated by land as is that because of Antarctica between 70Â°S and the South pole 
Elsewhere and particularly south of the equator the sea rules north of 84Â° there is no land at all and between 45Â°S and the Antarctic Circle there is to all intents and purposes none either just The Bluffs in New Zealand a sliver of Patagonia and a few islands unshakable relics of the British empire  The average depth of the sea is 12,430 feet much deeper than the average height of the land a mere 2,760 feet 
And the sea 's greatest known depth of 36,200 feet exceeds by more than a mile the height of Mount Everest  From mankind 's point of view the varying configurations of these 329 million cubic miles present a variety of conveniences and opportunities 
It is a body that simultaneously defines the continents and divides them from each other at the same time it knits together some of their distant and improbably linked civilizations as well as their anthropologies and histories  The water can be both a barrier to our travel and a pathway for our commerce 
It displays an endless variety of moods lonely majestic dangerous fickle and serene  It is always powerful 
Perhaps not always as immediately dramatic as an exploding volcano devastating earthquake nor a hurricane-force wind but in terms of a sustained exertion of strength it is probably the most powerful earth-borne entity known  The sea is the primal source of all living things on earth 
It is an immense graveyard thought of by some as a sacred and unspoiled resource  It is used by others by far too many as a dumping-ground for the unwanted the unsung the unspeakable 
For many it is the way home for others the way from home a medium that encourages escape change exchange and exile  Accordingly and because of its vast size the sea inspires the greatest emotional responses of loving and loathing among those who occupy their business upon its surface 
It can be the focus of inconsolable grief it inspires poetry and literature symphonies and songs  To any visitors from another planet it would be the most obvious and most dominant feature of this one 
But only lately have we come to think of it as one body however large and interconnected it may be  Not long ago geographers were wont to divide it into its most impressive component bodies and to call them the Seven Seas 
These were the Arctic and Antarctic the North and South Atlantic the North and South Pacific and the Indian Oceans  Other impressive bodies of water the Mediterranean the Caspian the Black the Baltic were not included in the list 
Slowly as geography became a more refined and philosophical diversion so this way of subdividing the sea evolved into the simpler concept of just Five Oceans the northerly and southerly subdivisions of the Atlantic and Pacific dropped we were left with the uncomplicated vastnesses of the Oceans Arctic Antarctic Atlantic Pacific and Indian  Then again at the turn of this century a geographer named Otto KrÃ¼mmell decided that both Seven and Five were too many and that there should be only the Three 
The Arctic and Antarctic Oceans KrÃ¼mmell decreed were simply polar integrands of those oceans which had equatorial legitimacy only these latter the Atlantic the Pacific and the Indian were in his scheme of things true oceans  The progressive simplification continues 
Today even more reduction has taken place now the more pedantically-minded geographers dispense with talk of any subdivisions perhaps hesitating to diminish so mighty a feature of the globe by paring it apart and apportioning its sections hither and yon  They now call it what an extraplanetary visitor a being unmoved by tales of historical discovery disinterested in the results of political argument and unaffected by the predicted consequences of commercial trends would probably call it himself 
They remind themselves that it is all linked one body of water one mass of 329 million cubic miles of brine and with unaffected simplicity they call it the World Ocean  For the purposes of this book however I plan to use Herr KrÃ¼mmell 's definition of 1897 from his Handbuch der Ozeanographie 
It is worth bearing in mind though that his three oceans are in fact all part of one and that their individual behaviours are all part of the overall behaviour of the planet 's hydrosphere where all winds and currents ambient temperatures and barometric pressures and just possibly all human behaviour too are part of one hugely complicated ever-mobile mathematically-insufferable and only marginally predictable global machine  The workings of the Atlantic Ocean are affected by what happens in the Indian Ocean 
The Indian Ocean pays close heed to what occurs in the Pacific Ocean  The Pacific is affected by everything and in turn it too affects everything else 
Taken alone the Pacific Ocean can be like any other defined in a variety of ways depending on whether the observer is a geographer geologist cartographer military strategist or fashionably up-to-date economist  Sometimes the definitions can border on the eccentric the American admiral who commands all his country 's ships airmen soldiers and marines in what the pentagon regards as the Pacific as in the admiral 's official title CINCPAC Commander-in-Chief Pacific holds sway over an ocean which has its westerly shores oft Mombasa and is arbitrarily cut off along a line running due south from the border between Mexico and Guatemala 
Thus the Pacific as seen from the pentagon 's decidedly Atlantic eyrie in Arlington Virginia includes all the Indian Ocean yet excludes that lo per cent of the true Pacific which abuts the coast of South America and even more surreal is actually administered from the office of the Commander-in-Chief Atlantic in Norfolk Virginia  The genesis of this particular definition which we might call the military Pacific has more to do with American imperial history than with logic 
But in recent years a more rigorously scientific approach has unwittingly given some credibility to it at least to the pentagon 's arbitrary gift of an eastern frontier for the Ocean  It is all to do with satellites 
The geostationary communications satellites placed high above the Pacific to link the banking and trading centres of South-East Asia Japan and Australasia with those of North America preside over a window of the planetary territory of geometrically fixed size rather as if a cone a dunce 's cap the height of which is equivalent to the altitude necessary for a satellite 's geostationary orbit had been set down over the ocean  The maximum diameter of this window at the equator is about 150Â° of longitude so for the satellite to be able say to see Singapore on the very western periphery of what one might call the economists Pacific' a definition we will consider m- a moment its window must end in the east somewhere near the longitude of Mexico City 
As indeed do the windows of most Pacific communications satellites  This is simple enough to test by observation 
Any international satellite dish one might see in Vancouver or Los Angeles will point toward its bird low on the western horizon the Pacific satellite  A dish in any Pacific city east of the longitude of Mexico City Lima say or Quito or Santiago will be cranked down in the direction of an equally low point on the eastern horizon for just as American naval vessels involved in exercises off the Pacific coasts of Peru Ecuador or Chile are regarded as being part of the US Atlantic Fleet so communicators for reasons of pure geometry think of these countries ' capital cities as part of the Atlantic communications network 
Balboa and Magellan might have found the classification very droll but the fact remains that for purposes of cartographic organizational and now administrative convenience the Pacific Ocean is simply-far too big  There are however more conventional definitions of the Ocean 's limits 
To a geologist for instance the Pacific Ocean is a very sharply defined depression of the earth 's surface which has been formed as a result of the complicated processes of plate tectonics  Put another way the area which can properly be called the tectonic Pacific is one of relatively low altitude that is bounded by a ring of islands and mountains which have been and are still being formed by the geological processes that occur when one tectonic plate bumps into and grinds against another 
The main and more or less stable plate that dominates the area is known hardly surprisingly as the Pacific Plate surrounding it are a number of equally large or smaller plates such as the Australian the Nazca the North American and the Cocos Plate  Were one to define the Pacific in terms of its tectonics alone then it would be a sea considerably shrunk from that to which we are accustomed 
Its boundary the boundary of the Pacific plate would follow the west coast of North America but it would then turn sharply south and pass to the seaward as it were of both the Galapagos archipelago and Easter Island before curving to the south of New Zealand along the spine of South Island and emerging back into the sea near the hot mud springs of Rotorua  The Pacific boundary-line would then pass to the seaward of Tonga and Fiji curve back westwards to New Guinea head north and east through Guam and Iwo Jima pass off the eastern shores of the Japanese chain head up to Kamchatka and rejoin the North American continent off the Aleutians 
This supposed boundary of the Pacific plate almost exactly parallels what was once called the Andesite Line a zone surrounding the Pacific on the outer edge of which are found rocks of an andesitic acid variety and within which nearly all the rocks are of a more basic kind using the word in its chemical sense  In excessively crude shorthand there are light-coloured rocks that form themselves into sharp peaks and very explosive volcanoes Mount St Helens Krakatoa on the outside of the Line while there are dark-coloured rocks that give rise to rounded hills from which flow copious amounts of benign lavas Mauna Loa within it 
When the Line was adduced the science of plate tectonics was unknown the mechanics are better understood today and I shall return to them later  For now the geologists ' definition is sufficient the tectonic Pacific is a body that is only about 70 per cent of the area of the conventionally accepted Ocean and omits the coasts of all the South American and most of the South-East-Asian countries 
This is a definition which while perhaps satisfying the intellectual appetites of a few myopic geophysicists and considerably more satisfying than that of the Pentagon still bears little relation to reality  Yet neither does what we might call the economists Pacific' 
This though is probably the most popular modern vision of the Pacific a vision of a place of unbridled growth vigour and wealth one that has helped to spawn modish concepts like the Pacific Rim the Pacific Basin and the Pacific Community each of which will be considered in detail later  But the Pacific which has led to such thinking is a very different place from that dreamed up by soldiers or geologists and once again is some way removed from the real warts-and-all Pacific to which later chapters will be devoted 
It is a collection of those countries which generally have two things in common they abut on to the ocean and they are in some positive always positive way economically or politically vibrant  Japan is a good example invariably on every list as is the other side of that particular economic equation the United States South Korea is always there too Taiwan invariably Hong Kong and Singapore usually the Philippines on occasion 
Some countries Australia Fiji New Guinea Mexico are included in some definitions omitted from others  And a whole host of other countries North Korea Chile the Solomon Islands Colombia hardly ever get counted by the practitioners of the dismal science despite their admirably Pacific qualities 
So a Pacific as defined by such minds might fall within the appropriate longitudes and latitudes but it would be riddled with holes a discontinuous mess a collection of unconnected pieces of sea and land established principally to prove an argument about an entity of which they make up only a fraction  The geographers and the oceanographers politically disinterested a corps d'elite as they are offer us two uncomplicated versions of the Pacific 
The first is what we might call the technical Pacific that immense body of water lying to the seaward of all the island arcs and groups within the Ocean 's obvious continental margins  It is in places almost congruent with the tectonic Pacific its outline follows the Andesite Line along the western margin of the Pacific plate from Kamchatka to Christchurch 
But on the eastern margin it keeps its own counsel instead of heading out to sea to follow the line of the Easter Island Ridge this Pacific Ocean boundary stretches with only three minor hiccups directly down the American coasts from Attu Island in the Aleutians to Diego Ramirez Island off Cape Horn  This is thus the most nearly recognizable of all the Pacifics we have considered so far 
However it is the next and last version which can most reasonably be regarded as the true Pacific  This uses the technically-defined Ocean as above except that all the hiccups that interrupt the passage of its boundary have been removed by the relatively simple process of granting to it all of the so-called marginal seas to which logic and political reality suggest it can lay claim 
The three hiccups on the American coast are the Gulf of Alaska the vast and confusing mess of nameless bays and inlets and fiords between Skagway and Vancouver and the Gulf of California  Excluded from the technical Pacific these are now part of the real Pacific 
Would that the other coasts were so simple  To perform the same task on the other side of the world the following eleven major seas all on the continental side of the Andesite Line all secure on their own tectonic plates need to be included we are proceeding northwards and clockwise from a point somewhere south of New Zealand the Tasman Solomon Coral Bismarck Philippine South China East China and Yellow Seas the Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea 
There are lesser seas which must also be included in particular the fifteen around the islands of the East Indian archipelago the Sulu Celebes and Molucca Seas the Gulf of Tomini the Halmahera Ceram Banda Arafura which may or may not contain the Gulf of Carpentaria depending on which atlas is used Timor and Flores Seas the Gulf of Boni the Bali Sea the Makassar Strait the Java and Savu Seas and there is the Gulf of Thailand the Strait of Malacca the Singapore Strait and the Inland Sea of Japan  Add to this the Great Australian Bight and the Bass Strait for if we did not it would be difficult to regard Australia as a Pacific nation which would indeed be a foolish error and we have arrived at what seems the most appropriate and comprehensive definition of our goal one oceanic bloc twenty-four marginal Seas of which one is designated Inland five Gulfs four Straits one Canadian Confusion and one Australian Bight 
All told that is some 69,370,000 square miles and 173,700,000 cubic miles of sea though the Scottish mapmakers Bartholomew omit all the waters south of Australia as well as the Timor and the Savu Seas and come up with a total of 67 million square miles  Whatever the precise total it is through these waters found north and south of the 13,235 uninterrupted miles separating Malaysia from Colombia and east and west of the 9,600 miles lying between Big Diomede Island in the Bering Strait and the Cape Adare in Antarctica that the axis of the world some would have us believe is now turning 
The Ocean thus defined is almost immeasurably vast its size only imaginable in terms of other immensities  Its area takes up fully one third of the entire earth 's surface it makes up half of the World Ocean 
Twice as large as the Atlantic and getting on for three times the size of the Indian Ocean it is bigger than all the land surface of the earth including Antarctica and with Africa counted twice  It has the deepest sea known 36,200 feet nearly seven miles 
Not unexpectedly perhaps it contains that spot on the world 's surface that is most distant from land where the longitude 118Â° 30'W intersects 47Â° 30 'S is an equal 1,560 miles from the nearest coasts of Chile peter Island in Antarctica and an uninhabited British colonial possession a member of the Pitcairn group called Ducie Island  Moreover it is as so vastly important a body of water perhaps should be the original ocean of the world the so-called Panthalassa 
If one accepts and not everyone does there are some vocal Soviet opponents of the idea the theory of continental drift propounded by Alfred Wegener then the present configuration of the planet derives from the break-up of a single super-continent which he called Pangea which comprised two lesser continents called Gondwanaland and Laurasia and a shallow marginal sea named the Tethys  Some then inexplicable process forced the supercontinents to break into immense component pads which became in the case of Gondwanaland Africa South America India Antarctica and Australia and in the case of Laurasia North America Europe and continental Asia 
The slow fission of Gondwanaland produced two oceans the Indian where Africa India and Antarctica were hauled away from each other and the southern portion of the Atlantic where South America and its clearly closely-fitting neighbour Africa which possessed an uncanny coastal match first noted by Francis Bacon sprang apart  Laurasia 's similar explosion gave rise to the North Atlantic and the Tethys was widened to produce the Mediterranean and all the other shallow seas that decorate the central parts of Asia and southern Russia 
But Panthalassa as Wegener called it had already been born  The events that he suggested his theory fell out of favour in the Twenties and has only been revived since the study of palaeomagnetism indicated the strong likelihood that the continents had drifted and in continuous directions at regular velocities were supposed to have started to take place 600 million years ago 
The Panthalassic sea that supposedly surrounded the proto-continents is thus at least that old  Australia drifted up and into it and is still drifting northwards at an infinitesimal rate but very little else 
The immense landless mass of Pacific water is more or less as it always has been  Its size and its stability have come about largely because unlike the other oceans the Pacific is made essentially of one tectonic plate one of the eight plates that cover the surface of the earth 
Plate tectonics appears to be the device unexplained in Wegener 's day that permits the continents to drift it is a process whereby the rigid relatively cool plates that cover the earth 's hot and partially plastic asthenosphere forty miles down shift slowly about colliding and separating from the other plates by turn  The processes that occur when these plates meet is now thought to form the basis of all the planet 's tectonic processes from the formation of continents and mountain chains to the making of ocean deeps island arcs volcanoes and earthquakes 
The structure of the Pacific its enormous landless centre its contorted and congested peripheries is due entirely to the plates of which it is constructed and the manner in which they have moved in relation to each other  I have mentioned that the Ocean 's enormity and stability derives from the dominant presence of one plate the Pacific Plate 
Probably the largest on the earth 's surface to me it bears a passing resemblance to a somewhat distorted version of a face that was popular in Eighties amusement arcades that belonging to a creature called Pac-Man  If it is possible to conjure up such an image then imagine the head facing to the left the west 
The top of the head the northern boundary of the plate runs from the Alaskan coast near Seward along the line of the Aleutian Islands to the Komandorsklye Islands off Kamchatka  The top of the face then runs along the Kuril Islands to Japan staying always on the ocean side of these chains down through the Marianas Saipan Guam Palau to a point just east of the Spice Islands which played so large a part in the saga of Magellan and his attempted circumnavigation 
Then Pac-Man 's mouth begins a jaw that turns inward eastward along the northern coast of New Guinea through New Britain the Solomons the Torres Islands the New Hebrides and New Caledonia  Next the upper jaw ends the lower begins the outline turning back south-westwards through Samoa Tonga and the Kermadec Islands to the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand where in a typical display of tectonic activity there was a major earthquake with considerable damage and injury in 1987 
The lower jawbone continues through both the North and South Islands of New Zealand until it reaches the chin then begins a slow doubling back along an unseen series of mid-oceanic ridges that curve through the roaming forties become the back of Pac-Man 's skull and turn back up towards warmer water surfacing briefly as Easter Island and the pinnacles of Sala y Gomez and joining the scalp and the hairline at the Mexican coast Baja California and the west coasts of America Canada and finally Alaska once more  This great plate adorned with a few hot spots where plumes of magma have spurted to the surface randomly to form such agglomerations of islands as the Hawaiian chain the Marquesas the Tuamotos the Tubuais and that tiny British possession the Pitcairn group is almost universally deep has a floor covered with siliceous oozes and red clays and is dotted with millions of volcanic abyssal hills discovered by the trailing of arrays of echo-sounders 
Most important though is the fact that the Pacific Plate is moving  It is floating propelled by convection currents deep in the mantle at between six and sixteen centimetres a year towards the north-west 
This movement which though tiny in real time is immense in the aeons of geological time is wholly responsible for the other dramatic features of the Pacific  For there are other plates surrounding the Pacific Plate and they jostle and crash against each other like ice floes at break-up time and as they jostle so they tide up against each other pushing each other deeper cracking and bending as they do so only on a global scale and with extraordinary consequences 
There are essentially two processes at work one to be seen at the western edge of the Pacific and the other towards the east  In the west the Pacific Plate meets two other major plates the Eurasian and the Indo-Australian 
The collision is slow mighty and spectacular  What is believed to happen and plate tectonics is still only a matter of intelligent conjecture not amenable to the kind of proof most sciences demand is that the Pacific Plate being composed of heavier oceanic rocks hits the Continental Plate and is forced down beneath it subducted and propelled hundreds of kilometres downwards towards the region of the mantle where it melts and becomes the stuff of volcanoes once again 
It takes a little of the Continental Plate with it producing a rare and exotic melt of rock and as it goes down and melts and as its volume changes and its physical chemistry alters so this deep-diving mess of ocean rock contorts and winces and deep-seated earthquakes and violent eruptions occur  The subduction takes place at an angle the Pacific Plate is being forced down but forced onwards too so the line of its descent is a gentle plane inclined at perhaps 30Â° 
The eruptions however occur directly above the point of strain in the asthenosphere where they happen meaning that a line of volcanoes and volcanic islands occurs to the landward side of the colliding plates  Between the islands and the edge of the two plates is one further feature a series of ultra-deep trenches in the sea-bed where the Pacific Plate is being forced down to meet its original maker 
The order then is always the same Pacific Plate trench volcanic island earthquake zone Continental Plate  And it is repeated time and again around the Ocean 's western margin 
Take for instance the North Pacific  As one progresses outward from the sea there is the classic order the Japan trench the Japanese Islands Fuji-san the great Kansei earthquake zone the Sea of Japan the Asian continent Siberia 
Or again further south in the true West Pacific the order once more the New Guinea trench New Guinea the volcanoes of Manam Kaul and Long Islands deep-seated earthquakes the stable continental mountain ranges of Central New Guinea the continent of Australia  The line of trenches indicates precisely where the Pacific subduction zone begins exactly where the Pacific Plate collides with its neighbours 
The Aleutian trench is thus where it hits the North American Plate the trenches of Kurlin Japan Bonin Mariana the deepest in the world with a hole of 36,201 feet Yap Palau and Manus indicate its collision with the Eurasian Plate the Mussau Solomon Vitiaz Torres and New Hebrides trenches show where the Pacific Plate overrides the subducted Indo-Australian Plate and the Tonga Kermadec Hikurangi Hjort Iselin and Balleny trenches demonstrate the effect of bumping into the same Indo Australian Plate and passing beneath it  And on the landward side of all the trenches except those between the Solomons and the New Hebrides where they are on the seaward side are the island chains Japan to New Zealand whose birth is in whole or in part a consequence of all that colliding and jostling beneath the blue horizons 
The reverse is happening in the eastern part of the Ocean  Here the Pacific Plate bowed stretched and strained by its westward movement is moving away from its neighbour in this case a relatively small fragment of lithosphere known as the Nazca plate 
And the very opposite processes obtain instead of cold rock being forced down hot rock springs up to fill the void between the two separating plates  A line of oozing volcanic vents a sharp steep ridge below the sea surface runs from San Diego via Easter Island south-westwards 
Along this line new ocean floor is being generated the material lost by being subducted into the mantle is being replaced by black coils of basalt easing their way out of cracks and fissures on the sea-bottom  This sea-floor spreading as the phenomenon is known is happening at an impressive rate near the Galapagos Islands the sea-floor is expanding at eight inches a year down by Easter Island by nine inches 
It is a process of oceanic generation and destruction generation in the middle destruction at the outer edges that is peculiar to the Pacific Ocean  The Atlantic though dominated by an enormous mid-ocean ridge where new sea-floor is being created at a modest rate of about an inch a year is home to only two very small subduction zones with volcanoes and trenches in the Caribbean and the South Sandwich Islands and therefore is not being destroyed at its edges as rapidly as it is being created in the middle the Indian Ocean is similarly undramatic a mid-ocean ridge once again but a single subduction zone where its eastern plate collides with the Eurasian Plate and produces the volcanoes that like Krakatoa line the southern side of the islands of Java Sumatra and Timor 
There is finally one other possible relationship that mobile plates can enjoy those which neither collide nor diverge may simply slip past each other rotating in relation to one another around some imagined pole  This is happening right now in the eastern Pacific the Pacific Plate is sliding north-westwards while the North American Plate is sliding south-eastwards and the two strain and rub as they do so 
Enormous tension can build up along the margin of the two plates and occasionally explodes into immense earthquakes which can if they strike inhabited portions of the land suffice wreak terrible damage  One such place where the two plates are edging past each other is at the San Andreas fault in Northern California the consequences of a major release of tension along that line are too well-known and too horrific to bear repeating here 
The earthquake of October 1989 reminded San Franciscans of the awesome power of the thing  In summary the Pacific is not simply the biggest and the deepest quarter of the world ocean 
It is the most active and most geologically interesting a test-bed an ever-mobile demonstration of all the major forces and processes that shape the great structures of the planet  Vulcanologists and headline-writers talk about the Ring of Fire the Halo of Energy that surrounds and encloses the Pacific there are 336 active volcanoes surrounding the Pacific as against a mere 94 in all the Atlantic and Indian Oceans 
The phrases have become metaphors some writers suggest for all the zest and excitement that drives the Pacific 's inhabitants ever onward  And they are indeed appropriate metaphors for this geophysically-speaking is where the planet 's action really is the axis of the earth 's creativity the centre of its growth 
The eponymous notion of Ferdinand Magellan 's men that the Mar del Sur was a Pacific sea blessed by fine weather and pleasant breezes was more or less coded at least for that region of the Ocean through which they first sailed and where their optimism was at its height  But elsewhere particularly to the west of the Date Line and north of the 40th parallel the Pacific can be anything but Pacific and may be as savagely destructive as any stretch of water known 
The general weather system of the Pacific is determined by the emptiness and uninterrupted smoothness of the Ocean of the area above which as all over the planet air pressures build and wind patterns develop  No vast islands with walls of rock or ice stand to disrupt the progress of the wind 
There are no sand deserts or snowfields or rain forests to lift or deflect the breezes or raise or lower the temperature  So the climate conforms almost totally to the east of the Date Line to what is called the planetary weather system the theoretical system of winds and pressures that would exist if the earth was a near-perfect spheroid unencumbered with continents mountain chains and other complicating nuisances 
Winds blow as they should in the directions that physics tells us they should at the right speed and in the proper season  The steadiness of the breezes is quite remarkable nowhere else on earth is the weather so stable 
Nor so perfect  In the region of the trades the south-easterlies between the equator and Capricorn and the north-easterlies to the north of the equator up to the Tropic of Cancer one can count on endless days and weeks of steady 13-knot winds a delightful lack of high humidity and temperature and skies that are either cloudless or decorated with small white patches of flat-bottomed cumulus cloud always poised a third of a mile above the sea 
It is perfect sailing weather a yacht can cast off from San Diego in January coast southwards before a good southerly blow and then catch the trades which will take her almost clear across to the Philippine Islands without the need for a single sail change  There will never be more than a stray shower the waves will never be more than three feet high with a scattering of white horses when the breeze runs into double figures 
No sailor who has ever crossed the tropical Pacific at the right season will forget the idyll of the passage  However the weather is very different to the west of a sinuous line that curves down from a point off the east coast of Japan and then very roughly parallels a thousand miles out the outline of Asia curving in towards Borneo out over New Guinea down around the Solomons 
The simplicity and pleasing symmetry of the trades is suddenly quite destroyed by the influence of the Asian land mass and its monsoonal seasonal climate  The immense summer heat of the Asian deserts the low pressures they generate above them the consequently varying winds all these features dominate the weather of the western Pacific and much more so in the northern hemisphere where the ocean is overshadowed by two immense land masses compared with the relatively landless margins south of the equator 
So in winter the trade winds are strengthened and diverted and are almost reversed in summer  Good south-westerly blows are dominant during the Asian summer cold north-easterlies during the winter 
The change from one monsoon to another can be sudden and dramatic  One February evening I was in a ship northbound through the South China Sea 
It was bitterly cold the chill wind roaring down from Siberia raising immense grey seas through which the ship plunged head-to in clouds of spume  The crew all looked liverish and unhappy 
But by next morning the gales had dropped though it was still very cold and the sea was glassy doldrum-like  Then by lunchtime a line of waxy yellow-white clouds was spotted abaft by the starboard lookout and before long a breath of hot and humid air was wafting over a ship which in a matter of moments since its metal was still so cold was dripping with condensation 
By nightfall the air was tropical the humidity was unbearable and every fan was on every punkah louvre open and every air conditioner roaring away  In no more than twenty hours and with 400 sea-miles beneath our keel the miserable Asian winter had given way to the equally miserable Asian summer and all newcomers on the ship knew full well what the monsoon was all about 
But however unpleasant monsoonal conditions can on occasion be they are as nothing compared with the fearsome storms that hurl themselves on the Pacific with terrible regularity  The Atlantic and the Indian Ocean receive their due share of tropical cyclonic storms too but in the Pacific because of its vastness they are visitations of destruction and tragedy like nowhere else in the world 
The storms have different names depending on where they are generated and where they hit  In the north-east Pacific they are known as hurricanes in the south-west as cyclones 
In a long stretch of vulnerable Asian land between Vietnam and Japan they are typhoons the Chinese words for big wind in the Philippines which suffer each summer from the most dreadful storms they are baguios on the west costs of Mexico and Central America cordonazos and in north-western Australia willy-willies  Officially in the neutral world of the meteorologists they are known as tropical revolving storms the most energetic and destructive of all the planet 's natural surface phenomena 
The storms seem to be formed in the strangely disturbed band of atmosphere that lies athwart the equator between the two trade wind regions and is known as the intertropical convergence zone  How and why they form is still not known all that can be said with certainty is that winds begin to twirl anti-clockwise around a fixed point of steadily diminishing atmospheric pressure and this circulating system then begins to move invariably in a westerly direction its internal pressure steadily falling and the gales inside it picking up speed as it does so 
By the time the storm is fully formed it may be as much as 400 miles wide moving at perhaps 20 miles an hour and with winds near its core raging at well over 100 miles an hour  If this beast then hits land there can be destruction on a titanic scale floods ruined houses uprooted trees broken bridges the ruin of crops and the death of livestock and loss of human life 
In the less well-developed countries where warnings of impending storms are poor and precautions minimal whole tracts of countryside can be inundated entire villages swept away vast communities decimated  India suffers terribly the Philippines too and the low-lying Parts of eastern China 
In Hong Kong where there is a well-oiled storm warning machine piloted by the staff of the ancient Royal Observatory the entire community becomes rather gaily caught up in the summertime ritual of typhoon watch  Idle or perhaps not so idle mention may be made on the radio news of a distant tropical depression known to be forming somewhere close to an exotic and encouragingly far away island Yap maybe or Truk or the northern Matianas 
The colony pricks up its ears  The circulating system wanders a little closer deepens is classified under a new title a moderate tropical storm and is given a name Agnes perhaps or Bob an innocent unassuming rather cosy old-fashioned sort of name that makes no connection in anybody 's mind with a swirling mass of warm air and piled clouds that is bearing down on the coast thunder and lightning flickering from its belly the waves beneath it being whipped up into a fury 
Across in Hong Kong the marine department raises a single beacon on a flagpole on Green Island the No. 1 signal all Hong Kong is now formally aware that a typhoon may be forming within 500 miles  Next day Agnes if that is what the storm is called keeps to a westerly track hurrying a little more deepening a little more 
Now it has been upgraded still further to a severe tropical storm winds at the centre measured by radar and by American air force planes despatched from the big bases in Japan and the Philippines are gusting to eighty miles an hour  Shipping is advised to keep well clear and masters begin to make the complicated storm-avoidance manoeuvres well known to those familiar with these waters in this summer season 
In Hong Kong the No. 3 warning is hoisted a little coloured blip appears at the bottom left of the colony 's television screens a constant reminder that a typhoon alert may soon be declared and the emergency drills so well practised in the territory brought into force  And already the thin strands of cloud the outer rings of the immense whirling storm begin to drift over the southern islands Po Toi Sung Kong Waglan Island the Ninepins and the wind and the waves begin to bustle about in the harbours 
The junks start to roll heavily in the swell  Fishermen on the distant banks beat for home 
The old sampan-ladies begin to tie up their wares wrapping everything in layers of black plastic and hessian sacking  The typhoon shelters at Aberdeen and Mong Kok start to fill with craft their prudent masters and owners looking uneasily at the eastern sky as it blackens and darkens and as the wind begins to sing in the telephone wires the unsecured edges of roofs begin to flap and creak and the streets are busy with flying litter and dust 
And then shortly before noon next day the Observatory announces that Typhoon Agnes will strike Hong Kong head on imminently  The No. 8 signal is raised and the colony goes into its well-known emergency rituals 
Schools empty  Shops shut down 
All businesses factories financial markets the airports everything are declared closed  The entire colony scurries home 
The Star Ferry keeps on going its little green ships bucking across the harbour in the growing swell until the last stragglers from Kowloon have made it to Hong Kong and those bound north from the island have reached their goal  And then for ten twenty forty hours or so the millions sit back to watch the show as the huge tropical storm lashes and bursts and howls its way around the islands shaking shuddering and drenching the place as if it held all the concentrated fury of nature and had decided to unleash it upon this one unfortunate spot 
To go out in a Hong Kong typhoon is to experience an almost pleasurable madness  The banshee-like wail of the wind is majestic 
It is almost impossible to stand up and you haul yourself from building to building from stanchion to stanchion as if on board a ship rounding the Horn in a nor'wester  The air is dangerously alive with the objects pieces of tin small stones branches tiles being hurled along by the wind 
The horizontal rain stings like grazing bullets  You only venture outside once 
Most people who have been seasoned by these violent irruptions stay indoors where they hold typhoon parties or watch the progress of the storm on the television  On every channel earnest-looking men with maps and pointers looking like war-gamers in some fiendish Pentagon basement demonstrate predict even the inch-by-inch path that the storm is taking noting that it usually passes off to the north but may perhaps curve back upon itself and go in for a second strike 
But then with a final burst of rain and a final howl of the gale it is all over the only cyclonic visitation of the year perhaps  The storm signals are reduced in urgency from No. 8 to 3 to 1 and then the last is taken away 
The dead and injured and often there are casualties particularly in the poorer areas or the more remote parts of the New Territories countryside are taken away the power lines and landslips are repaired the beached ships are tugged off the reefs the cost is counted and the colonials take to watching with a curious mixture of pride and nostalgia as the storm our Agnes they 'll call it wanders away does some more smashing and battering in Taiwan or the Yangtze valley before petering out quite spent and becomes just another statistic for the record books  The truly mighty storms are remembered for years though the frequency of destructive typhoons is depressingly high in some corners of the Pacific the Philippines for instance and Japan 
In 1979 alone for instance devastating storms named Cecil Irving Mac Sarah and Vera struck the Philippines three in Luzon one in Leyte one off Samar  In one storm 46 inches of rain fell in 24 hours 
And unlike Hong Kong the Philippines is ill prepared for floods high winds and landslips and there is invariably much loss of life generally ignored by the rest of the uninterested world  There is one final and decidedly non-Pacific phenomenon that occurs only in this ocean the tsunami 
This tidal wave is a product of the combined efforts of the jostling of the crustal plates and the behaviour of the deep Ocean through which the resulting shock waves are transmitted a small nudge in southern Chile can set up a wave that streaks across the entire Pacific in a matter of hours with unimaginably enormous force  In deep water the travelling wave may be only a few feet high but on those rare occasions when such waves reach shallow water or coastlines they can rear up and explode with fearful consequences 
The infamous Chilean case in May 1960 began with an earthquake deep in the subduction zone between the Nazca and the South American Plates scores of people died near the town of Puerto Montt  But it was the resulting tsunami that did the greater damage it lumbered away to the north-west speeding up and gathering energy as it did so 
It hit Hawaii fifteen hours later wrecking boats and beaches ruining the Waikiki tourist trade and twenty-four hours after being triggered in southern Chile it hit Japan 10,000 miles north  When it hit it was travelling at more than 400 miles an hour no one expected it and hundreds of Japanese living along the coasts of Hokkaido and Honshu were drowned 
Warning stations were then established all over the Ocean and a big tsunami early warning system was set up in Hawaii an island chain through which all major long-haul waves it is reckoned were bound to pass  The almost ceaseless trade winds of the central Pacific propel the Ocean 's surface waters westward on both sides of the equator forming the basis of the two enormous but essentially very simple circulatory systems of currents that dominate the Ocean 
The two equatorial currents interleaved by the equatorial counter-current take waters from the American coast across to New Guinea and Mindanao then one heads north taking warm water to the Japanese coast as the Kuro Shio  This warm water collides at around 36Â°N with the southbound cold Oya Shio part of the small anti-clockwise current system in the Bering Sea causing huge and navigationally hazardous fog banks to form four days out of ten 
The main north Pacific current system continues in a clockwise direction the mixed cooling waters of the Bering Sea and the Kuro current turning east and then when they reach the coast in the region of Seattle turning south to form the cold California current source of all the San Francisco fogs and a challenge for the more courageous of Oregon sea-swimmers  Much the same takes place though in mirror-image in the south Pacific 
The southern equatorial current is diverted south past the Solomon Islands and goes on to bathe the Great Barrier Reef and indeed much of the Australian coastline down past Sydney in the tropical water of the east Australian current  It then turns east joining the endless eastern drift of the southern Ocean current before heading back up north once again along the coast of Chile and Peru as the Peru current 
Although there is no South Pacific equivalent of the foggy collision of the Kuro Shio and the Oya Shio there is one crucially important peculiarity about the currents off the South American coast which has a bearing on the economic livelihood of tens of thousands of people  It is associated with a phenomenon known somewhat inelegantly as upwelling 
Upwelling occurs when offshore winds like in this case the south-easterly trades persistently drive water away from the land and the sea replaces that water by allowing cold bottom water to well up from below  The effect off the coast of Ecuador is twofold first the waters off the Ecuadorian coast a few degrees north and south of the equator are unusually cold indeed so powerful is the upwelling that a belt of this oddly cold water extends west from Ecuador for nearly 3,000 miles 
The second and economically important consequence is that the new water from the ocean bottom is dense with phosphate nitrates and many other nutrients liked by planktonic life with the result that this belt of water is stiff with plankton  The food chain being what it is these same waters are alive with fish and the skies and islands are dense with birds 
Fishermen scurry all over the seas catching anchovies quarrymen have long made a living scraping guano from the bird-rich islands  All told the upwelling of the cold waters of the south-eastern Pacific has long been a source of considerable economic importance 
But occasionally and for reason not quite understood the upwelling suddenly stops  The trade winds weaken the waters off the Ecuadorian coast are not pushed relentlessly out to sea there is no consequent need for any replenishment 
In addition the lack of upwelling allows a tongue of the equatorial counter-current which normally passes into and flails pointlessly about in the Gulf of Panama to head further south into the region of the northbound Peru current  In the years when this inexplicable phenomenon occurs and it usually happens around Christmas and so is known by the local fishermen as El NiÃ±o the plankton suddenly vanish the fish die and the birds fly away or are left to starve and rot 
The fishermen come back with their holds empty the islands have neither birds nor guano it is said that the strength of the smell of the gases from the millions of tons of decaying fish is such that it can blacken the hull of a passing ship a phenomenon known as the Callao Painter  The gallows humour disguises the very real misery that El NiÃ±o causes not only are there no fish to harvest but the arrival of the rogue current reaching down all those unfamiliar and unwelcome degrees of latitude invariably causes heavy rains soil erosion landslips and added misery to the towns along the Peruvian and Ecuadorian coast 
During the last ninety years El NiÃ±o one of the Pacific Ocean 's more enigmatic problems has occurred nine times in 1891 1925 1941 1953 1958 1965 1973 1976 and 1983  The mechanisms of the upper atmosphere and the deep sea that cause it to spoil so many Larin Christmas times are still unknown but there is beguiling evidence that whenever El Nin-o appears in the Pacific so the monsoon rains in India are perilously sparse the winters in the continental USA are unusually harsh and there is a further episode of drought in that wretched quarter of Africa known as the Sahel 
Further study is necessarily being completed but the evidence of linkage between the simultaneous appearance of climatic phenomena in Kansas Chad Bihar and in the south eastern Pacific Ocean suggests what all geographers have known for many years that the globe works as one complete system one vast interactive machine and that the divisions man has forced upon it are no more than crudely artificial devices for our own intellectual convenience  The resources presently known to exist on or beneath the land surface of the Pacific are stupendous in their extent and importance 
There are few diamonds to be found nor is there much cocoa and considering the amount of space the Pacific commands it might seem a little odd unless one remembers the geology that only a fifth of the world 's proven oil reserves are there  Most of those lie off the minute sheikdom of Brunei and are the personal property of the Sultan who is in consequence the world 's richest man 
Brunei is also the world 's wealthiest country with a GNP per inhabitant of $21,000 half as much again as that of the United States  But just about everything else exists and in spades 
There is more than half the world 's coal much of it in Manchuria half the world 's uranium much of it in Australia half the world 's natural gas nine-tenths of the silk 67 per cent of the cotton 63 per cent of the wool huge iron mines great deposits of silver and it has lately been found a girdle of epithermal gold lodged in the volcanic rocks from the Solomon Islands to northern Japan  Lihir Island off the west coast of New Ireland itself sitting off the north coast of Papua New Guinea is said to have the world 's largest gold deposit though as it sits inside a volcano the deeper the miners dig the hotter they get 
In terms of similarly world-beating deposits there is nickel in New Caledonia the mining establishment once ruled the island in the name of France aluminium at Weipa on the Cape York peninsula of Queensland iron in the Hamersley Range of Western Australia lead zinc and silver at Broken Hill uranium near Darwin and in the tiny Queensland town called Mary Kathleen copper and lead at Mount Isa whose smokestack is the tallest structure in northern Australia  Malaysia has the world 's biggest tin deposits while the South Jianxi and Guangdong provinces of China are rumoured to have the most tungsten 
The Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea seeks to reduce to ground zero a massive mountain of copper capped with a summit of gold  There is yet more tungsten in the Yukon vast deposits of copper and molybdenum in Arizona still more copper and molybdenum in both northern and central Chile 
And dotted in mines and quarries from New Zealand clockwise around to Easter Island the ocean is littered with cobalt zirconium titanium antimony and almost everything else under the sun  And with almost every mineral so also every kind of food and crop 
There is rice in abundance of course China Japan Indonesia Thailand Burma Vietnam and Korea produce and then consume most of the world 's annual crop of 400 million tons of the grain of Oryza sativa  Of the centres of the world 's rice culture only India and Bangladesh lie outside the region we have defined as the Pacific 
Most of the world 's beef mutton pork fish eggs wheat wool cotton sugar groundnuts palm oil soyabeans bananas tea oranges and pineapples come from Pacific countries only wine potatoes apples cocoa and milk come predominantly from countries beyond the Pacific pale  However the distribution of all this food is patchy 
There is still real malnutrition to be found in islands of the Philippine archipelago  I have seen children with the classic symptoms of kwashiorkor distended bellies and rheumy eyes sitting aimlessly in dingy hospitals outside silent sugar mills on Negros Island and wondered how such tropic abundance could possibly spawn such misfortune 
Nutritionists and cartographers still draw the so-called hunger line through Asia and the Americas the poorer people who live in those countries that are sandwiched between Mexico and Chile and between North Korea and New Guinea exist on diets of fewer than 2,250 calories a day and thus go to bed each night hungry  And herein of course lies one of the ruder ironies of the Pacific that among all this economic vibrancy and dynamism there are still the familiar evils we currently associate only with Africa or with countries that are at war illiteracy hunger a vertiginous growth of population disease overcrowding slums 
Beside the glitter of all the Pacific wealth there are still pockets becoming ever smaller the governments and their statisticians insist where the unhappiness and squalor of the inhabitants remain an insult a disfiguring blot on the Ocean 's otherwise gleaming escutcheon  As their national borders are currently defined and as this book has decided to define the Pacific thirty-three countries lie around the margins of the Ocean 
Twenty-three more lie within it  They can be grouped more or less efficiently according' to the usual geographical rules 
The peripheral Pacific for instance can be divided into six  Australia and New Zealand originally settled by white Europeans and still following a generally Protestant tradition are usually regarded together though it is worth noting that if their native aborigines and Maoris still dominated their populations both countries would be regarded as South-East Asian joined ethnically and culturally across the Arafura Sea 
But in fact the Sea does divide this new Antipodean culture from the ancient traditions of South-East Asia and so renders the countries separate and distinct from their neighbours  The South-East Asian Pacific nations comprise among others the world 's largest Islamic country Indonesia the only Asian Christian country the Philippines the world 's richest country Brunei what is probably the world 's poorest country Kampuchea the busiest port-city Singapore as well as Thailand Malaysia Laos Vietnam and Papua New Guinea 
The Gulf of Tonkin and the Vietnamese frontier is the arbitrary point at which South-East gives way to North-East Asia the industrial powerhouse of the Pacific the region that most economists and businessmen mean when they idly refer these days to Asia  In terms of its population China dominates of course but there is also the old Portuguese colony of Macau the thoroughly modern British colony though soon to be retroceded of Hong Kong the Republic of China on Formosa now known as Taiwan Japan the two implacably hostile Koreas North and South and the Soviet Union 
The range of ideologies climates ethnic varieties economic standing and futures apparent in this spread between the islands of Hainan and Sakhalin invariably defies imagination  And then the Date Line is passed and we are into a segment of the Pacific best known for its unrivalled prosperity and good fortune here is the United States sharing with Japan the suzerain 's role and sandwiched between its two continental divisions the Dominion of Canada 
Next pushing further south we enter what seems to be a perpetually troubled and impoverished region between Tijuana and the DariÃ©n Gap Mexico distinguished in global terms these days solely by being the site of the planet 's largest city and a succession of Isthmian countries  We tend to think of most Central American countries as somehow linked by the Caribbean Sea to the Caribbean islands and cultures but all the republics have Pacific coastlines and so Guatemala El Salvador Honduras with a scant 45 miles of Pacific shoreline along the Gulf of Fonseca Nicaragua Costa Rica and of course Panama can rightly if pedantically be thought of as Pacific nations 
Finally the sixth Pacific segment contains those countries that until lately have been utterly excluded from consideration those of South America  Colombia it is true still seems to regard herself as an Atlantic nation her trade goes principally through the Caribbean port of Cartagena rather than through the dire and crime-ridden wharves of the Pacific port of Buenaventura but Ecuador which has island possessions in the Ocean and Peru seem to be becoming further and further entwined in Pacific matters and Chile ah Chile 
She the bootlace of Latin America has the longest coastline of any country on the Pacific 3,317 miles longer by far than the entire Pacific coastline of Australia which is a mere 2,450 miles from Cape York to Tasmania  Although she is very much a latecomer Chile is now furiously building her Pacific interests and ambitions 
The links she is forming trade with China and Korea New Zealand and Australia are deliberately aimed at ensuring that Chile in particular and South America in general is becoming very much a legitimate partner in the Pacific of the future no matter that the local cultures and traditions -combined with the sheer distance from the Pacific 's economic heartland have always hitherto militated against the continent 's inclusion  Within this great encircling babel of tongues and cultures aspirations and rivalries lie the Pacific islands regarded from afar as idyllic and palm-fringed and all more or less the same 
But they are not at all the same being invariably grouped into three Polynesia Melanesia and Micronesia on the basis of complicated formulae relating to the race of the islanders their languages and their geography  But in contrast to the sturdy independence of the encircling nations many of the island-groups within have still to shake off the mastery of foreign powers and remain in subjugation 
European colonizers have left their marks all over the central Pacific in the name of protecting sea-lanes submarine cable routes or the native peoples themselves  These marks have proved almost indelible 
For although the tide of imperialism has ebbed considerably in most of the remainder of the world some of the Pacific islands are still too small and their governments too feeble to stand alone as independent states  The consequence and most would regard it as regrettable is that old empires or their sub-imperial nominees look after them even now 
Not one of the three island groups escapes  In Polynesia the largest of the groups an immense tilted isosceles triangle of islands with its apex in New Zealand and its other angles in Hawaii and Easter Island respectively only Western Samoa Tuvalu and Tonga are now nominally independent 
France has huge possessions the Tahiti group the Marquesas the Tubuais and the Tuamotus as well as those of Wallis and Futuna well to the west  The New Zealand government looks after the Cook Islands Niue and Tokelau the Americans have Samoa and the British look after the four islands of the Pitcairn group selling stamps for the islanders to help them keep up their revenues 
The Melanesian group stretching in a broken line to the east of the immense and mountainous island of Papua New Guinea includes the Solomons Vanuatu and Fiji each an independent free-standing state but the Australians look after Norfolk Island and there are French possessions too in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands with gendarmes soldiers from Lyons and Marseilles and offices of that wondrously-named bureaucracy the DOM-TOM which concerns itself with the DÃ©artements Outres-Mer et Territoires Outres-Mer  And finally the Micronesians up in the northwest of the ocean here Kiribati and Nauru are independent Guam is a self-governing American territory and the others Yap Ponape Truk Kosrae the Marshall Islands and Palau are part of the old post-war US Trust Territory now doing their best to keep afloat 
It would be idle to pretend that any of the Pacific islands have the kind of economic importance possessed by say Korea or Malaysia but in addition to potentially immense political importance and no small amount of charm they have a symbolic significance for they are what the world still thinks of when confronted with the single word Pacific  The countries of the Pacific are now inhabited by half the world 's people 2,400 million of them 
The figure is slightly spurious though  Some countries New Zealand say and Japan are obviously wholly Pacific but Australia the United States and Canada are shared by the two oceans that lap their eastern and western shores and Russia at least in the years prior to the Gorbachev speech at Vladivostok was a country whose traditions and ethnic roots were quite obviously Atlantic and Baltic 
To count the Soviet Union 's 275 millions as Pacific people is stretching the point a little and it might be more appropriate to count only those living east of the Urals  Similarly it might be proper to consider as Pacific only those Americans who live west of De Soto Missouri the median point of the population moving slowly ever-westward as the people do the same or in Australia those east of Alice Springs 
But the complication of such an operation would be considerable and it is reasonable to say that the entire population of the Pacific nations even if they inhabit the Atlantic seaboard can make use of the goods that are carried across the Pacific Ocean  So while noting that single caveat the figure of 2,400 million can be allowed to stand 
Half the world 's people like one third of her surface area is by this reckoning Pacific  These Pacific peoples speak I 200 of the world 's languages 
Most of them in number if not necessarily in influence speak Mandarin Chinese  A sizeable proportion the Americans Canadians Australians New Zealanders have as their first language the most supranational of all tongues English 
And an even more sizeable fraction nearly all Filipinos for instance have English as a back-up  Those living between Tijuana and Puerto Williams speak Spanish 
Some languages are peculiar to one region yet intimately related to others beyond like the 500 or so Austronesian tongues which not only link speakers in Vietnam and Cambodia with those in Fiji Malaysia the Philippines Sulawesi and Borneo but also reach out to the inland mountains of Taiwan the North Island of New Zealand and to the speakers of Dobu in the d'Entrecasteaux islands and of Trukese on Truk  There are important languages only spoken in their countries of origin Japanese for instance and Korean some Pacific languages unrelated to each other or to any other linguistic group on earth Ainu for example which is not spoken outside Hokkaido Island in Japan and has no relationship at all to Japanese and Gilyak which is used only by a very few people on Sakhalin Island a place known only as being the birthplace of the actor Yul Brynner and near where the Korean airliner KE 007 was shot down in 1983 
Superimposed upon this immense bewilderment is an equally confused gallimaufry of religions  The Marind of New Guinea believe that fire has its origins in sex and so indulge in a rite whereby a girl has to be raped in order to keep that fire alight 
Some Melanesians worship the memory of President Lyndon Johnson  Trobriand islanders use the tug-of-war cricket the collection of yams and great and freely expressed sexual enthusiasm as the planks of their complicated beliefs 
Anyone in Hong Kong with a problem be it so trivial as to know which horse to place a bet on or so crucial as to know whom to marry can ask the god Won Tai Sin whose temple is to be found in the middle of a vast housing estate in north Kowloon and who came to fame by turning boulders into sheep  Queensland aborigines believe they can sing a man to death and indeed recently managed to sing the state 's premier a white man a New Zealand migrant who cared little for black fellows out of office 
Every Easter a number of brave Filipino men allow themselves to be crucified with real nails driven through their palms in an attestation of their faith  Basically though the line of 150Â°W longitude divides the Pacific into the religious groups that really matter in terms of the Ocean 's success 
To the east of that line the dominant religions belong to the Christian-Hebraic schools to its west the societies have their roots in Confucian-Buddhist beliefs  To the east are Roman Catholicism and Protestantism Mormonism and Judaism Jimmy Swaggart Billy Graham and Oral Roberts 
To the west are Mahayana Buddhism Shinto Taoism and in a strangely aberrant appearance the Islam of Indonesia and even more odd Hinduism on the island of Bali  Above all though only formally practised by large numbers of zealots in South Korea is Confucianism a philosophical system now 2,500 years old but which underpins the entire belief system of almost everyone who whether under communist rule or not lives between the Yalu River and Cape York 
And as the Canadian writer Eric Downton put it in 1986 societies with Confucian-Buddhist roots are proving more effective in coping with the industrial and technological challenges on the eve of the twenty-first century than are those countries with a predominantly Christian-Hebraic heritage  Confucianism in other words is central to the coming triumph of the region we shall examine it in more detail later and perhaps will come to recognize its new strength its new status on the world 's political and economic stage 
For the teachings of the Sage suddenly have established themselves as an almost indestructible Oriental adhesive helping to bind so many of the region 's member-societies together  The Pacific as is surely now evident is an Ocean which while long trying to assume some kind of unity is plagued by a grossly inconvenient diversity 
It is after all an entity which gives house room to people as different as Chilean gaucho and Japanese silk farmer Californian software writer and Australian brewer Tongan noble and Panamanian politician it encompasses men and ideas more disparate and discordant than any to be found within the borders of any other physical entity on the planet  But now listeners insist some distant harmonies are being heard 
Some trans-Pacific resonances are being detected some symmetries noticed there is some recognition of a sense of common purpose and design  A few Atlanticists as one might term the doubters decline to recognize or admit that such things exist 
But to those for whom such patterns are becoming real and for whom some rational explanation of the shift is required then it can fairly be argued that the spreading ethic of Confucianism exported in the last hundred years or so to every nation on and within the Pacific coastline by the tens of millions of overseas Chinese who have acted as its accidental evangelists is crucial  It can be argued that it has played a significant one might even say the most significant role in producing all those patterns and distant harmonies that are being recognized as signalling the onset of the Pacific Age 
Towards the eastern end of the Republic of Panama a few hundred yards away from a tiny DariÃ©n settlement known as Santa FÃ© is a small somewhat dilapidated hut roofed against the rains with sheets of rusting corrugated iron  It is currently home to a family of Choco Indians their head a middle-aged farmer known by the local people as William 
Not Guillermo as might be expected in a Spanish-speaking community but William pur et simple  William 's life like that of nearly everyone else in Santa Fe appears to be both blameless and obscure and is occupied principally with the farming of bananas and taro plants on the shallow hillsides that slope down to a sluggish tributary of the Rio Sabanas 
He has lived in his rickety hut for most of his fifty years  His parents lived there once and generations before them on this patch of land if not in this particular accommodation 
But now the earlier generations have all passed on and today William 's home is crowded with his wife several small children an assortment of chickens and a gaggle of small excitable black pigs  In short it is very much the kind of hut in very much the kind of village with which DariÃ©n is amply overstocked 
Neither the village nor the house nor William is at all remarkable in any obvious way  Except that in one rather less than obvious way William is very special indeed 
There was one aspect of his life which had made him so of which I had heard talk long before on some obscure wanderers ' grapevine  Via the half-reliable morsels of intelligence that pass from continent to continent along this jungle-drummed smoke-signalled messageway it appeared that William the Choco of Santa FÃ© in DariÃ©n was possessed of an unusual link with a great historical moment 
He had insisted so the story went that he knew and his knowledge was said to be based on information handed down from Choco ancestors long dead but unforgotten what no one else in Panama knew or apparently wanted to and no one in the world of historical scholarship knew either  This small shard of antiquarian knowledge which he claimed was the precise location of the hill the peak in DariÃ©n from which Vasco NÃºÃ±ez de Balboa was reputed to have first glimpsed the Pacific Ocean on the morning of Tuesday 27 September 1513 
William it was rumoured could lead a man to the very spot where the Pacific Ocean was first seen by the first European explorer a place in space and time that changed the historical progress of the world  The story might or might not have been apocryphal 
William may or may not have been a rogue and charlatan there are said to be many such in Panama which as a crossroads for the modern world radiates a special magnetism for crews of ne'er-do-wells  But I had been sufficiently intrigued by the stories I had heard of William to want to find out 
Accordingly one winter 's day when I was at a suitable jumping-off place in America I decided to see if I could find him  I had the somewhat faint hope that he might lead me to the place and permit me to stand where Balboa had stood on the very peak which John Keats with the kind of monumental mistakenness permitted under the principle of poetic licence declared was occupied by 
stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific and all his men Looked at each other with wild surmise Silent upon a peak in DariÃ©n  stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific and all his men Looked at each other with wild surmise Silent upon a peak in DariÃ©n 
I went to Miami and booked myself aboard a late-night Pan American jumbo jet to Panama City arriving shortly before dawn in the pullulating and insufferably hot shanty-capital sprawling beside that most famous of all entrances to the world 's greatest of seas  When Panama City awakened and after I had taken a small breakfast of pineapple cafÃ© con leche and a hard roll or two I rented a small white Japanese car acquired a map from the official cartographers who conduct their business under the curious name of the Instituto Geografico Nacional Tommy Guardia and set out to look for Santa FÃ© for William and for the Pacific 
I was thus occupied by precisely the same ambition which had driven Vasco NÃºÃ±ez four and a half centuries before  Like him I knew that this great and peaceful ocean was out there somewhere 
I just wanted to lay my eyes upon it  I too wanted to stand silent or otherwise upon that peak in DariÃ©n 
It was in December 1511 that the King of Spain had given Balboa the job of Captain-General of the fledgling colony of DariÃ©n  The post was offered as somewhat grudging recognition that he had been a signal success as leader of the first European colony in South America a village called Santa Maria de la Antigua on the Atlantic coast of the Isthmus 
His success led to some intimacy with the Indians who told him that a vast sea lay off to the west a sea and a land infinitely rich in gold  Peter Martyr d'Anghiera the Italian court historian though to the Spanish court who was the inventor of the phrase the New World the man who first announced the existence of a substance called India-rubber and the principal contemporary chronicler of Columbus and all those others who explored and travelled to the Orbe Novo in the fifteenth century wrote an extraordinary account of how Balboa first heard the definite news 
It seems that during a period of good relations between the Spaniards and the native Indians the cacique of one local tribe had become blood-brother to Balboa and had actually persuaded the Spaniard to help him prosecute a local war  Quite conceivably the conquistadores like most colonial conquerors believed in policies of divide-and-rule of which this small conflict was but one example 
Whatever once the battles were over and the cacique 's tribe had won the man made Balboa a gift a quantity of gold ornaments so gaudy and so valuable that squabbling broke out among the Spaniards as to who should have which piece how much the minor colonial leaders should get how much Balboa himself should receive  Suddenly the cacique 's son who had watched the scene in dismayed silence lost his temper 
Richard Eden who translated Peter Martyr 's works quotes the young Indian as shouting to the Spaniards  What is the matter you Christian men that you so greatly esteeme so little portion of golde more than your own quietnesse 
If your hunger of gold bee so insatiable that onely for the desire you have thereto you disquiet so many nations  I will shew you a region flowing with golde where you may satisfy your ravening appetites 
When you are passing over these mountains poynting with his finger towarde the south mountaines you shall see another sea where they sayle with ships as bigge as yours using both sayles and ores as you doe although they men be naked as wee are  Balboa as avaricious arrogant and adventurous as any of his brother conquistadores decided in an instant that he must go and see for himself 
He sent news home to Spain demanding reinforcements of 1,000 men the number the cacique had warned him would be required to defeat such forces of hostile Indians along the way  Official Spain was immediately excited 
A force was raised an expedition was organized but Balboa it was ordered should not be its commander that task should go to a bitter rival Pedro Arias DÃ¡vila  The Pedrarias expedition as it is generally called today left Spain with 2,000 men in April 1514 
What is the matter you Christian men that you so greatly esteeme so little portion of golde more than your own quietnesse  If your hunger of gold bee so insatiable that onely for the desire you have thereto you disquiet so many nations 
I will shew you a region flowing with golde where you may satisfy your ravening appetites  When you are passing over these mountains poynting with his finger towarde the south mountaines you shall see another sea where they sayle with ships as bigge as yours using both sayles and ores as you doe although they men be naked as wee are 
But Balboa had beaten them to it he had decided not to wait  Seven months before while Castile was in his intemperate view still dithering he had set sail from Santa Maria for the coastal town of Acla at what Indians told him was the narrowest and least topographically inconvenient part of the Panamanian isthmus 
With Leoncico snapping genially at his heels with a force of 190 Spaniards and with several hundred more local guides and porters embarked on a fleet of nine canoes and a small ship named the Chapinera Balboa set out for Acla on the morning of Thursday 1 September 1513  He was bound as his biographer puts it for Careta the Pacific and immortality 
Only 92 men at arms and 2 priests began the route-march for Balboa was a prudent organizer keenly interested in security and he insisted that the others from Santa Maria remained at the base camp denying them their expected encounter with immortality  Enlarged by an escort of servants and porters and the sixteenth-century versions of groupies and hookers the marchers made an impressive column half a mile long 
Day by day under the hot September sun it wound its way steadily southwestwards stopping for a few hours here for half a week there while Balboa attempted in most cases successfully to make and consolidate friendships with the leaders of the tribes on whose lands he trod  The men crossed the low hills of the Serrania del DariÃ©n then proceeded to cut their way through the jungles in the valley of that great central Panamanian river variously called depending on whose map you buy the Chucanaque and the Abanumaque 
On the far side they came to the Sierra de Quareca hills which though not particularly high did give the party many of them clad in heavy metal cuirasses and leg-armour some relief from the steamy insect-ridden heat of the lowlands  But here Balboa 's persuasive charm did him no good a Chief Torecha leader of a tribe of mountain Caribs set about defending his lands and there was a brief and bloody battle which the Spaniards hardly surprisingly won 
Yet they were anything but magnanimous in their triumph at least not once they discovered to their corporate Castilian horror that some of the patricians of the region were soiled by the infamous vice the abominable sin of homosexuality  Nothing so riled a sixteenth-century conquistadore as the knowledge that some men indulged in sodomy and Balboa felt no compunction in setting the dreadful war-dogs on the culprits and having them tom to pieces in full public view 
It was a grisly episode indeed one which inevitably detracted from history 's judgement of the epochal events that were to follow  One can perhaps understand why John Keats writing his first mature work of poetry managed to confuse Balboa with Cortez a young and sensitive man Keats may well have balked at including a figure capable of such wanton cruelty in a sonnet devoted to such tender sentiments 
Balboa left Quareca the next day 25 September  There now follows among yesterday 's narrators and today 's historians one of those minor disputes of chronology from which whole doctoral theses are constructed and careers built or destroyed 
We need not bother with the details save to say that it is quite certain that all the contemporary accounts of Balboa 's triumph which mention that he first saw the Pacific at 10 am on Tuesday 25 September are wrong  25 September 1513 was a Sunday 
It is also a near-certainty that the discovery was not made on a Sunday  To these ardent Catholics domingo was a day with peculiar significance 
One can be perfectly sure that had such a momentous event happened on the Lord 's Day that fact alone would have been reported over and over again the comfortable synchronicity of it all being a matter for boundless pleasure  That the particular day of the sighting was never regarded as special and is almost brushed aside suggests that it was a Tuesday and the nearest Tuesday to the reported date is the 27th 
Choosing this date also allows Balboa and his company a little breathing space they can spend two full days marching from the unpleasantness in Quareca to the summits of the coastal range rather more reasonable a period than the few hours that elapse if we believe the earlier date  This then is the historical moment 10 am Tuesday 27 September 1513 
As for the historical place technically says Balboa 's biographer the peak was not in DariÃ©n nor was it actually a peak  Cartographic logic suggests it was in fact an isolated hill that stands above the headwaters of the Rio Congo an unspectacular 1,800 ft-high hillock somewhat denuded of trees a short distance away from a rudimentary track made by wild pigs or cattle or perhaps by people long ago which can still be discerned in the jungle 
Antonio de Herrera 's History published in Madrid eighty-eight years later records the moment thus  Balboa 
commanded his armie to halt and himselfe went alone to the toppe where having sighted the Mar del Sur he knelt down and raising his hands to Heaven pouring forth mighty praises to God for His great grace in having made him the first man to discover and sight it  Having made this pious demonstration he signalled to all his people to come up and they in their turn fell on their knees rendering thanks to God for this great favour while the Indians stood amazed at the rejoicing and the ecstasy of the Castilians

Two days later on 29 September the Feast of St Michael and All Angels Balboa and his men arrived on the shores of the great sea to take possession of it for God and for Castile  The ceremony was supposed to start at 2 pm on the 29th the Gulf on whose beach the men found themselves had been named San Miguel because of the happy coincidence of the feast day 
But it very nearly had to be postponed  No oceanographer when Balboa first strolled down to the gently lapping waters on the morning of that day he had no reason to suppose that the ceremony which would involve him standing ankle-deep in the water the better to annex it could not begin on schedule 
But he knew nothing of the Pacific 's tides  The tidal range in the Caribbean sea off the north coast of Panama is very modest no more than a couple of feet 
The tidal variation of the Pacific on the south side however is most impressive a good 18 feet under normal circumstances more than 20 feet at springs  And when the Captain-General and his men turned up in the afternoon all in polished armour and bearing a gaudy new flag adorned with the arms of Castile and Leon and a Madonna and Child they were dismayed embarrassed horrified amused history does not record to find no sea in sight just hundreds of yards of black and rank-smelling mud 
No claim to the new ocean could be made by standing in a nearby bog Balboa knew his law  And so the group waited and waited until not long before dusk the sea raged in with great impetus and the process of annexation could begin 
To judge from the surviving accounts of the escribano detailed for the occasion it was a ceremony that today would have been ideal grist for the television networks  There stood Balboa his shield on his arm his cuirass gleaming on his chest the brilliant new banner in one hand and his naked sword in the other his plumed helmet giving him a stature far more considerable than offered by his height alone 
He waded into the sea until the waters lapped against his knees while Leoncico splashed happily along behind him perhaps reflecting how far he and his master had come since both were smuggled in a flour barrel on a boat to DariÃ©n  The great man paced back and forth uttering as he did so a formula of annexation appropriate to the moment 
Long live the High and Mighty Sovereigns Don Fernando and DoÃ±a Juana Kings of Castile and of Leon and of Aragon et cetera in whose names and for the royal crown of Castile I take and assume royal possession corporal and present of these austral seas and lands and coasts and islands with everything annexed to them or which might pertain to them in whatever manner or by whatever reason or title might or could exist ancient or modem in times past present or to come without gainsay whatsoever  And should any other prince or captain Christian or infidel of whatever law or sect or condition he may be pretend to any right to these lands and seas I am ready and prepared to deny him and to defend them in the names of the Kings of Castile present and future whose is this empire and the dominion of these Indies islands and mainland northern and southern with their seas in the arctic pole as in the antarctic on both sides of the equinoctial line within and without the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn so that each thing and part of it belong and appertain most completely to Their Highnesses and to their successors as I declare more at length by writ setting forth all that may be said or can be said and alleged in behalf of their royal patrimony now and for all time so long as the world shall last until the final universal judgement of all mortals

Few annexations come more comprehensive than that  It is largely thanks to this one moment of history that there currently exists an unbroken line of Spanish-speaking nations through 90Â° of latitude from Tijuana in northern Mexico to Punta Arenas in southern Chile 
One can reasonably say that Balboa 's triumph ultimately gave us San Diego and Los Angeles Santa Barbara and Yerba Buena San Ysidro and San Onofre San Clemente and San Francisco  At this distance we may find Balboa 's antics in the surf laughably pretentious but at the time the sighting of the Mar del Sur as he felt compelled to christen the new sea was a formidable discovery indeed the implications of its swift and secure passage into the hands of Spain were profound in the extreme 
The fact that Balboa caused the Ocean to become a Spanish lake in effect would come to be recognized as one of the most important stratagems in the development of the modern world  There is a tragic postscript to the tale of Vasco NÃºÃ±ez a man judged by today 's historians to have been as kindly loyal and competent a conquistadore as ever brought the cross and the banner of Castile overseas 
By the time the news of his triumph had been transmitted home to the Court the Pedrarias expedition was on its way  It was a considerable party 2,000 men in twenty ships and headed by an intemperate ruffian whose only qualification for replacing Balboa as Governor of DariÃ©n was that his wife was the daughter of one of Isabella 's ladies-in-waiting 
The contrast between the two men was as profound as their rivalry was to become  Balboa was constructive in his approach to the Isthmus generally compassionate to the Indians inventive in his plans for exploration and the furthering of Imperial aims 
He achieved a great feat of maritime engineering by building ships on the Atlantic shore transporting them bodily over the hills he had explored and sailing them off into the Pacific  DÃ¡vila however was a bully a cruel and insecure man whose constant attacks on the Indians succeeded in turning them from sheep as Balboa called them into fierce lyons 
Eventually the contest between the new Governor and the man he had replaced became violent Balboa and four of his colleagues summoned from their Pacific base to discuss matters of common concern with Pedrarias were instead arrested  They were accused of rebellion murder treason and ironically in view of the circumstances the mistreatment of the Indians 
There was a show trial the five were beheaded in public and their heads placed on poles  And in a building that stood ten or twelve paces from the place where they were beheaded one after the other like sheep wrote a Spanish historian was Pedrarias watching them between the canes which formed the walls of his house 
A statue to Balboa stands near the Pacific exit of the Panama Canal in the town named in his honour  He is standing as he must have stood that afternoon on the shore of the Gulf of San Miguel four-square and haughty bucklered helmeted spurred and looking out over the greatest ocean in the world 
I took a rather simpler route than Balboa the Pan-American highway out of Panama City  This is a road of great promise as one might expect of a highway that is paved almost all the way from Barrow in Alaska to Ushuaia in Argentina and is at 16,000 miles the longest continuous route in the world 
A formal concept since 1923 millions of American dollars have been spent on it and it has been virtually complete for years  Complete that is except for one irritating and one might have thought locally embarrassing gap in Panama 
The DariÃ©n Gap  No road has ever been built clear across DariÃ©n nor one imagines will one ever be built 
Balboa might find it amusing nearly five centuries later the land he crossed in the sixteenth century on foot has still not been completely bridged for those crossing it by car  I found this less amusing when on the outskirts of a grimy little town called Chepo the highway quite simply fell apart under my wheels 
One second I had been speeding at fifty miles an hour along a ribbon of uninterrupted concrete the next to the wide-eyed amusement of a group of policemen standing beside a checkpoint there was a loud crunch every shock absorber on the Nissan thudded home to its end-stops and I found myself dead in the water by a pothole large enough to accommodate half Balboa 's army  The dust began to clear after half a minute 
A donkey grazed morosely beside me  The policemen guffawed 
The air was full of mosquitoes  It was very hot and sticky and as the dust cleared still further so the hills ahead shimmered in a pale blue haze 
It took an hour to free the Nissan from what I assumed to be its grave and persuade its bent and battered metal to press on southwards  The road worsened as I edged gingerly down along the country 's sunken spine vanishing at times in coils of thick black mud 
Elsewhere tractors had scoured deep gullies separated by huge ridges that threatened to strand the little car with its wheels thrashing uselessly in space  The bridges were awesome in their fragility and ill-repair loose plates of iron rattled and slipped away to reveal brief visions of dark and menacing deeps filled no doubt with crocodiles man-eating fish and swimming snakes 
In several places the road simply ceased to exist at all there were cliffs a hole 50 feet wide and 10 feet deep  A muddy cut through the jungle showed where the last car had passed around it 
A rusting hulk at the bottom of the pit showed where the last car had n't  Five hours later after I had passed beneath a crudely-lettered blue notice board that welcomed travellers to the unpeopled jungle vastness of DariÃ©n I came to a wooden sign that said simply Sante FÃ© 
I turned off to the right  The car protested as it settled into muddy pools heaved itself out scraped through fields of boulders and crossed innumerable rickety bamboo bridges 
Finally I passed rows of sombre-looking huts blackened by cooking smoke and infested by scores of small children and large dogs  There was a small shop stocked with boxes of soap powder dried and blackish-red carcasses of goats tins of condensed milk and posters of Madonna 
Outside a low white cement building with a radio aerial stood a tall negro with distinctly West African features wearing the neatly pressed uniform of an inspector in the CarabiÃ±eros National  He waved me to a halt and then proceeded to ask why on earth I a gringo had driven all this way to what was evidently one of the least visited and least remarkable villages in all Panama 
My Spanish at least when I attempted to speak it was execrable  So I wrote my request on a sheet of paper 
The brief dialogue I later found preserved along with the car rental papers  Es posible con los miniculares a vuer el Mar Pacifico sur los montaÃ±as 
I gestured to the low hills rising to the west of his police station  Si the policeman wrote 
I was encouraged  Donde SeÃ±or Balboa el primero conquistadore quando el vuer el Mar Pacifico 
The policeman smiled broadly then wrote quickly El Hindio William conose el te puede llebar  Pero le reconose algo al cabo y ami 
So the Indian named William did exist and moreover he lived close by  The policeman who was even now shutting up his office was evidently going to guide me there 
Fifteen minutes later having banged and bumped our way up another track heading directly for the low hills the two of us came to the small tin-roofed hut which I had imagined and there standing before it was the single link required to bring Balboa 's journey and mine into their final conjunction  William busily digging some unrecognizable vegetable out of the mud was wearing gumboots and the jaunty remnants of a straw hat 
Not however a Panama hat since those are only worn in Ecuador  When the policeman told him what was wanted he removed his hat wiped his brow and looked at the sky it was mid-afternoon and there would be only three hours of light remaining 
Then he gestured towards the rise ahead and to a path snaking into the undergrowth  Dos horas he said and without a backward glance began walking up the hill 
Panama City like most Central and South American capitals is littered with statues of temples to and mausoleums occupied by the famous the not-so-famous and the forgotten  In nearly all the Spanish-speaking world it is almost axiomatic that any half-significant event any battle revolution or skirmish is memorialized in an extravagant confection of marble and gilt with crosses acanthus leaves Castilian doggerel and an invocation of the deity 
One might reasonably have expected therefore that the one historical event for which Panama is known and there is a clear distinction to be drawn here between an event and an accomplishment for obviously the Canal is Panama 's best-known triumph and has become its own memorial should be remembered in an impressive construction no matter how far from anywhere or how difficult of access the site may be  But Balboa 's hill if that really is the hill to which William takes his occasional visitors is quite unmarked 
It is exactly as the explorer 's biographer predicted it would be 1,800 feet high half-covered with jungle a little way off the trans-Isthmian Indian tracks and somewhat detached from the rest of the Sierra an outlier distinct and somewhat aloof  It is in DariÃ©n however at least so far as Panama 's administrators are concerned 
And from its summit it is entirely possible to see a stretch of water which whether to a sixteenth-century viewer innocent of the details of geography or to a well-versed wanderer five centuries later could only be an ocean  It seemed remarkably near a flat blue sheet crawling as in Hong Kong with the skeins of hidden currents stippled and rippled by breezes and turning brassy gold where it met the horizon on to which the sun was now setting fast 
One or two small boats inched ahead of tiny trails of white water  To the left the south were the indentations of a swampy evil-looking coast where the shores of Panama curved and recurved to form the immense and nearly landlocked Gulf of San Miguel 
But to the right the level sea stretched far away an ocean on which a westbound mariner sticking to this latitude need not once he had cleared the complicated coastline of Panama itself strike any land whatsoever until he met the Philippine Islands of Mindanao Palawan and the skerries of the Sulu Sea 13,000 miles away  No other ocean is as wide 
The distance from Panama to Palawan is more than half the way around the world  And this was the ocean that Vasco NÃºÃ±ez de Balboa had found an immensity quite unimaginable but a void which he must have known was now no longer unbridgeable 
It would be agreeable to report that on at last sighting the ocean I like Vasco NÃºÃ±ez promptly prayed a lot rejoiced even more cut down a fine tree and erected a cross then had the expedition secretary carefully write down the names of all my companions for posterity  But in fact it was rapidly beginning to get dark 
The negro policeman was quite keen that I should stay the night in Santa FÃ©  William was more eager that he should show me some papers he had recently received by post from America 
And I was keen to return to Panama City to catch my plane  So we hurried back down the hill and to William 's little house 
The papers to which he had referred and which he kept in a tin box underneath his bed contained an unexpected coda to this small adventure an unfortunate little postscript which reminded me how Captain Scott must have felt when he reached the South Pole only to find that Amundsen had beaten him to it  For I was not the first to have stood in Balboa 's footprints 
The papers that William held related how just two months before me a man named William Dobelle describing himself as being on the artificial organs faculty at the University of Utah and the director of a medical device company in New York and Zurich claimed to have visited Balboa 's hill  He reported that he had come in by helicopter and had claimed the hill as Balboa 's on the advice of William and in a formal note to the Explorers ' Club of New York of which he was a member 
Dr Dobelle had found the whole experience so extraordinary that he had issued a press release no less recounting the adventure and had sent copies to William from his office in Farmington New York  Such were the papers which the Choco kept under his bed written on a Macintosh sent from Manhattan claiming a triumph with which William seemed notably unimpressed 
The modem world from which I had briefly stepped aside seemed to come crowding in again  Once I had said my thanks and farewells to William and to the immense policeman who had silently accompanied us throughout the afternoon I headed away down the rutted tracks rather glad to be back on the road and off back to Panama City 
Like Captain Scott I was in a hurry to get home  It was not an easy journey 
I had two punctures and was forced to abandon the Nissan  I had a long and wary walk through the pitch-dark jungles my wariness stemming from having sighted a large tarantula strolling down the road for its evening constitutional 
After what seemed an interminable period of tiptoeing down the road I managed to hitchhike a lift on the roof of a logging truck  I then waited until midnight in a tiny village where the local people plied me with beer and chickens until I could barely move 
Finally ten hours after I had started I arrived at Tocumen airfield back in one of the least pleasant cities in the Western hemisphere  But a mile or so away from Panama City linked to it by a discreet network of roads and side-streets that become suddenly cleaner neater less tropic less obviously corrupted is a city that bears the great conquistadore 's family name 
The city of Balboa looks for all the world like a suburban Texas town it has green lawns of tough-leaved grass cyclone fences large split-level houses young housewives in sunglasses and hair-curlers driving Camaros on their way to the Safeway American flags and American troops  For Balboa stands at the Pacific terminus of the Panama Canal one of the most remarkable examples of man 's enduring engineering skills one of the legacies of Balboa 's discovery and march 
Before I left for San Francisco I spent a few days wandering the considerable length and the decidedly inconsiderable breadth of the Canal newest of the major approaches to Balboa 's ocean  A ship 's master passing through the Panama Canal need have no concerns about having to navigate his way successfully into the Pacific 
He does n't have to steer at all he does n't look at his compass he need not even run his engines his vessel is quite literally pulled out of one ocean and into the other by a sextet of electrically-powered and Japanese-made trains called mules which run on American cast-iron rails beside the lock-gates of the Canal all the captain has to do is stand on the bridge and watch listen to the genial Yankee twang of his assigned American pilot and experience a transport of delight  For a passage through Panama is very much a delight 
While it must be admitted that the republic in which it is set down has its less attractive aspects the Canal itself is a thing of unexpected spectacle and beauty  Its sheer size is impressive of course and a first-time transit from Atlantic to Pacific will be something of a revelation the ship does not head due westward to get to Balboa 's ocean but south-east 
Further a quirk of the Coriolis Force means that the journey is slightly uphill with the Pacific Ocean about six inches higher than the Atlantic  But the beauty of George Washington Goethals ' eighty-year-old construction becomes apparent within moments of arrival 
Lake Gatun into which the ships pass on a due southerly track after leaving the Caribbean and easing through the first set of locks is an immense inland lake though an artificial one created by the damming of the Chagres River  The Tiger Islands the Brujas Islands and the Trinidad Islands are the summits of drowned hills covered with tropical jungle and noisy with a hundred kinds of colourful birds 
There are spiders too an engineer inspecting the Lake as it was filling reported seeing a half-drowned tree covered with what appeared to be black foliage he paddled alongside then shot away as fast as his blades could carry him  The leaves were tens of thousands of tarantulas clinging to the branches to delay their inevitable death 
The route turns south-easterly after Gatun through the deep chasm of the Gaillard Cut eight miles of near-straight canal where the labours ant tribulations of all Goethals ' thousands of men become dramatically evident  Here truly one can see writ large the truth of the Canal Commission 's simple motto the Land divided the World united or applaud the brief laureateship of the poet Stafford who wrote to celebrate the Canal 's opening day in 1914 
In freedom let the great ships go On freedom 's errand sea to sea The oceans rise the hills bend low Servants of Liberty  In freedom let the great ships go On freedom 's errand sea to sea The oceans rise the hills bend low Servants of Liberty 
The Cut 500 feet wide from shore to shore 45 feet deep illuminated at night by a blaze of red and white lights is of a size to dwarf the vessels passing through it  From down on deck the cliffs rise up to the sky quite blotting out the sun from 400 feet up at the viewing platform on Contractors Hill the passing tramps container vessels and car carriers look like toys 
Far below on the winter 's day when I stood and watched the Aleksandr Ulyanov a 30,000-ton general freighter was grinding slowly northbound back to the Atlantic back to Mother Russia a comfortable-looking rust-stained Greek liner called the Corfu Reefer had passed heading south  The Mar Mediterraneo was waiting in the Pedro Miguel locks 
The Hyundai No. 205 carrying cars from Pusan to Savannah was coming through the Miraflores  And there seemed an almost endless queue of freighters tankers and oreships waiting in the roads at each end some at anchor some jostling politely for the lock entrances 
Thirty ships make the nine-hour transit through Panama each day 11,000 a year carrying more than 130 million tons of cargo to and from every country on earth  Warships pleasure boats container ships Britain 's royal yacht Britannia was due some days later all saving themselves 8,000 miles and three weeks of sailing round the Horn 
None seemed to begrudge handing over the thousands of dollars in tolls payable in cash by each ship to the Canal Commission which brought in more than Â£150 million in 1988  And few aboard whether captain or crew seemed anything less than awestruck during the entire nine hours that a transit usually takes 
I watched the crew of a grubby Polish reefer vessel they were taking pictures of each other against the background of the Gatun Locks three hours later they were gazing with rapt attention at the passing majesty of Culebra their cameras were out again for the Pedro Miguel for the distant flags of the American bases for the Miraflores Locks and for the immense red-white-and-blue bandera of the Panama Republic that waved lazily from the summit of Mount Ancon over the old wooden houses of Panama City  And as the ship freed herself from the mule-lines and her screw began to chum up a wake of umber sludgy water and she picked up speed towards the marker buoys and the farewell beacon on Flamenco Island I was sure I could see the seamen still pointing their cameras back now with long lenses all towards the statue of Balboa which stands on the Panama City seafront with the great man gazing out at the Ocean into which the Poles were now at long last sailing 
Once Balboa had found the Ocean so in their droves the explorers emerged to circle probe and colonize it but first in that most daring of all endeavours to cross it  No one could be sure how wide it was 
No one could be sure where lay the Terra Australis Incognita which Ptolemy had postulated and which Mercator had argued was a necessary balance for a spherical world without which the whole planet might simply topple over to be lost among the stars  No one knew the weather the currents or the winds 
There was only one certainty one small piece of reasoned and deduced fact which spurred the would-be circumnavigators onwards  This certainty was that the Spice Islands the Moluccas lay at the farthest side of the Mar del Sur or of whatever might lie beyond the waters that Balboa saw 
The position of the Spice Islands was more or less well known  Traders buying nutmegs and doves from Arabian merchants had been aware of their existence for centuries Marco Polo knew roughly where they were for he saw junk traffic in the ports of Cathay loaded down with spices and manned by suntanned crews who had clearly come there from the south 
Then in 1511 a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio d'Abreu discovered them  His party of three ships had travelled from Lisbon out to Malacca with Albuquerque thence down the Strait and past the immense island of Borneo to the confused archipelago where all spices known to man grew in wild profusion 
To reach their goal d'Abreu 's men had gone halfway round the world from Europe to the Orient and always in directions with an easterly component  This single geographical fact though dictated by circumstance was of great political and imperial importance 
For since the Treaty of Tordesillas signed in 1494 all the unknown world to the east of an imaginary line drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands would belong to Portugal everything to the west of that line would belong to Spain  So far as the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans were concerned there was no problem but what about the other side of the world 
Where the scholars and the diplomats debated was the antimeridian of the Tordesillas line  No decision had been taken in those first decades of the sixteenth century 
Conquest squatters ' rights annexation force majeure these cruder tools of geopolitics might well dictate its eventual position  Thus the Moluccas discovered by going eastabout would by the logic of some explorers belong to Portugal 
The Moluccas claimed by a party going westwards might belong to Spain  So while d'Abreu and his colleagues went off eastwards even braver or more foolhardy men following the banner of Castile were determined to discover heroically and as it turned out for many of them fatally the way to reach this same Orient by travelling outwards to the West across the vast unknown 
It meant the acquisition of knowledge to be sure but it also meant the envelopment and direction of the Orient by Spanish adelantados for the greater glory and expansion of the vast empire of Spain  There is thus a nice irony in the fact that the man who undertook the seminal voyage and did so in the name of Spain was in fact Portuguese 
He was born FemÃ£o de MagalhÃ£es and the Portuguese he is ours they insist rarely care to acknowledge that he renounced his citizenship after a row pledged his allegiance to King Charles I later to become the Emperor Charles V and was given a new name Hernando de Magallanes  The English-speaking world which reveres him quite as much as does Iberia knows him as Ferdinand Magellan 
There is a statue to Ferdinand Magellan in the main square of Punta Arenas at the southernmost tip of Chile  He sits by a globe with his back to the police station looking south towards the Cabo de Hornos Hotel towards the low hills of Tierra del Fuego and the unseen coast of the distant Antarctic 
Another monument to him is in the main square of the city of Cebu in the central Philippines a canopy with the kind of gaudy murals one expects in this flamboyant tropic city  The paintings illustrate the notable moments of his forty years of life including that most singular to the Filipinos the bringing of Christianity to their islands 
Nearby on a small marshy mosquito-ridden island called Mactan the site of Cebu airport and some of the region 's hundreds of guitar factories there is a simple memorial looked after by a caretaker with the improbably contradictory name of Jesus Baring of which more later  Doubtless there are other statues to Magellan near Sabrosa in Portugal 's TrÃ¡s-os-Montes where he was born in Sanlucar de Barrameda from where he set sail 
But the life that will be always remembered stems from a journey which will never be forgotten that commemorated by the space of sea between the statues in Chile and Cebu a distance of some 12,000 miles  Edward Gaylord Bourne in his masterly series Spain in America written at the beginning of this century offers a view with which few would take issue 
The first navigation of the Straits of Magellan was a far more difficult problem of seamanship than crossing the Atlantic  Columbus 's voyage was over in thirty-five days but Magellan 's had been gone a year and weathered a subAntarctic winter before the real task began the voyage over a trackless waste of waters exactly three times as long as the first crossing of the Atlantic 
Magellan is to be ranked as the first navigator of ancient or modern times and his voyage is the greatest single human achievement on the sea  The first navigation of the Straits of Magellan was a far more difficult problem of seamanship than crossing the Atlantic 
Columbus 's voyage was over in thirty-five days but Magellan 's had been gone a year and weathered a subAntarctic winter before the real task began the voyage over a trackless waste of waters exactly three times as long as the first crossing of the Atlantic  Magellan is to be ranked as the first navigator of ancient or modern times and his voyage is the greatest single human achievement on the sea 
Yet when he set off on 20 September 1519 with a royal mandate to search for a passage through to the Mar del Sur and thus to determine for certain that the Spice Islands were within the Spanish domains he had not the foggiest notion how far he might have to travel  Not only was there great perplexity about the existence of a Strait for all the men in their five little ships knew Balboa 's Panama and the Columbia that Columbus had sighted in 1499 might be the equatorial portions of a continent that extended without a break to the Antarctic pole and the Southern Sea would be quite unreachable from the west 
And even if a break were to be found the five naos and the 277 men would have to sail how far  Schoener 's globe of the world then known shows Japan a few hundred miles off Mexico the historian LÃ³pez de Gomara says that in his negotiations with the Emperor Magellan always insisted that the Moluccas were no great distance from Panama and the Gulf of San Miguel which Vasco NÃºÃ±ez de Balboa discovered 
He would rapidly discover precisely what no great distance meant  The five vessels that would soon make history the Vittoria now generally known as the Victoria the Trinidada the Trinidad the San Antonio the ConcepciÃ³n and the Santiago were small and until Magellan set to work on them hopelessly unseaworthy 
I would not care to sail to the Canaries in such crates wrote the Portuguese consul in Seville with obvious pleasure  Their ribs are soft as butter 
They set sail from the Guadalquivir River under the proud corporate title of the Armada de Molucca amply armed but hopelessly provisioned with crews composed of men of nine different nationalities and of innumerable and in many cases mutually antagonistic temperaments  There was one Moluccan slave Enrique who would act as an interpreter if the crossing was accomplished 
There was a journalist too or maybe Antonio Francesca Pigafetta was a Venetian spy since he came from Venice was an acquaintance of the Doge and could well have been told to keep a wary eye on Spanish imperial ambitions in the East  Be that as it may Pigafetta 's diaries of the journey remain the classic source for all future accounts of the voyage he had joined the ships he said because he was desirous of sailing with the expedition so that he might see the wonders of the world 
The sorry tales of sodomy and mutiny of yard-arm justice and abrupt changes of command and all the other trials that attended the Armada on its path south and west across the Atlantic do not belong here  The truly important phase of the journey was to begin on Candlemas Day 2 February 1520 when the vessels left their anchorage in the River Plate near today 's Montevideo and headed south 
No charts or sailing directions then existed for the coast beyond Cabo Santa Maria no one had ventured this way before  From this moment on the sailors were passing through virgin territory with unknown coasts increasingly terrifying seas and temperatures that went steadily downwards day by day 
They began to see penguins ducks without wings they called them patos sin alas and sea-wolves or seals  They explored every indentation in the coast off which they sailed and with depressing regularity each indentation even though some of them were very large and tempted the navigators to believe that they might be the longed-for straits proved to be a cul-de-sac 
They spent much of the winter from Palm Sunday until late August in the centre of a chilly and miserable bay at what is now Puerto San JuliÃ¡n a winter made doubly wretched by an appalling mutiny and the consequent executions and maroonings that Magellan ordered by the stranding and wrecking of the Santiago which the Captain-General had sent on a sounding expedition and by the realization of the dreadful damage done to the remaining ships by the constant chomping and feasting of those plank-gourmets of the seas the teredo worms  But one important discovery was made at Puerto San JuliÃ¡n these southern plains were inhabited by enormous nomadic shepherds though they herded not sheep but the little wild llamas known as guanacos and they dressed in their skins 
Magellan captured a number of these immense people one pair by the crud trick of showing them leg-irons and insisting that the proper way to carry them was to allow them to be locked around their ankles  Women were brought aboard the ships too but the crews despite so many months away from female company did not find much sexually attractive about them 
They were immensely hairy had breasts that hung down at least a yard and were used by the males as beasts of burden  But the men liked the giants ' tricks one used to swallow and then regurgitate long arrows as in a circus and another who allowed himself to be called Juan and learned some biblical phrases caught and ate all the rats and mice on board to the entertainment of the men and the pleasure of the cook 
Magellan who like everybody else was awed by their size called these men patagones big feet the land in which he found them became and has been ever since Patagonia  Despite the amusement such indigenes provided the months at anchor in so depressing a place wore on Magellan and by late August he was off south again with the four ships that remained 
Two men had been left behind marooned on his orders for mutiny they had a supply of wine and hardtack and guns and shot but when other later expeditions entered the Bay they found no trace of them  They may have been killed by the giants they may have starved to death all the men of the Armada remembered were the pitiful wails of the pair echoing over the still waters as the ships sailed back into the open sea and south 
By the time the flotilla had reached a latitude of 50Â°S and had stopped again for rest and replenishment the men were becoming restive once more their plea now was if the expedition wanted to reach the Spice Islands why not turn east towards them and pass below the Cape of Good Hope as usual  Magellan refused of course except that he was evidently frustrated enough at the lack of success in finding a way through to promise that if no strait was found by the time they had eaten up another 25Â° of latitude he would turn east as they wished 
The murmurs stilled  The weather became colder the seas outside rougher and stormier 
One wonders if the Captain-General had any idea of the utter impossibility of navigating at 75Â°S for on this longitudinal track his ships would be stuck fast in the thick ice-of the Weddell Sea hemmed in by the unimagined continent and unendurable cold of the Antarctic  The four ships got going once again on 17 October 
Four days later on 21 October 1520 a day celebrated throughout the Catholic world as the Feast of St Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins Magellan sighted a headland  Cabo Virgenes which is today surmounted by a lighthouse that flashes a powerful beam every five seconds as well as with a foghorn and a radio direction beacon is perhaps the most navigationally important point on the Atlantic coast of South America 
For this modest Cape as Magellan and his men were soon to discover marks the eastern end of the Strait that shall forever bear his name the entrance at long last to the Mar del Sur  At first they had no idea that the stretch of pale shallow water beyond the Cape would present them with anything more than another disappointment 
Ranges of immense snow-covered mountains crowded into view there could Magellan thought be no possible exit  Nonetheless he ordered the San Antonio and the ConcepciÃ³n into the headwaters of the bay only to be horrified when he saw them being swept by unsuspected currents and winds into a huge maelstrom of surf and spindrift and on to a wicked-looking spur of black rock 
He had already lost the Santiago now it was beginning to look as though two other ships were doomed  The whole expedition was turning it seemed into a fatal shambles 
But he had no time to dwell on these particular miseries for an immense storm broke and his own ship the Trinidad and the Victoria alongside were themselves imperilled  Men were hurled overboard one vessel was dismasted the other nearly turned turtle several times 
And the storm went on and on and on when finally relief came to the exhausted crews it seemed the only recourse was to turn tail and head for home  The expedition was over an abject failure 
Yet just at that moment one occasionally suspects that the mythmakers have been at work on the story the lookout sighted sails on the western horizon  They were indeed what they could only have been-the two scouting vessels which had returned safe and sound 
Yet the joy Magellan must have felt at realizing his men were still alive was as nothing when he saw as the tiny naos drew closer that their yardarms were hung with bunting that music was playing and the crews were dancing singing and shouting  It became clear in an instant that they had found the paso 
Suddenly as an account of their voyage puts it they saw a narrow passage like the mouth of a river ahead of them in the surf and they managed to steer into it  Driven on by wind and tide they raced through this passage and into a wide lake 
Still driven by the storm they were carried west for some hours into another narrow passage though now the current had reversed so what appeared to be a great ebb-tide came rushing towards them  They debouched from this second strait into a broad body of water which stretched as far as the eye could see toward the setting sun 
Suddenly as an account of their voyage puts it they saw a narrow passage like the mouth of a river ahead of them in the surf and they managed to steer into it  Driven on by wind and tide they raced through this passage and into a wide lake 
Still driven by the storm they were carried west for some hours into another narrow passage though now the current had reversed so what appeared to be a great ebb-tide came rushing towards them  They debouched from this second strait into a broad body of water which stretched as far as the eye could see toward the setting sun 
By the application of good marine logic tasting the water and finding it salty then making sure the ebb and flood-tides were of equal strength both tests which argued against this body of water being a river they realized that they had indeed discovered the way through  Magellan overjoyed and believing that his ultimate goal was within his grasp brushed aside the doubters ' view that he should despite the discovery turn back eastwards for the Moluccas 
Though we have nothing to eat but the leather wrapping from our masts he declared we shall go on  The Estrecho de Magallanes as Admiralty Chart No. 554 is content to call it is as darkly beautiful as it is useful 
Before I first visited I supposed wrongly that since the latitudes are more or less the same the coastline would be vaguely similar to that of Maine or New Brunswick  But it is in fact much starker more hostile more grand 
From the east the direction taken by Magellan the land begins flat and windswept mean grassland with tumbleweed rolling endlessly before the gales  The wind reduces such trees as there are to stunted survivors 
There are virtually no deciduous trees aside from a few beeches seen halfway along the Strait near the modern coaling-station of Punta Arenas  In consequence there are no autumn colours to be viewed in surroundings that look as though there should be no golds and flaming reds to set off the whites blues and blacks of snow water and rock 
In summer the box-leafed barberry or calafate blooms bright yellow flowers small blue berries  There are sphagnum bogs and spiny bushes and also in summer thousands of tiny polar flowers of apparent delicacy but great toughness 
The wildlife is very different too-penguins guanacos seals Patagonian foxes sea-lions  There are birds both magnificent Diomedea exulans the wandering albatross and five almost equally remarkable family members and flightless like the ostrich-like rhea and the ludicrous steamer duck 
Some birds are sinister the Carnero a mean-spirited grey monster is said to delight in picking out the eyeballs of shipwrecked sailors  The Strait is not an easy place for sailing vessels both difficult and dangerous because of incomplete surveys the lack of aids to navigation the great distance between anchorages the strong current and the narrow limits for the manoeuvring of vessels says the pilot manual 
Had Magellan and his men read today 's pilot they would no doubt have been reluctant to try to pass through  The coastline is now Chilean territory on both banks save for a minute touch of Argentina at the very western entrance 
Cabo Virgenes is part of the Argentine Republic and there are two lighthouses at Cabo Espiritu Santo on Tierra del Fuego one belonging to Argentina the other to Chile the frontier in between their duplication causes much confusion to seamen  The shores are littered with the relics of stranded vessels just on the seaward side of the first narrows the Primera Angostura are two magnificent old ships 
One is reduced to her ribs the other still has her steel plating and her funnel  Both are home to seabirds and seals and all manner of grasses and flowers 
They have washed up on a shingle strand beside a lonely and barely habitable estancia  Bored gauchos sit out of the wind sucking yerba matÃ© from gourds their horses munch at the thin grass in a desultory fashion 
The place is apparently being slowly abraded by a fine stinging dust blown across Patagonia by the unceasing gales  The wrecks are less exposed to the weather than they might be lying in the lee of a hill called improbably Mount Sutlej 
Though perhaps not quite so improbable a hulk I once saw stranded in Port Stanley in the nearby Falkland Islands was called the Jhelum and both Sutlej and Jhelum are names of rivers in the Punjab  Where I have often wondered since are South Atlantic ships or hills or plains named after the other three Punjab rivers the Indus the Chenab and the Ravi 
The two narrows are narrow indeed the first no more than half a mile wide and before the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 crowded with a mass of shipping  Today only the occasional vessel passes by when I was there a couple of Polish trawlers bound for repairs in Punta Arenas an oiler from the American Navy bound for an Antarctic research ship 
A shabby little ferry chuckles across every couple of hours taking lorries and a few cars on the quickest route between Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego  Once through the narrows and having explored and discounted tempting-looking passages that turned out to go nowhere Bahia InÃºtil one can almost sense Magellan growling with irritation as he named this immense body of water useless the Captain-General entered the narrow waterway that would eventually take him into the neighbour-ocean 
He had turned a comer  Until now his ships had been on a southerly course the weather becoming even colder the unexpected winds known now as williwaws threatening to dash his vessels against the steep cliffs 
But now having passed Cape Froward at nearly 54Â°S he was heading north and would not be so far south again ever in his life  By now he had lost another ship 
Though he did not know it the San Antonio had turned tail and was even now on her way back to Spain bearing a cargo of falsehood against Magellan  She also took away supplies that were vital for all the fleet a third of the Armada 's biscuit supply a third of its meat and sixty per cent of its currants chickpeas and figs 
Her captain quite probably sighted the Falkland Islands on his way back something about which Magellan was never to know nor care  He had but three vessels left and despite urgent pleas from his men now demoralized again fretful once they realized another ship was gone to abandon the voyage and sail back to the Guadalquivir he pressed on north-westwards passing through scenery of a wild grandeur and beauty he had never known before 
The trio of vessels with a combined weight less than one of today 's jumbo jets passed the tip of a small island where it was dear the two oceans ' waters met the point is now named Crosstides and through the Paso Tortuosa  Then deciding boldly not to enter another beguiling-looking passage which had he done so would have wasted very many miles and many days it is now called Canal Jeronimo and leads into an immense maze of lakes and passageways he sailed directly north-west up the Paso Largo and finally into the Paso del Mar 
Here huge surges of Pacific water sensed as mere vibrations once they had rounded Cape Froward now rocked their boats from stem to stern  Stiff westerly winds made forward passage difficult and the little boats had to tack this way and that within the narrow confines of the Strait 's exit before the funnel began to widen and the open sea to present itself Magellan now perfectly confident of his discovery named the waters Estrecho do Todos los Santos All Saints ' Strait 
It was a name that would swiftly give way to his once his heroism and navigational skill were recognized back home  There is some dispute about the date upon which Trinidad Victoria and ConcepciÃ³n passed into the Mar del Sur 
Antonio Pigafetta the journalist or Doge 's spy says 28 November one distinguished eighteenth-century historian says the 27th another of equal distinction puts it a day earlier  Whichever is correct we know that Magellan named the final cape Deseado for we had long been desiring it 
We also know that the iron-willed Admiral broke down and cried on hearing that Balboa 's ocean had at last been sighted  Unhappily his chosen name Deseado barely survives today the dramatic and unlit cliff on Isla DesolaciÃ³n that marks the western exit of the Strait is now called Cabo Pilar 
Deseado is a smaller cape to its south generally ignored except by sentimental mariners of whom there are these days and in these waters rather few  The day when the ships passed the tip of Desolation Island was rough and stormy the typical robust westerly weather for which Cape Horn is notorious 
The mariners spent the night in such shelter as they could find from the 30-knot winds drenching squalls and menacing waves  At daybreak though they passed out into the ocean proper still heating to the north-west to get out of the miserable cold 
They passed the Strait 's tiny guardian islands the Evangelistas where there is now both a lighthouse ant a Chilean signal station and sailed into an evening that suddenly became magically serene  Ferdinand Magellan assembled his men on deck 
Father Pedro de Valderrama the Trinidad 's padre stood on the poop deck and called down on the crew of all three remaining vessels the blessing of Our Lady of Victory  The men sang hymns 
The gunners fired broadsides  And Magellan just as Balboa had done seven years before proudly unfurled the flag of Castile 
But he had none of the grandiloquence of Vasco NÃºÃ±ez he uttered none of the proud formulae Balboa had uttered in the Gulf of San Migud  What he said if contemporary accounts are to be believed includes the first use of the word that as a geographical descriptive and identifier is central to this book and if one accepts the dominant economic theses of today central to the future development of the planet 
We are about to stand into an ocean where no ship has ever sailed before Magellan is said to have cried though it has to be reiterated that there is no hard evidence that he dit so  May the ocean be always as calm and benevolent as it is today 
In this hope I name it the Mar Pacifico  And just in case it was not Magellan who & t uttered the word then perhaps it was Pigafetta We debouched from that Strait he later wrote engulfing ourselves in the Pacific Sea 
Unknown to Magellan and his crew for they lived fully three centuries before Alfred Wegener advanced his theory of continental drift the spot where they chanced upon the new ocean is one of the great tectonic landmarks of the world  A few miles from where the tiny ships first debouched from the Strait is a spot which marks one of the suture-lines of the planet one of those rare sites where can be seen the brushstrokes of creation 
I went there once to see a place that was thus twice blessed by histories both recent and more ancient  I had travelled down to Punta Arenas which the biblical authority of the South American Handbook said was the best jumping-off point 
Within two days of leaving the warm winter of Hong Kong I was standing shivering in the endless summer gales of the roaring forties on the shores of the Magellan Strait if not obviously at the edge of any tectonic plates then certainly at the very edge of the world  It was New Year 's Eve and the midnight sky was still bright Punta Arenas is at 53Â°S and although on a similar longitude to Halifax has been shunted by Professor Dowd 's descendants into the same time zone as New York all of which means that it stays light for a great deal longer than in most cities and we celebrated the coming of the New Year in almost broad daylight 
The few ships out in the harbour sent up fireworks and flares and the low hills around town echoed with the wail of sirens and foghorns at least until the dark did set in at about three in the morning  By that time I had made drinking friends in the Hotel Cabo de Hornos with a couple of young American teachers down from Ecuador who had long wanted to visit the Towers of Paine the very spot where geologists had written the two tectonic plates in which I was interested had come together 
They spoke good Spanish if they promised to interpret for me I said I 'd rent a car and give them a ride  The next morning the wind still blew from the west 
Beyond town beyond the extraordinary cemetery for the pioneers who had created the place and the Indians who had tried to frustrate them and once the shanties had petered out the Patagonian landscape was flat and treeless and the gale howled across it without ceasing  For a few miles as we hugged the shore of the Strait the northbound road was paved but once we had passed a junction and the track leading eastwards across to Argentina it reverted to rutted gravel and the wind blew little spirals of dust across it like ectoplasmic tumbleweed 
We saw a great many sheep of course grazing on the peat-grass and the bog-myrtle and every once in a while some miles back from the road an estancia a collection of farm buildings like white dolls ' houses tiny on the immense plain  Some owners had tried to plant pines as windbreaks but they were stunted little trees now huddling themselves for protection in the shadow of the buildings 
I stopped to take a photograph of one estancia that I knew belonged to a Scottish family who had lived there for five generations even from two miles away I could hear the rhythmic clattering of the tin roof as it was lifted and dropped by the gales  The womenfolk would no doubt be beside the wood stove talking over the din of the roof as they did their needlework the men would be in the wool-shed cleansing and grading the fleeces in time for the next lorry down to port 
Scotland must have seemed a fair way away and no chance this year of a real Hogmanay  At a place called Morro Chico there was a tiny inn where we sat around the stove ourselves 
We were given mugs of coffee and slices of black bun a dark Christmas-time cake that had come from Scotland too  The innkeepers I had enough Spanish to recognize their curious Patagonian accent all rolling rs and glottal stops took me outside to show off a baby rhea they kept in a pen 
It had been hit by a passing lorry and they joked that it would never fly again  It was a joke because rheas which look like small ostriches only with an extra toe on each foot can not fly anyway 
This one hobbled about gamely seemingly eager to get back to the open plains  Soon after Morro Chico the plains began to undulate and then in the distance we spied the mountains the southern Andes 
The road was now backing west towards the sea and towards the place where I fancied we might see evidence of major geophysics at work  We first met Pacific waters at the windswept village of Puerto Natales and suddenly there were mountains all around us mountains and glaciers and curious seabirds and dolphins and spume-whipped sea the water a vivid blue under a cloudless sky 
It was breathtaking in its beauty  The exiles from Ecuador more accustomed to jungle and soggy heat had gasped unashamedly as we rounded the bend above the cliffs and they remained quite mute awestruck as we circled down into town and parked outside the Hotel Eberhardt for a dish of the king crab centolla and a mug of beer 
The ocean which appeared to stretch across all our visible horizon was in fact a loch Ultima Esperanza a sea-loch that reached 200 miles inland and from where Pacific shipping could in theory if the master was good and the compass correct navigate its way deep inside the Andean chain  There was a small cutter parked at the jetty and a sign taped to the Eberhardt window said that for $15 each she would take us right up to the foot of the Balmaceda and Serrano glaciers which spilled from the southern tip of that immense high-altitude sheet of white that was the Patagonian ice-cap 
But we were driving to the ice-cap anyway and needed to reach the peaks by nightfall  So we contented ourselves instead by watching a troupe of steamer ducks quite flightless like the rhea whizzing maniacally through the waves chasing a fishing-boat 
They may not be able to fly and one does n't like to enquire too deeply into how elegant they look below the waterline but steamer ducks their wings gyrating through the water like paddle-wheels can make 12 knots and more in a following wind  There were another 100 miles of flatland of dust sheep rheas and distant mountains before we were stopped at a police post 
A trio of grumpy officers all Pinochet look-alikes demanded our passports eyeing us curiously lest we be Argentine spies  We then passed beneath a ranch fence Parque Nacional Torres del Paine it announced and in the distance over a range of low brown grasslands were the sharp spires of a dozen oddly-shaped mountains twisted and contorted and coloured like no other mountains we had ever seen before 
This at last was the place where the engine work of the world was on view just beyond the brow of the hills ahead  It is worthwhile perhaps placing these Towers in the context of their geology 
As I mentioned previously there are six major plates covering the surface of this planet and ten or so that are classified as minor though even minor plates can be as big as entire continents  These plates float relatively coldly and stiffly on the warmer and more mobile outer surface of the earth 's mantle 
They slip and slide against each other somewhat ponderously since they proceed at no more than a foot a year and sometimes a great deal less  But they are for ever moving and where they meet in head-on collision in what is known as a subduction zone they produce one of the great geological dramas of the planet 
Generally speaking a subduction zone is the place where the major business of the earth 's surface is done  One of the colliding plates crumples upwards and then grinds down sliding beneath the onrush of the other 
As it descends towards the mantle it melts thousands of deep-focus earthquakes are triggered as gobbets of molten rock screech and burst against each other the edge of the upper plate meanwhile contorts and rises tortured into the air producing a range of soaring peaks  There are volcanoes and fault lines and a ceaseless tremor of activity 
The ocean floor is scored and fissured and a suture line miles deep plunges through it in sudden counterpoint to the nearby mountain-building  From the deepest point of a new trench to the highest point of a newly created mountain range can be ten miles maybe more the greatest difference in the shape of the planetary spheroid anywhere 
The whole area a band 50 miles wide and hundreds or maybe thousands of miles long is alive rearing and plunging writhing and creaking as the future shape of a portion of the world is determined for the next aeon of geologic time  Geophysicists are perhaps not best known for their romantic souls and when they invented the dire appellation subduction zone they probably overlooked the fact that precisely because of all this subterranean frenzy each one is an area of quite extraordinary beauty 
The contorted peaks of the Torres del Paine rise at the very site of collision of two of the world 's largest plates the South American and the Antarctican Plates  Where they smash into each other at fully one resounding inch a year in one of the primal dramas of the earth 's creation they form the summits and the valleys that even now were beginning to fill our windscreen as we headed deep into the park 
A shepherd a gaucho rode past us ahead of a sea of sheep  There must have been 5,000 head corralled into convoy formation by a quartet of big black dogs 
The gaucho was a swarthy old man in a red woollen cap and a leather jacket his saddle was a grubby sheepskin and the horse 's nose was bridled with a yellow wool cabeza  He waved at us as we passed and then noticing something gesticulated wildly into the air 
Condor he cried  Condor 
And sure enough gliding effortlessly through the eddies and the down-draughts from the peaks ahead were six mighty Andean condors the biggest birds in the world  Vultur gryphus I had been told was not in as grave danger of extinction as its California cousin 
It was a magnificent vision the mighty black-winged birds their wings fully 10 feet from tasselled tip to tasselled tip rose and fell in the cold wind against a background of the brown earth below them the deep blue sky above them and behind them and nearly circling us all the great grey fortresses of the Andes sheer walls of ice snow and rock nearly two miles high  As the plains became higher and colder so another memorable Andean beast appeared the guanaco country cousin to the llama brother to the vicuÃ±a and the alpaca and properly regarded as a small and humpless camel 
Herds if that is the proper collective for guanacos grazed peacefully on the alpine plants  They stood their ground as we passed few people travel this way and none would ever think of harming one of these gentle creatures 
Moreover as the guide-books say of the guanaco when annoyed they spit  Now we were at 2,000 feet the grasslands and such trees as there had been were below us 
The lakes huddled in the valleys Lakes Grey NordenskÃ¶ld and PehoÃ© were speckled with small icebergs and at the end of Lake Grey we spied the white winding-sheet of a glacier edging its way down from the ice-cap  The wind was biting 
The peaks the Towers had closed in above us presenting a glowering vaguely terrifying immensity  They cast a shadow a mile wide within which there was just the howl of the gale clouds of dust and the occasional flurry of hail 
A primal place indeed  As we glanced at each other we shuddered with apprehension 
But we had another few hundred feet to manage before we saw our goal  We scrambled up the hillside on the left bank of an enormous river which thundered down a precipitous cascade of rapids into a foaming cauldron raging with wind-whipped mist 
We could barely hear ourselves think  A few blades of grass clung to the otherwise barren slope the gale tugging all the while at their roots 
Swirls of clouds billowed down from the Towers and the glaciers hung vertically suspended like gigantic icicles while flocks of birds scattered and spun before them helpless in the wild turbulence  Finally we breasted the saddle in the lower ridge what in the Welsh mountains and latterly in the Himalayas we would call the cwm 
Darkness was falling  Behind us we could just make out the glimmer of lamplight from the tiny hotel on Lake Pehoe where we should be dining on river trout bife chorizo and good Chilean pinot noir before the night was out 
If that is we survived the cold and managed to avoid being hurled by the wind into that bottomless pit at the base of the waterfall  Already the night air was laying hoar-frost on the rocks and a gleam of thin ice was sparkling on the surfaces of the flatter stones 
It was dark behind but there was sunset ahead  Sunset and the Pacific Ocean 
Now we were huddled against the wall of sheer pale grey rock that soared seamlessly into the sky up into the ice-white clouds above  Ahead of us the land fell away became green then brown then evolved into a crazed fretwork of islands and sea-lochs lakes and strange peaks 
Could that be perhaps the Isla Esperanza and beyond the much larger Hanover Island Isla Jorge Montt and the chunk of rock the Royal Navy who found it once called Cambridge Island but which was now the Isla Diego de Almagro  To the left I fancied though the light might be playing tricks I could see the horns of Cape Pilar the western end of the Magellan Strait and to the right the prouder outlines of Imperial Fortune Mornington Island and the pleasantly ambiguous Isla del Duque de York 
But ahead beyond all this minor geology stood the Pacific Ocean painted blinding gold by the sun but endless and vast and terribly terribly deep  So here at last this point at which I stood was the very place the geophysical start-line at which two of the world 's great geologic plates met 
Ahead of me in the glorious sunset was the level and quite stable monolith of the Antarctican Plate  Behind me in the dark was the similarly undisturbed sheet of crust known as the South American Plate 
They met collided and contorted somewhere deep below some miles ahead of me beneath all that sea and ice and beyond that jumbled mess of islands  Beneath my feet and beside me to my right were the sheer pale grey rocks that were the andesitic relics of all the ancient turbulence and torture which had been and was still being caused by the plates ' gentle turgid but quite inevitable meeting 
This then was one of the great suture lines of the world a place which marked a turning point in the history of the planet  It was too cold to stand and stare and the wind kept buffeting us dangerously each time we tried to gaze across at the Ocean 
So we turned back eastwards instead and hurried down the hill  Above in the dark there was a rumbling from the Towers of Paine the crackling sound of old rock being broken by new ice and the skitter of smaller stones plunging down a crevasse 
We looked back and up and for a moment the Towers ' summits were flecked with gold before the sun slid down behind the unseen horizon and all Chile was plunged into blackness  An overhead broadcaster on the bridge of the frigate Ariadne crackled into life a bell rang twice and then O'Rourke 's voice came through calm modulated precise and unmistakably Irish 
O'Rourke was commonly referred to as the weatherman which he was n't at all  Just picked up an odd-looking customer 
Forty miles out bearing 222  Talbot pressed the reply button 
The skies above us Chief are hotching with odd-looking customers  At least six airlines criss-cross this patch of the Aegean 
NATO planes as you know better than all of us are all around us  And those pesky fighter-bombers and fighters from the pesky Sixth Fleet bloweth where the wind listeth 
Me I think they 're lost half the time  Ah 
But this is a very odd odd-looking lad  O'Rourke 's voice was unruffled as ever unmoved by the less than flattering reference to the Sixth Fleet from which he was on temporary loan 
No trans-Aegean airline uses the flight path this plane is on  There are no NATO planes in this particular sector on my display screen 
And the Americans would have let us know  A very courteous lot Captain 
The Sixth Fleet I mean  True true 
The Sixth Fleet Talbot was aware would have informed him of the presence of any of their aircraft in his vicinity not from courtesy but because regulations demanded it a fact of which O'Rourke was as well aware as he was  O'Rourke was a doughty defender of his home fleet 
That all you have on this lad  No 
Two things  This plane is on a due south-west to north-east course 
I have no record no information of any plane that could be following this course  Secondly I 'm pretty sure it 's a big plane 
We should see in about four minutes his course is on a direct intersection with ours  The size is important Chief 
Lots of big planes around  Not at 43,000 feet sir which is what this one is 
Only a Concorde does that and we know there are no Concordes about  Military job I would guess 
Of unknown origin  A bandit 
Could be  Keep an eye on him 
Talbot looked around and caught the eye of his second-in-command Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder  Van Gelder was short very broad deeply tanned flaxen-haired and seemed to find life a source of constant amusement 
He was smiling now as he approached the captain  Consider it done sir 
The spy-glass and a photo for your family album  That 's it 
Thank you  The Ariadne carried an immense and to the uninitiated quite bewildering variety of looking and listening instruments that may well have been unmatched by any naval ship afloat 
Among those instruments were what Van Gelder had referred to as the spy-glass  This was a combined telescope and camera invented and built by the French of the type used by spy satellites in orbit and which was capable under ideal atmospheric circumstances of locating and photographing a white plate from an altitude of 250 miles 
The focal length of the telescope was almost infinitely adjustable in this case Van Gelder would probably use a one in a hundred resolution which would have the optical effect of bringing the intruder if intruder it was to an apparent altitude of four hundred feet  In the cloudless July skies of the Cyclades this presented no problem at all 
Van Gelder had just left the bridge when another loudspeaker came to life the repeated double buzzer identifying it as the radio-room  The helmsman Leading Seaman Harrison leaned forward and made the appropriate switch 
I have an SOS  I think repeat think vessel 's position is just south of Thera 
All I have  Very garbled certainly not a trained operator 
Just keeps repeating Mayday Mayday Mayday  Myers the radio operator on duty sounded annoyed every radio operator the tone of his voice said should be as expert and efficient as he was 
Wait a minute though  There was a pause then Myers came on again 
Sinking he says  Four times he said he was sinking 
Talbot said That all  That 's all sir 
He 's gone off the air  Well just keep listening on the distress frequency Harrison 090 or near enough 
Ca n't be more than ten twelve miles away  He reached for the engine control and turned it up to full power 
The Ariadne in the modern fashion had dual engine-room and bridge controls  The engine-room had customarily only one rating a leading stoker on watch and this only because custom dictated it not because necessity demanded it 
The lone watchman might just possibly be wandering around with an oil-can in hand but more probably was immersed in one of the lurid magazines with which what was called the engine-room library was so liberally stocked  The Ariadne 's chief engineer Lieutenant McCafferty rarely ventured near his own domain 
A first-class engineer McCafferty claimed he was allergic to diesel fumes and treated with a knowing disdain the frequently repeated observation that because of the engine-room 's highly efficient extractor fans it was virtually impossible for anyone to detect the smell of diesel  He was to be found that afternoon as he was most afternoons seated in a deckchair aft and immersed in his favourite form of relaxation the reading of detective novels heavily laced with romance of the more dubious kind 
The distant sound of the diesels deepened the Ariadne was capable of a very respectable 35 knots and the bridge began to vibrate quite noticeably  Talbot reached for a phone and got through to Van Gelder 
We 've picked up a distress signal  Ten twelve miles away 
Let me know when you locate this bandit and I 'll cut the engines  The spy-glass though splendidly gimballed to deal with the worst vagaries of pitching and rolling was quite incapable of coping with even the mildest vibration which more often than not produced a very fuzzy photograph indeed 
Talbot moved out on to the port wing to join the lieutenant who stood there a tall thin young man with fair hair thick pebbled glasses and a permanently lugubrious expression  Well Jimmy how do you fancy this 
A maybe bandit and a sinking vessel at the same time  Should relieve the tedium of a long hot summer 's afternoon do n't you think 
The lieutenant looked at him without enthusiasm  Lieutenant the Lord James Denholm Talbot called him Jimmy for brevity 's sake seldom waxed enthusiastic about anything 
I do n't fancy it at all Captain  Denholm waved a languid hand 
Disturbs the even tenor of my ways  Talbot smiled 
Denholm was surrounded by an almost palpable aura of aristocratic exhaustion that had disturbed and irritated Talbot in the early stage of their acquaintanceship a feeling that had lasted for no more than half an hour  Denholm was totally unfitted to be a naval officer of any kind and his highly defective eyesight should have led to his automatic disbarment from any navy in the world 
But Denholm was aboard the Ariadne not because of his many connections with the highest echelons of society heir to an earldom his blood was indisputably the bluest of the blue but because without question he was the right man in the right place  The holder of three scientific degrees from Oxford UCLA and MIT all summa cum laude in electrical engineering and electronics Denholm was as close to being an electronics wizard as any man could ever hope to be 
Not that Denholm would have claimed to be anything of what he would have said to be the ridiculous kind  Despite his lineage and academic qualifications Denholm was modest and retiring to a fault 
This reticence extended even to the making of protests which was why despite his feeble objections he had been under no compulsion to go he had been dragooned into the Navy in the first place  He said to Talbot This bandit Captain if it is a bandit what do you intend to do about it 
I do n't intend to do anything about it  But if he is a bandit well then he 's spying is n't he 
Of course  Well then 
What do you expect me to do Jimmy  Bring him down 
Or are you itching to try out this experimental laser gun you have with you  Heaven forfend 
Denholm was genuinely horrified  I 've never fired a gun in anger in my life 
Correction  I 've never even fired a gun 
If I wanted to bring him down a teeny-weeny heat-seeking missile would do the job very effectively  But we do n't do things like that 
We 're civilized  Besides we do n't provoke international incidents 
An unwritten law  Sounds a very funny law to me 
Not at all  When the United States or NATO play war games as we are doing now the Soviets track us very closely indeed whether on land sea or air 
We do n't complain  We ca n't 
When they 're playing their game we do exactly the same to them  Can admittedly have its awkward moments 
Not so long ago when the US Navy were carrying out exercises in the Sea of Japan an American destroyer banged into and quite severely damaged a Russian submarine which was monitoring things a little too closely  And that did n't cause what you 've just called an international incident 
Certainly not  Nobody 's fault 
Mutual apologies between the two captains and the Russian was towed to a safe port by another Russian warship  Vladivostok I believe it was 
Talbot turned his head  Excuse me 
That 's the radio-room call-up  Myers again the speaker said 
Delos  Name of the sinking vessel 
Very brief message explosion on fire sinking fast  Keep listening Talbot said 
He looked at the helmsman who already had a pair of binoculars to his eyes  You have it Harrison 
Yes sir  Harrison handed over the binoculars and twitched the wheel to port 
Fire off the port bow  Talbot picked it up immediately a thin black column of smoke rising vertically unwaveringly into the blue and windless sky 
He was just lowering his glasses when the bell rang twice again  It was O'Rourke the weatherman or more officially the senior long-range radar operator 
Lost him I 'm afraid  The bandit I mean 
I was looking at the vectors on either side of him to see if he had any friends and when I came back he was gone  Any ideas Chief 
Well  O'Rourke sounded doubtful 
He could have exploded but I doubt it  So do I. We 've had the spy-glass trained on his approach bearing and they 'd have picked up an explosion for sure 
Then he must have gone into a steep dive  A very steep dive 
God knows why  I 'll find him 
The speaker clicked off  Almost at once a telephone rang again 
It was Van Gelder  222 sir 
Smoke  Plane 
Could be the bandit  Almost certainly is 
The weatherman 's just lost it off the long-range radar screen  Probably a waste of time but try to get that photograph anyway 
He moved out on to the starboard wing and trained his glasses over the starboard quarter  He picked it up immediately a heavy dark plume of smoke with he thought a glow of red at its centre 
It was still quite high at an altitude of four or five thousand feet  He did n't pause to check how deeply the plane was diving or whether or not it actually was on fire 
He moved quickly back into the bridge and picked up a phone  Sub-Lieutenant Cousteau 
Quickly  A brief pause 
Henri  Captain 
Emergency  Have the launch and the lifeboat slung outboard 
Crews to stand by to lower  Then report to the bridge 
He rang down to the engine-room for Slow Ahead then said to Harrison Hard a-port  Steer north 
Denholm who had moved out on to the starboard wing returned lowering his binoculars  Well even I can see that plane 
Not a plane rather a huge streamer of smoke  Could that have been the bandit sir if it was a bandit 
Must have been  Denholm said tentatively I do n't care much for his line of approach sir 
I do n't care much for it myself Lieutenant especially if it 's a military plane and even more especially if it 's carrying bombs of any sort  If you look you 'll see that we 're getting out of its way 
Ah  Evasive action 
Denholm hesitated then said doubtfully Well as long as he does n't alter course  Dead men do n't alter courses 
That they do n't  Van Gelder had just returned to the bridge 
And the man or the men behind the controls of that plane are surely dead  No point in my staying there sir Gibson 's better with the spy-glass camera than I am and he 's very busy with it 
We 'll have plenty of photographs to show you but I doubt whether we 'll be able to learn very much from them  As bad as that 
You were n't able to establish anything  Very little I 'm afraid 
I did see the outer engine on the port wing  So it 's a four-engined jet 
Civil or military I 've no idea  A moment please 
Talbot moved out on the port wing looked aft saw that the blazing plane there was no mistaking the flames now was due astern at less than half the height and distance than when he had first seen it returned to the bridge told Harrison to steer due north then turned again to Van Gelder  That was all you could establish 
About  Except that the fire is definitely located in the nose cone which would rule out any engine explosion 
It could n't have been hit by a missile because we know there are no missile-carrying planes around even if there were a heat-seeking missile the only type that could nail it at that altitude would have gone for the engines not the nose cone  It could only have been an up-front internal explosion 
Talbot nodded reached for a phone asked the exchange for the sick bay and was through immediately  Doctor 
Would you detail an SBA with first-aid kit to stand by the lifeboat  He paused for a moment 
Sorry no time to explain  Come on up to the bridge 
He looked aft through the starboard wing doorway turned and took the wheel from the helmsman  Take a look Harrison 
A good look  Harrison moved out on the starboard wing had his good look it took him only a few seconds returned and took the wheel again 
Awful  He shook his head 
They 're finished sir are n't they  So I would have thought 
They 're going to miss us by at least a quarter mile  Maybe a half 
Harrison took another quick look through the doorway  This angle of descent they should land rather hit the sea a mile mile and a half ahead 
Unless by some fluke they carry on and hit the island  That would be curtains sir 
It would indeed  Talbot looked ahead through the for'ard screens 
Thera Island was some four miles distant with Cape Akrotiri lying directly to the north and Mount Elias the highest point of the island it was close on 2000 feet to the north-east  Between them but about five miles further distant a tenuous column of bluish smoke hardly visible against a cloudless sky hung lazily in the air 
This marked the site of Thira Village the only settlement of any size on the island  But the damage would be limited to the plane 
The south-west of the island is barren  I do n't think anyone lives there 
What are we going to do sir  Stop over the point where it goes down 
Something like that  You can handle it yourself 
Or maybe another quarter or half mile further on along the line he was taking  Have to wait and see 
Fact is Harrison I know no more about it than you do  It may disintegrate on impact or if it survives that it may carry on some distance under water 
Not for far I should think not if its nose has gone  Number One this to Van Gelder what depths do we have here 
I know the five fathom mark is about half a mile offshore along the south of the island  Beyond that it shelves pretty steeply 
I 'll have to check in the chart-room  At the moment I 'd guess we 're in two to three hundred fathoms 
A sonar check sir  Please 
Van Gelder left brushing by Sub-Lieutenant Cousteau as he did  Cousteau barely in his twenties was a happy-go-lucky youngster always eager and willing and a more than competent seaman 
Talbot beckoned him out on to the starboard wing  Have you seen it Henri 
Yes sir  Cousteau 's normal cheerfulness was in marked abeyance 
He gazed in unwilling fascination at the blazing smoking plane now directly abeam and at an altitude of under a thousand feet  What a damnable awful thing 
Aye it 's not nice  They had been joined by Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander Andrew Grierson 
Grierson was dressed in white shorts and a flowing multi-coloured Hawaiian shirt which he doubtless regarded as the correct dress of the day for the summer Aegean  So this is why you wanted Moss and his first-aid box 
Moss was the Leading Sick Bay Attendant  I 'm thinking maybe I should be going myself 
Grierson was a West Highland Scot as was immediately evident from his accent an accent which he never attempted to conceal for the excellent reason that he saw no earthly reason why he ever should  If there are any survivors which I consider bloody unlikely I know something about decompression problems which Moss does n't 
Talbot was conscious of the increased vibration beneath his feet  Harrison had increased speed and was edging a little to the east 
Talbot did n't even give it a second thought his faith in his senior quartermaster was complete  Sorry Doctor but I have more important things for you to do 
He pointed to the east  Look under the trail of smoke to the plane 's left 
I see it  I should have seen it before 
Somebody sinking for a fiver  Indeed 
Something called the Delos a private yacht I should imagine and as you say sinking  Explosion and on fire 
Pretty heavily on fire too I would think  Burns injuries 
We live in troubled times Grierson said  Grierson in fact lived a singularly carefree and untroubled existence but Talbot thought it was hardly the time to point this out to him 
The plane 's silent sir Cousteau said  The engines have been shut off 
Survivors you think  I 'm afraid not 
The explosion may have destroyed the controls in which case I imagine the engines shut off automatically  Disintegrate or dive 
Grierson said  Daft question 
We 'll know all too soon  Van Gelder joined them 
I make it eighty fathoms here sir  Sonar says seventy 
They 're probably right  Does n't matter it 's shallowing anyway 
Talbot nodded and said nothing  Nobody said anything nobody felt like saying anything 
The plane or the source of the dense column of smoke was now less than a hundred feet above the water  Suddenly the source of the smoke and flame dipped and then was abruptly extinguished 
Even then they failed to catch a glimpse of the plane it had been immediately engulfed in a fifty-foot-high curtain of water and spray  There was no sound of impact and certainly no disintegration for when the water and the spray cleared away there was only the empty sea and curiously small waves little more than ripples radiating outwards from the point of impact 
Talbot touched Cousteau on the arm  Your cue Henri 
How 's the whaler 's radio  Tested yesterday sir 
Okay  If you find anything anybody let us know 
I have a feeling you wo n't need that radio  When we stop lower away then keep circling around 
We should be back in half an hour or so  Cousteau left and Talbot turned to Van Gelder 
When we stop tell sonar I want the exact depth  Five minutes later the whaler was in the water and moving away from the side of the Ariadne 
Talbot rang for full power and headed east  Van Gelder hung up a phone 
Thirty fathoms sonar says  Give or take a fathom 
Thanks  Doctor 
Hundred and eighty feet Grierson said  I do n't even have to rub my chin over that one 
The answer is no  Even if anyone could escape from the fuselage which I think would be impossible in the first place they 'd die soon after surfacing 
Diver 's bends  Burst lungs 
They would n't know that they 'd have to breathe out all the way up  A trained fit submariner possibly with breathing apparatus might do it 
There would be no fit trained submariners aboard that plane  Question 's academic anyway 
I agree with you Captain  The only men aboard that plane are dead men 
Talbot nodded and reached for a phone  Myers 
Signal to General Carson  Unidentified four-engined plane crashed in sea two miles south of Cape Akrotiri Thera Island 
1415 hours  Impossible to determine whether military or civilian 
First located altitude 43,000 feet  Apparent cause internal explosion 
No further details available at present  No NATO planes reported in vicinity 
Have you any information  Sylvester 
Send Code B.  Wilco sir 
Where do I send it  Rome 
Wherever he is he 'll have it two minutes later  Grierson said Well yes if anyone knows he should 
Carson was the C-in-C Southern European NATO  He lifted his binoculars and looked at the vertical column of smoke now no more than four miles to the east 
A yacht as you say and making quite a bonfire  If there 's anyone still aboard they 're going to be very warm indeed 
Are you going alongside Captain  Alongside 
Talbot looked at Denholm  What 's your estimate of the value of the electronic gear we have aboard 
Twenty million  Maybe twenty-five 
A lot anyway  'There 's your answer Doctor 
That thing 's gone bang once already  It can go bang once again 
I am not going alongside  You are 
In the launch  That 's expendable 
The Ariadne 's not  Well thank you very much 
And what intrepid soul  I 'm sure Number One here will be delighted to ferry you across 
Ah  Number One have your men wear overalls gloves and flash-masks 
Injuries from burning diesel can be very unpleasant indeed  And you 
I go to prepare myself for self-immolation  And do n't forget your lifebelts 
Grierson did n't deign to answer  They had halved the remaining distance to the burning yacht when Talbot got through to the radio-room again 
Message dispatched  Dispatched and acknowledged 
Anything more from the Delos  Nothing 
Delos Denholm said  That 's about eighty miles north of here 
Alas the Cyclades will never be the same for me again  Denholm sighed 
Electronics specialist or not he regarded himself primarily as a classicist andâ€“ indeed he was totally fluent in reading and writing both Latin and Greek  He was deeply immersed in their ancient cultures as the considerable library in his cabin bore testimony 
He was also much given to quotations and he quoted now  'The isles of Greece the isles of Greece 
Where burning Sappho loved and sung  Where grew the arts of war and peace 
Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung  Eternal summer 
Your point is taken Lieutenant Talbot said  We 'll cry tomorrow 
In the meantime let us address ourselves to the problem of those poor souls on the fo'c's'le  I count five of them 
So do I. Denholm lowered his glasses  What 's all the frantic waving for 
Surely to God they ca n't imagine we have n't seen them  They 've seen us all right 
Relief Lieutenant  Expectation of rescue 
But there 's more to it than that  A certain urgency in their waving 
A primitive form of semaphoring  What they 're saying is get us the hell out of here and be quick about it 
Maybe they 're expecting another explosion  Could be that 
Harrison I want to come to a stop on their starboard beam  At you understand a prudent distance 
A hundred yards sir  Fine 
The Delos was or had been a rather splendid yacht  A streamlined eighty-footer it was obvious that it had been until very very recently a dazzling white 
Now because of a combination of smoke and diesel oil it was mainly black  A rather elaborate superstructure consisted of a bridge saloon a dining-room and what may or may not have been a galley 
The still dense smoke and flames rising six feet above the poop deck indicated the source of the fire almost certainly the engine-room  Just aft of the fire a small motorboat was still secured to its davits it was n't difficult to guess that either the explosion or the fire had rendered it inoperable 
Talbot said Rather odd do n't you think Lieutenant  Odd 
Denholm said carefully  Yes 
You can see that the flames are dying away  One would have thought that would reduce the danger of further explosion 
Talbot moved out on the port wing  And you will have observed that the water level is almost up to the deck 
I can see she 's sinking  Indeed 
If you were aboard a vessel that was either going to go up or drag you down when it sank what would your natural reaction be  To be elsewhere sir 
But I can see that their motorboat has been damaged  Agreed 
But a craft that size would carry alternative life-saving equipment  If not a Carley float then certainly an inflatable rubber dinghy 
And any prudent owner would carry a sufficiency of lifebelts and life-jackets for the passengers and crew  I can even see two lifebelts in front of the bridge 
But they have n't done the obvious thing and abandoned ship  I wonder why 
I 've no idea sir  But it is damned odd 
When we 've rescued those distressed mariners and brought them aboard you Jimmy will have forgotten how to speak Greek  But I will not have forgotten how to listen in Greek 
Precisely  Commander Talbot you have a devious and suspicious mind 
It goes with the job Jimmy  It goes with the job 
Harrison brought the Ariadne to a stop off the starboard beam of the Delos at the agreed hundred yards distance  Van Gelder was away at once and was very quickly alongside the fo'c's'le of the Delos 
Two boat-hooks around the guard-rail stanchions held them in position  As the launch and the bows of the sinking yacht were now almost level it took only a few seconds to transfer the six survivors another had joined the group of five that Talbot had seen aboard the launch 
They were indeed a sorry and sadly bedraggled lot so covered in diesel and smoke that it was quite impossible to discriminate among them on the basis of age sex or nationality  Van Gelder said Any of you here speak English 
We all do  The speaker was short and stocky and that was all that could be said of him in the way of description 
Some of us just a little  But enough 
The voice was heavily accented but readily understood  Van Gelder looked at Grierson 
Any of you injured any of you burnt  Grierson said 
All shook their heads or mumbled a negative  Nothing here for me Number One 
Hot showers detergents soap  Not to mention a change of clothing 
Who 's in charge here  Van Gelder asked 
I am  It was the same man 
Anybody left aboard  Three men I 'm afraid 
They wo n't be coming with us  You mean they 're dead 
The man nodded  I 'll check 
No no  His oil-soaked hand gripped Van Gelder 's arm 
It is too dangerous far too dangerous  I forbid it 
You forbid me nothing  When Van Gelder was n't smiling which was n't often he could assume a very discouraging expression indeed 
The man withdrew his hand  Where are those men 
In the passageway between the engine-room and the stateroom aft  We got them out after the explosion but before the fire began 
Riley  This to a Leading Seaman 
Come aboard with me  If you think the yacht 's going give me a call 
He picked up a torch and was about to board the Delos when a hand holding a pair of goggles reached out and stopped him  Van Gelder smiled 
Thank you Doctor  I had n't thought of that 
Once aboard he made his way aft and descended the after companionway  There was smoke down there but not too much and with the aid of his torch he had no difficulty in locating the three missing men all huddled shapelessly in a corner 
To his right was the engine-room door slightly buckled from the force of the explosion  Not without some difficulty he forced the door open and at once began coughing as the foul-smelling smoke caught his throat and eyes 
He pulled on the goggles but still there was nothing to see except for the red embers of a dying fire emanating from some unknown source  He pulled the door to behind him he was reasonably certain there was nothing for him to see in the engine-room anyway and stooped to examine the three dead men 
They were far from being a pretty sight but he forced himself to carry out as thorough an investigation as he could  He spent some quite considerable time bent over long time and when he straightened he looked both puzzled and thoughtful 
The door to the after stateroom opened easily  There was some smoke there but not so much that he required to use his goggles 
The cabin was luxuriously furnished and immaculately tidy a condition which Van Gelder very rapidly altered  He pulled a sheet from one of the beds spread it on the floor opened up wardrobes and drawers scooped up armfuls of clothes there was no time to make any kind of selection and even if there had been he would have been unable to pick and choose they were all women 's clothing dumped them on the sheet tied up the four corners lugged the bundle up the companionway and handed it over to Riley 
Put this in the launch  I 'm going to have a quick look at the for'ard cabins 
I think the steps will be at the for'ard end of the saloon under the bridge  I think you should hurry sir 
Van Gelder did n't answer  He did n't have to be told why he should hurry the sea was already beginning to trickle over on to the upper deck 
He passed into the saloon found the companionway at once and descended to a central passage  He switched on his torch there was of course no electrical power left 
There were doors on both sides and one at the end  The first door to port opened up into a food store the corresponding door to starboard was locked 
Van Gelder did n't bother with it the Delos did n't look like the kind of craft that would lack a commodious liquor store  Behind the other doors lay four cabins and two bathrooms 
All were empty  As he had done before Van Gelder spread out a sheet in the passageway this time threw some more armfuls of clothes on to it secured the corners and hurried up on deck 
The launch was no more than thirty yards away when the Delos still on even keel slid gently under the surface of the sea  There was nothing dramatic to mark its going just a stream of air bubbles that became gradually smaller and ceased altogether after about twenty seconds 
Talbot was on deck when the launch brought back the six survivors  He looked in concern at the woebegone and bedraggled figures before him 
My goodness what a state you people are in. l his the lot Number One  Those that survived sir 
Three died  Impossible to get their bodies out in time 
He indicated the figure nearest him  This is the owner 
Andropulos the man said  Spyros Andropulos 
You are the officer in charge  Commander Talbot 
My commiserations Mr Andropulos  And my thanks Commander 
We are very deeply grateful  With respect sir that can wait 
First things first and the very first thing is to get yourselves cleaned up immediately  Ah 
And changed  A problem 
Clothes  We 'll find some 
Clothing we have Van Gelder said  He pointed at the two sheet-wrapped packages 
Ladies  Gentlemen 
A mention in dispatches for that Number One  You said ladies 
Two Commander Andropulos said  He looked at the two people standing by him 
My niece and her friend  Ah 
Well should apologize I suppose but difficult to tell in the circumstances  My name is Charial 
The voice was unmistakably feminine  Irene Charial 
This is my friend Eugenia  We could have met under happier circumstances 
Lieutenant Denholm here will take you to my cabin  The bathroom is small but adequate 
By the time you bring them back Lieutenant I trust they are recognizable for what they are  He turned to a burly dark-haired figure who like most of the crew wore no insignia of rank 
Chief Petty Officer McKenzie  McKenzie was the senior NCO on the Ariadne 
The four gentlemen here Chief  You know what to do 
Right away sir  If you will come with me gentlemen 
Grierson also left and Van Gelder and Talbot were left alone  We can find this place again 
Van Gelder asked  No trouble 
Talbot looked at him speculatively and pointed towards the north-west  I 've taken a bearing on the monastery and radar station on Mount Elias there 
Sonar says that we 're in eighteen fathoms  Just to make sure we 'll drop a marker buoy 
General Carson laid down the slip of paper he had been studying and looked at the colonel seated across the table from him  What do you make of this Charles 
Could be nothing  Could be important 
Sorry that does n't help  I have a feeling I do n't like it 
It would help a bit if we had a sailor around  Carson smiled and pressed a button 
Do you know if Vice-Admiral Hawkins is in the building  He is sir 
A girl 's voice  Do you wish to speak to him or see him 
See him Jean  Ask him if he would be kind enough to stop by 
Vice-Admiral Hawkins was very young for one of his rank  He was short a little overweight more than a little rubicund as to his features and exuded an aura of cheerful bonhomie 
He did n't look very bright which he was  He was widely regarded as having one of the most brilliant minds in the Royal Navy 
He took the seat to which Carson had gestured him and glanced at the message slip  I see I see 
He laid the message down  But you did n't ask me here to comment on a perfectly straightforward signal 
The Sylvester is one of the code names for the frigate HMS Ariadne  One of the vessels under your command sir 
Do n't rub it in David  I know it of course more accurately I know of it 
Do n't forget I 'm just a simple landlubber  Odd name is n't it 
Royal Naval ship with a Greek name  Courtesy gesture to the Greeks sir 
We 're carrying out a joint hydrographic survey with them  Is that so 
General Carson ran a hand through his grizzled hair  I was not aware that I was in the hydrographic business David 
You 're not sir although I have no doubt it could carry out such a survey if it were called for  The Ariadne has a radio system that can transmit to and receive transmissions from any quarter of the globe 
It has telescopes and optical instruments that can pick out the salient features of say any passing satellite even those in geosynchronous orbit and that 's 22,000 miles up  It carries long-range and surface radar that is as advanced as any in the world 
And it has a sonar location and detection system that can pick up a sunken object at the bottom of the ocean just as easily as it can pinpoint a lurking submarine  The Ariadne sir is the eyes and the ears and the voice of your fleet 
That 's nice to know I must say  Very reassuring 
The ability of the commanding officer of the Ariadne is ah commensurate with this extraordinary array of devices he controls  Indeed sir 
For an exceptionally complex task an exceptionally qualified man  Commander Talbot is an outstanding officer 
Hand-picked for the job  'Who picked him 
I did  I see 
That terminates this line of conversation very abruptly  Carson pondered briefly 
I think Colonel that we should ask General Simpson about this one  Simpson the over-all commander of NATO was the only man who outranked Carson in Europe 
Do n't see what else we can do sir  You would agree David 
No General  I think you 'd be wasting your time 
If you do n't know anything about this then I 'm damned sure General Simpson does n't know anything either  This is not an educated guess call it a completely uneducated guess but I have an odd feeling that this is one of your planes sir an American plane 
A bomber almost certainly perhaps not yet off the secret lists it was after all flying at an uncommon height  The Ariadne could have been in error 
The Ariadne does not make mistakes  My job and my life on it 
The flat unemotional voice carried complete conviction  Commander Talbot is not the only uniquely qualified man aboard 
There are at least thirty others in the same category  We have for example an electronics officer so unbelievably advanced in his speciality that none of your much-vaunted high-technology whizzkids in Silicon Valley would even begin to know what he 's talking about 
Carson raised a hand  Point taken David point taken 
So an American bomber  A very special bomber because it must be carrying a very special cargo 
What would you guess that to be  Hawkins smiled faintly 
I am not yet in the ESP business sir  People or goods 
Very secret very important goods or very secret and very important people  There 's only one source that can give you the answer and it might be pointed our that their refusal to divulge this information might put the whole future of NATO at risk and that the individual ultimately responsible for the negative decision would be answerable directly to the president of the United States 
One does not imagine that the individual concerned would remain in a position of responsibility for very much longer  Carson sighed 
If I may speak in a spirit of complaint David I might point out that it 's easy for you to talk and even easier to talk tough  You 're a British officer 
I 'm an American  I appreciate that sir 
Carson looked at the colonel who remained silent for a couple of moments then nodded slowly twice  Carson reached for the button on his desk 
Jean  Sir 
Get me the Pentagon  Immediately 
You are unhappy Vincent  Vincent was Van Gelder 's first name 
There were three of them seated in the wardroom Talbot Van Gelder and Grierson  Puzzled you might say sir 
I do n't understand why Andropulos and the others did n't abandon ship earlier  I saw two inflatable dinghies aboard 
Rolled up admittedly but those things can be opened and inflated from their gas cylinders in seconds  There were also lifebelts and life-jackets 
There was no need for this the-boy-stood-on-the-burning-deck act  They could have left at any time 
I 'm not saying they 'd have been sucked down with the yacht but they might have had a rather uncomfortable time  Same thought had occurred to me 
Mentioned it to Andrew here  Odd 
Maybe Andropulos had a reason  Anything else 
The owner tried to stop me from boarding the yacht  Maybe he was concerned with my health 
I have the feeling he was n't  Then I would much like to know what caused that explosion in the engine-room 
A luxurious yacht like that must have carried an engineer we can find that out easily enough and it 's a fair guess that the engines would have been maintained in an immaculate condition  I do n't see how they could have caused an explosion 
We 'll have to ask McCafferty about that one  That of course is why you were so anxious that we pinpoint the spot where the Delos went down 
You think an expert on the effects of explosives could identify and locate the cause of the explosion  I 'm sure he could especially if he were an expert at determining the causes of aircraft lost through explosions those people are much better at that sort of thing than the Navy is 
Explosives experts we have aboard but no experts on the effects of explosives  Even if we did we have no divers aboard well you and myself apart trained to work at levels below a hundred feet 
We could borrow one easily enough from a lifting vessel or salvage tug but the chances are high that he 'd know nothing about explosives  But there 's really no problem 
It would be a simple matter for any lifting vessel to raise an aircraft fuselage to the surface  Talbot regarded Van Gelder thoughtfully 
But there 's something else worrying you is n't there  Yes sir 
The three dead men aboard the Delos well to be specific just one of them  That 's why I asked the doctor here to come along 
The three of them were so smoke begrimed and blackened that it was difficult to tell what they were wearing but two of them appeared to be dressed in white while the third was in a navy blue overall  An engineer would n't wear whites 
Well I admit our engineer Lieutenant McCafferty is a dazzling exception but he 's a one-off case he never goes near his engines anyway  In any event I assumed the man in the overalls was the engineer and he was the one who caught my attention 
He had a vicious gash on the back of his head as if he had been blown backwards against a very hard very sharp object  Grierson said Or been struck by a very hard sharp object 
Either way I suppose  I would n't know 
I 'm afraid I 'm a bit weak on the forensic side  Had his occiput been crushed 
Back of his head  No 
At least I 'm reasonably certain it had n't been  I mean it would have given would n't it or been squashy 
It was n't like that  A blow like that should have caused massive bruising 
Did you see any  Difficult to say 
He had fairly thick hair  But it was fair 
No I do n't think there was any  Had it bled a lot 
He had n't bled at all  I 'm quite sure of that 
You did n't notice any holes in his clothing  Not that I could see 
He had n't been shot if that is what you 're asking and that is what I think you are asking  Who would want to shoot a dead man 
His neck was broken  Indeed 
Grierson seemed unsurprised  Poor man was through the wars was n't he 
Talbot said What do you think Andrew  I do n't know what to think 
The inflicting of the wound on the head and the snapping of the vertebra could well have been simultaneous  If the two were n't simultaneous then it could equally well have been as Vincent clearly seems to think a case of murder 
Would an examination of the corpse help at all  It might 
I very much doubt it  But an examination of engine-room bulkheads would 
To see if there were any sharp edges or protrusions that could have caused such a head wound  Grierson nodded 
Well when and if we ever raise that hull we should be able to kill two birds with one stone to determine the causes of both the explosions and this man 's death  Maybe three birds Van Gelder said 
It would be interesting to know the number and layout of the fuel tanks in the engine-room  There are I believe two common layouts in one case there is just one main fuel tank athwartships and attached to the for'ard bulkhead with a generator or generators on one side of the engine and batteries on the other plus a water-tank to port and another to starboard or there could be a fuel tank on either side with the water-tank up front 
In that case the two fuel tanks are interconnected to keep the fuel levels equal and maintain equilibrium  A suspicious mind Number One Talbot said 
Very suspicious  What you would like to find of course is just one fuel tank because you think Andropulos is going to claim that he did n't abandon ship because he thought another fuel tank was about to go and he did n't want his precious passengers splashing about in a sea of blazing fuel oil which would of course also have destroyed the rubber dinghies 
I 'm grieved sir  I thought I 'd thought of that first 
You did in fact  When the passengers are cleaned up see if you can get this young lady Irene Charial alone and find out if she knows anything about the layout of the engine-room 
The casual approach Vincent the innocent and cherubic expression although I doubt the last is beyond you  Anyway it 's possible she 's never been there and may possibly know nothing about it 
It 's equally possible sir that she knows all about it and may well choose to tell me something  Miss Charial is Andropulos 's niece 
The thought had occurred  However if Andropulos is not all he might be then the chances are high that there is some other member of his ship 's company in his confidence and I would have thought that would be a man 
I do n't say that that 's because you know what the Greeks are like because I do n't know what the Greeks are like  And we must n't forget that Andropulos may be as innocent as the driven snow and that there is a perfectly rational explanation for all that has happened 
Anyway it would do no harm to try and you never can tell Vincent she might turn out to be a classic Greek beauty  From the fact that the whaler was lying stopped in the water and that Cousteau his hand resting idly on the tiller appeared to be expressing no great degree of interest in anything it was obvious that his wait had been a vain one a fact he confirmed on his arrival on the bridge 
Talbot called the sonar room  You have pinpointed the location of the plane 
Yes sir  We 're sitting exactly above it 
Depth registered is eighteen fathoms  That 's the echo from the top of the fuselage 
Probably lying in about twenty fathoms  It 's lying in the same direction as it was flying when it came down north-east to south-west 
Picking up some rather odd noises down here sir  Would you care to come down 
Yes I will  For reasons best known to himself Halzman the senior sonar operator preferred not to discuss it over an open line 
A minute or two  He turned to Van Gelder 
Have McKenzie put down a marker buoy about midships  Tell him to lower the weight gently 
I do n't want to bump too hard against the plane 's fuselage in case we do actually come into contact with it  When that 's been done I want to anchor 
Two anchors  A stern anchor to the north-west about a hundred yards distant from the buoy then a bow anchor a similar distance to the south-east 
Yes sir  May I suggest the other way around 
Of course you 're right  I 'd forgotten about our old friend 
Taking a holiday today is n't it  The other way around of course 
The old friend to which he referred and which Van Gelder clearly had in mind was the Meltemi wind referred to as the Etesian in the British sailing directions  In the Cyclades in the summer months and indeed in most of the Aegean it blew steadily but usually only in the afternoon and early evening from the north-west 
If it did start up the Ariadne would ride more comfortably if it were bows on to it  Talbot went to the sonar room which was only one deck down and slightly aft 
The sonar room was heavily insulated against all outside noise and dimly lit by subdued yellow lighting  There were three display screens two sets of control panels and over and above all a considerable number of heavily padded earphones 
Halzman caught sight of him in an overhead mirror there were a number of such mirrors around speaking as well as any other kind of sound was kept to a minimum in the sonar room removed his earphones and gestured to the seat beside him  Those earphones sir 
I thought you might be interested in listening for a minute  Talbot sat and clamped the earphones on 
After about fifteen seconds he removed-them and turned to Halzman who had also removed his  I ca n't hear a damned thing 
With respect sir when I said a minute I meant just that  A minute 
First of all you have to listen until you hear the silence then you 'll hear it  Whatever that means I 'll try it 
Talbot listened again and just before the allotted minute was up he leaned forward and creased his brow  After another thirty seconds he removed the head-set 
A ticking sound  Strange Halzman you were right 
First you hear the silence and then you hear it  Tick tick tick once every two to three seconds 
Very regular  Very faint 
You 're certain that comes from the plane  I have no doubt sir 
Have you ever heard anything like it before  No sir 
I 've spent hundreds of hours more likely thousands listening to sonar asdics hydrophones but this is something quite new on me  I 've got pretty good hearing but I had to wait almost a moment before I could imagine I could hear anything 
It 's very very faint is n't it  It is 
I had to turn the hearing capacity up to maximum before I stumbled on it not a practice I would normally follow or recommend in the wrong circumstances you can get your eardrums blasted off  Why is it so faint 
Well the source of the sound may be very faint to begin with  I 've been thinking about this sir well I 've had nothing else to think about 
It 's either a mechanical or electrical device  In either case it has to be inside a sealed or waterproof casing 
A mechanical device could of course operate in water even if it was totally submerged but operating in water would dampen out the sound almost completely  An electrical device would have to be totally sealed against sea-water 
The plane 's own electrical system of course has ceased to function so it would have to have its own supply system almost certainly battery-powered  In either event mechanical or electrical the sound impulses would have to pass through the waterproof casing after which they must pass through the fuselage of the plane 
Have you any idea as to what it might be  None whatsoever 
It 's a two and a half second sequence I 've timed it  I know of no watch or clock movement that follows that sequence 
Do you sir  No I do n't 
You think it could be some sort of timing device  I thought about that too sir but I put it out of my mind 
Halzman smiled  Maybe I 'm prejudiced against that idea because of all those cheap and awful video film cassettes we have aboard with all their special effects and pseudo science 
All I know for sure sir is that we have a mysterious plane lying on the sea-bed there  Lord only knows what mysterious kind of cargo it was carrying 
Agreed  I think we 'd better leave it at that for the moment 
Have one of your boys monitor it once say in every fifteen minutes  When Talbot returned to the bridge he could see the marker buoy just astern bobbing gently in the very small wake Van Gelder was creating as he edged the Ariadne gently to the north-west 
Very soon he stopped juggled the engines to and fro until he reckoned the bows were a hundred yards distant from the buoy had the anchor dropped then moved just as slowly astern the anchor chain being paid out as he went  Soon the stern anchor had been paid out and the Ariadne was back to where she had started the buoy nudging the midships port side 
Neatly done Talbot said  Tell me Number One how are you on puzzles 
Useless  Even the simplest crossword baffles me 
No matter  We 're picking up a strange noise on the sonar 
Maybe you 'd like to take a turn along there perhaps even identify it  Baffles me 
Consider it done  Back in two or three minutes 
Twenty minutes elapsed before he returned to the bridge where Talbot was now alone as the ship was no longer under way Harrison had retired to his Mess  That was a long couple of minutes Vincent and what are you looking so pleased about 
I really do n't know how you do it sir  Incredible 
I do n't suppose you have any Scottish blood  Not a drop as far as I 'm aware 
Am I supposed to be following you Number One  I thought maybe the second sight 
You were right  A classic Greek beauty 
Irene  Miss Charial that is 
Odd mind you blonde as they come  I thought all those warm-blooded young Latin ladies had hair as black as a raven 's wing 
It 's the sheltered life you lead Vincent  You should go to Andalucia some day 
Seville  On one street corner a dusky Moorish maiden the next a Nordic blonde 
We 'll discuss pigmentation some other time  What did you learn 
Enough I hope  It 's an art sir this casual and inconsequential approach 
The questioning I mean  She seems honest and open enough not ingenuous if you know what I mean but quite straightforward 
Certainly did n't give the impression of having anything to hide  Says she does n't know the engine-room well but has been there a couple of times 
We came to the question of fuel oil I was just wondering out loud natural curiosity I hope she thought as to what could have caused the explosion  Seems I was wrong when I said there were just two common ways of arranging fuel and water tanks 
Seems there 's a third  Two big tanks on either side of the engine one fuel one water 
How big I do n't know she was a bit vague about that no reason why she should know but at least thousands of litres she says  If there was a spare fuel tank she did n't know about it 
I look forward sir to hearing Mr Andropulos justifying his decision not to abandon ship  So do I. Should be interesting 
Anyway congratulations  A good job 
No hardship sir  Van Gelder scanned the sea around 
Odd do n't you think sir  I mean are we the only ones who heard the SOS 
I would have thought the horizon would have been black with converging vessels by this time  Not so strange really 
Nearly all the vessels around at this time of year are private yachts and fishermen  Lots of them do n't carry any radio at all and even those who do almost certainly would n't be permanently tuned to the distress frequency 
But we are  This time I 'm ahead of you 
The Delos or at least Andropulos knew that we would be permanently tuned to the distress frequency that we are automatically alerted by bell or buzzer whenever the distress frequency is energized  This presupposes two things 
He knew we were a naval vessel and he also knew that we were in the vicinity  You realize what you are saying sir 
Sorry I did n't mean it to sound that way  But the implications sir 
I must say I really do n't like those at all  Neither do I. Opens up all sorts of avenues of interesting speculation does n't it 
He turned as McKenzie came on to the bridge And how are our oil-stained survivors Chief  Clean sir 
And in dry clothes  I do n't think any of them will make the list of the ten best-dressed men 
He looked at Van Gelder  I gather you did n't have too much time sir for the selection and careful matching up of clothes 
They 're a bit of an odd sight I must say but respectable enough  I knew you would want to see them Captain Mr Andropulos seems very anxious to see you and I know you do n't like unauthorized people on the bridge so I took the liberty of putting the four gentlemen and the two young ladies in the wardroom 
I hope that 's all right sir  Fine 
You might ask the Surgeon Commander and Lieutenant Denholm to join us there  And send a couple of your boys up here to keep a lookout 
Who knows our radar might have a day off  The six survivors from the Delos were standing around rather awkwardly not talking when Talbot and Van Gelder reached the wardroom 
The four men as McKenzie had suggested did present rather an odd spectacle  They looked rather as if they had just raided an old clothes shop few of the items of their clothing being a match and for the most part fitting only where they touched 
In striking contrast both girls were immaculately clad dressed in white blouses and white skirts they could have stepped straight from the pages of Vogue  Please Talbot said 
All of you be seated  Before we talk I suggest we get our priorities right 
First things first  You 've had a harrowing experience and a lucky escape 
I suggest you will not take amiss the suggestion of a suitable restorative  He pressed a bell and a steward entered 
Jenkins  Refreshments 
Find out what they would like  Jenkins did so and left 
I 'm the captain Talbot said  Talbot 
This is Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder  Ah 
The door had opened  And this is Surgeon-Commander Grierson whom you have met and whose services you fortunately did n't require and Lieutenant Denholm 
He looked at the short stocky man seated before him  I take it that you sir are Mr Andropulos the owner 
I am Commander I am  Andropulos had black hair black eyes white teeth and a deeply tanned complexion 
He looked as if he had n't shaved that morning but then he would always look as if he had n't shaved that morning  He leapt to his feet took Talbot 's hand and shook it vigorously 
He positively radiated a combined aura of benevolence and bonhomie  Words can not express our gratitude 
A close-run thing Commander a very close-run thing  We owe you our lives 
I would n't go as far as to say that but I 'll admit you were in a rather nasty pickle  Pickle 
Pickle  Dangerous circumstances 
I deeply regret both your loss of the members of your crew and your yacht  The yacht is nothing 
I can always buy another  Well Lloyd 's of London can buy it for me 
Still sadder to lose an old friend like the Delos but sadder still much sadder to lose the three members of my crew  Been with me for many years 
I treasured them all  Who were they sir 
My engineer chef and steward  With me for many years 
Andropulos shook his head  They will be sadly missed 
Was n't it odd for a chef and steward to be in the engine-room  Andropulos smiled sadly 
Not aboard the Delos Commander  It was not exactly run along the lines of a ship of the Royal Navy 
They were in the habit of having an after-lunch drink there with the engineer  They had my permission of course but they preferred to be discreet about it and what more discreet place than the engine-room 
Alas their discretion cost them their lives  That is ironic 
May I be introduced to the others  Of course of course 
This is my very dear friend Alexander  Alexander was a tall man with a thin unsmiling face and black cold eyes who did n't look as if he could possibly be anybody 's very dear friend 
This is Aristotle my captain  Andropulos did n't say whether Aristotle was the first or last name he had watchful eyes and a serious expression but looked as if he might unlike Alexander be capable of smiling occasionally 
And this is Achmed  He did n't say what occupation Achmed held 
He was young pleasant-faced and smiled readily  Talbot could n't even begin to guess at his nationality except that he was n't Greek 
But I forget myself  Deplorable deplorable 
I forget myself  Such manners 
Should have been ladies first of course  This is my niece Irene 
Van Gelder had n't made any mistakes about her Talbot thought except that he 'd missed out on the wide green eyes and a rather bewitching smile  And this is Eugenia 
This one Talbot reflected was much closer to Van Gelder 's concept of a warm-blooded young Latin lady  She had a slightly dusky skin black hair and warm brown eyes 
And she also no doubt was quite beautiful  It seemed to Talbot that Van Gelder was going to find himself in something of a quandary 
I congratulate you Mr Andropulos Talbot said gallantly and ourselves  Certainly the loveliest passengers we 've ever had aboard the Ariadne 
Ah  The steward 
Andropulos took his glass a scotch and not a small one and disposed of half the contents in one gulp  My goodness I needed that 
Thank you Commander thank you  Not as young as I was nor as tough either 
Age cometh to us all  He quaffed the rest of his drink and sighed 
Talbot said Jenkins another for Mr Andropulos  A slightly larger measure this time 
Jenkins looked at him expressionlessly closed his eyes momentarily and left  The Ariadne Andropulos said 
Rather odd is it not  Greek name British vessel 
Courtesy gesture to your Government sir  We are carrying out a hydrographic charting exercise with your people 
Talbot saw no point in mentioning that the Ariadne had never carried out a hydrographic exercise in its life and that the ship had been called Ariadne to remind the Greeks that it was a multi-national vessel and to persuade a wavering Greek government that perhaps NATO was n't such a bad thing after all  Hydrographic you say 
Is that why we 're moored fore and aft a fixed platform for taking bearings  A fixed platform yes but in this instance the purpose is not hydrographic 
We 've had quite a busy afternoon Mr Andropulos and at the moment we 're anchored over a plane that crashed into the sea just about the time we were receiving your SOS  A plane 
Crashed  Good God 
What what kind of plane  We have no idea 
It was so wreathed in smoke that it was impossible to distinguish any important features  But surely well do n't you think it was a big plane 
It may have been  But it could have been a big jet 
Maybe hundreds of passengers  If Andropulos knew it was n't a jet carrying hundreds of passengers his face was n't saying so 
It 's always possible  Talbot saw no point in telling Andropulos that it was almost certainly a bomber and equally certainly not carrying hundreds of passengers 
You you mean to tell me that you left the area to come to our aid  A reasonable enough decision I think 
We were pretty certain that there were people alive aboard the Delos and we were also pretty certain that there was no one alive aboard that plane  There could have been survivors aboard that plane 
I mean you were n't there to see  Mr Andropulos 
Talbot allowed a certain coldness to creep into his voice  We are I hope neither callous nor stupid 
Before leaving we lowered one of our motorboats to circle the area  There were no survivors 
Oh dear Irene Charial said  Is n't it awful 
All those people dead and there we were busy doing nothing except feeling sorry for ourselves  I 'm not being inquisitive Captain and I know it 's none of my business but why do you remain anchored here 
I mean there ca n't possibly be any hope now that some survivors may surface  There is no hope Miss Charial 
We 're remaining here as a marker until the diving ship arrives  He did n't like lying to her but thought it inadvisable to tell her that there was no rescue ship hurrying to the scene and that as far as he knew the only other people who knew of the disaster were the NATO HQ in Italy 
More especially he did n't want any person or persons in her company to know  But but it will be too late to save anyone 
It 's already too late young lady  But they 'll send divers down to investigate to find out whether it 's a passenger-carrying jet or not and to try to ascertain the cause of the accident 
He was looking without seeming to look at Andropulos as he said the last words and felt almost certain that he saw a flicker of expression cross his face  Andropulos 's captain Aristotle spoke for the first time 
How deep is this plane Commander  Seventeen eighteen fathoms 
Just over thirty metres or so  Thirty metres Andropulos said 
Even if they do get inside and there 's no guarantee that they will be able to do so wo n't it be difficult to move around and see anything  I can guarantee they 'll get inside 
There are such things as oxyacetylene torches you know  And they 'll have powerful underwater torches 
But they wo n't bother with either of those things  The divers will carry down a couple of slings with them 
A diving ship will have no difficulty at all in bringing the fuselage to the surface  Then they 'll be able to examine the plane at their leisure 
This time there was no trace of expression in Andropulos 's face Talbot wondered if he Andropulos had become aware that such changes in expression were being sought for  Jenkins entered and handed Talbot a sealed envelope 
From the radio-room sir  Myers said it was urgent 
Talbot nodded opened the envelope extracted and read the slip of paper it had held  He slipped it in his pocket and stood 
My apologies ladies and gentlemen  I have to go to the bridge 
Come along with me Number One  I 'll join you at seven o'clock for dinner 
Once outside Van Gelder said You really are a fearful liar sir  A fearfully good liar I mean 
Andropulos is n't half bad either  He 's had practice 
Between the two of you well in his own phrase it 's a close-run thing  Ah thank you 
He unfolded the slip of paper Talbot had handed him  Vitally urgent you remain in closest contact with downed plane Stop will join you earliest in the morning Stop Hawkins 
Is n't that the Vice-Admiral sir  None other 
Vitally urgent and flying down to see us  What do you make of that 
I make it that he knows something that we do n't  Indeed 
Incidentally you 've kind of forgotten to tell me about your visit to sonar  Sorry about that sir 
I had something else on my mind  Somebody not something 
Having seen her I can understand  Well 
The noise from the plane  Tick tick tick 
Could be anything  Halzman half suggested it might be some sort of timing device 
Could be that he 's right  I do n't want to sound alarmist sir but I do n't think I like it very much 
I do n't particularly care for it myself  Well then the radio-room 
I thought you said you were going to the bridge  That was for Andropulos 's benefit 
The less that character knows about anything the better  I think he 's cunning astute and alert for the slightest nuances 
Is that why you did n't make any reference to the engine-room explosion  Yes 
I may of course be doing him a massive injustice  For all I know he may be as fresh and innocent as the dawn 's early dew 
You do n't really believe that sir  No 
Myers was alone in the radio-room  Another message to Rome Talbot said 
Again Code B. To Vice-Admiral Hawkins  Message received 
Strongly advise that you come soonest  Tonight 
Report repeated two and a half second ticking sounds from plane  Could be timing device 
Please phone immediately  A ticking sound possibly a timing device Talbot says 
Vice-Admiral Hawkins was standing by Carson 's chair as the general read and re-read the slip of paper Hawkins had just handed him  A timing device 
We do n't have to discuss the implications of this  From his high-rise office Carson looked out over the roofs of Rome then at the colonel across the desk then finally up at Hawkins 
He pressed a button on his desk  Get me the Pentagon 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was also standing as the man behind the desk read the slip of paper he had just been handed  He read it three times laid it down carefully on the desk smoothed it out and looked across at the Chairman 
His face looked drawn and tired and old  We know what this means or what it could mean 
If anything goes wrong the international repercussions will be enormous General  I 'm afraid I 'm fully aware of that sir 
Apart from the universal condemnation we will become the pariah dog the outcasts of the world  And no hint of any Soviet involvement 
None whatsoever  No proof direct or indirect 
As far as the world is concerned they are blameless  My first reaction is that they are indeed blameless 
My second thoughts are exactly the same  I can see no way they are linked with this 
We bear the burden sir  We bear the burden 
And will stand condemned before the court of mankind  The General made no reply 
The Chiefs have no suggestions  None that I regard as very useful 
In short bluntly none  We have to rely on our people out there 
Carte blanche sir  We have no option 
How good are your men in the Mediterranean  The very best 
No rhetoric sir  I mean it 
And this British vessel on the spot  The frigate Ariadne 
A very special vessel indeed I am given to understand  Whether or not it can cope with this no one can say 
There are too many imponderables  Do we pull it out 
That 's not for my decision sir  I know it 's not 
He was silent for a long moment then said It may be our only hope  It stays 
Yes Mr President  Talbot was alone with Van Gelder on the bridge when the radio-room called 
I have voice contact with Rome sir  Where will you take it 
Here  He gestured to Van Gelder to take up a listening phone 
Talbot here  Hawkins 
I 'm leaving shortly with two civilians for Athens  You 'll have a phone call from there letting you know our estimated time of arrival 
We 'll be landing on Thera Island  Have a launch standing by to meet us 
Yes sir  Take a taxi down to Athinio there 's a new quay about two miles south of the Thira Village anchorage 
My map shows that the Thira anchorage is nearer  What your map may not show is that the only way down to Thira anchorage is by mule-track down a precipitous cliff 
A seven-hundred-foot cliff to be precise  Thank you Talbot 
A life saved  You have not forgotten my twin bÃªtes noires my fatal flaws 
Till this evening then  What bÃªtes noires 
Van Gelder said  What flaws 
He hates horses  I would imagine the detestation extends to mules 
And he suffers from acrophobia  That sounds a very nasty thing to suffer from 
And what might that be  Vertigo 
A fear of heights  Almost got him disbarred from entry to the Navy 
He had a powerful aversion to climbing up rigging  You know him well then 
Pretty well  Now this evening 
I 'd normally send young Henri to pick anybody up but Vice-Admiral Hawkins and the two no doubt equally distinguished civilians who are with him are not anybody  So we do it in style 
A Lieutenant-Commander I thought  My pleasure sir 
And tell them all you know about the plane the Delos and the survivors  Also our suspicions about the survivors 
Saves the time when they get here  I 'll do that 
Speaking about the survivors when I go ashore do you want me to take them along and dump them  You are unwell Number One 
I 'm fine  Did n't for a moment think you 'd want them out of your sight 
And we could n't very well abandon the two young ladies on that barren rock there  It 's as well the islanders ca n't hear you 
There 's fourteen hundred people in the Thira township and there 's a fair amount of tourist accommodation  And speaking again of the survivors not to mention our three other visitors we 'll have to find sleeping accommodation for them 
The Admiral can have the admiral 's cabin it 'll be the first time an admiral has slept there  There are three empty cabins 
You can have mine I 'll sleep here or in the chart-room  The rest well you fix it 
Five minutes said he confidently  He was back in forty-five 
Took me a little longer than I thought  Ticklish problems 
Who 's got my cabin  Irene 
Eugenia has mine  It took you three-quarters of an hour to arrange that 
Decisions decisions  Calls for a little delicacy and a modicum of finesse 
My word you do do yourselves well Commander Andropulos said  He sipped some claret 
Or is this a special treat for us  Standard fare I assure you 
Andropulos whom Grierson had reported as having a remarkable affinity for scotch seemed relaxed to the point of garrulity  Talbot would have taken long odds that he was cold sober 
He talked freely about quite a number of subjects but had not once broached the question of being sent ashore  It was clear that he and Talbot had at least one thing in common the wish that he remain aboard the Ariadne 
Jenkins came in and spoke softly to Van Gelder who looked at Talbot  Call from the radio-room 
Shall I take it  Talbot nodded 
Van Gelder left and returned within half a minute  Call was delayed sir 
Difficulty in contacting us  They will be there in less than half an hour 
I 'd better go now  I 'm expecting visitors later this evening Talbot said 
I shall have to ask you not to come to the wardroom for some time after they come  Not for too long 
Twenty minutes at the most  Visitors 
Andropulos said  At this time of the evening 
Who on earth are they  I 'm sorry Mr Andropulos 
This is a naval vessel  There are certain things I ca n't discuss with civilians 
Vice-Admiral Hawkins was the first up the gangway  He shook Talbot 's hand warmly 
The Admiral did n't go in much for saluting  Delighted to see you again John 
Or I would be if it were n't for the circumstances  And how are you my boy 
Fine sir  Again considering the circumstances 
And the children  Little Fiona and Jimmy 
In the best thank you sir  You 've come a long way in a short time 
Needs must when the devil drives  And he 's sitting on my tail right now 
He turned to the two men who had followed him up the gangway  Professor Benson 
Dr Wickram  Gentlemen Commander Talbot the captain of the Ariadne 
If you will come with me gentlemen  I 'll have your gear taken to your quarters 
Talbot led them to the wardroom and gestured them to their seats  You want me to get my priorities right 
Certainly  Talbot pressed a bell and Jenkins came in 
A large gin and tonic for those two gentlemen Hawkins said  Lots of ice 
They 're Americans  Large scotch and water for me 
Quarters you said  What quarters 
You have n't been aboard since before commissioning but you wo n't have forgotten  For an admiral an admiral 's quarters 
Never been used  How perfectly splendid 
Honoured I 'm sure  And for my two friends here 
A cabin apiece  Also never been used 
I think they 'll find them quite comfortable  I 'd like to bring along some of my officers sir 
But of course  Whom did you have in mind 
Surgeon-Commander Grierson  Know him Hawkins said 
Very wise bird  Lieutenant Denholm 
Our electronic Wunderkind  I know you 've met him sir 
That I have  He looked at his two friends smiling broadly 
You 'll have to mind your p's and q's here  Lieutenant Denholm is the heir to an earldom 
The genuine article  Fearfully languid and aristocratic 
Do n't be deceived for an instant  Mind like a knife 
As I told General Carson he 's so incredibly advanced in his electronic speciality that your high-tech whizzkids in Silicon Valley would n't even begin to understand what he 's talking about  Then there 's Lieutenant McCafferty our senior engineer and of course Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder whom you 've already met 
For the first time  Favourably impressed 
Very  Struck me as an able lad indeed 
He 's all that  More 
If I were laid low tomorrow you would n't have to worry  He could take over the Ariadne at any moment and you would n't notice the difference 
From you that 's worth any half-dozen testimonials  I 'll bear it in mind 
Introductions completed Hawkins looked at Talbot and his four officers and said The first question in your minds of course gentlemen is why I have brought two civilians with me  First I will tell you who they are and then when I have explained the purpose of our coming you will understand why they are here 
In passing I might say how extraordinarily lucky I am to have them here with me  They seldom leave their home state of California it just so happened that both were attending an international conference in Rome 
Professor Alec Benson here  Benson was a large calm man in his early sixties grey of hair cherubic and cheerful of countenance and wearing a sports jacket flannels and polo jersey all of varying shades of grey and all so lived in comfortable and crumpled that he could well have inherited them from his grandfather 
The Professor is the director of the seismological department of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena  He 's also a geologist and vulcanologist 
Anything that makes the earth bang or shake or move is his field  Regarded by everybody in that line as the world 's leading expert he chaired or was chairing until I so rudely interrupted him an international conference in seismology in Rome 
You all know of course what seismology is  A rough idea Talbot said 
A kind of science I think study would be a better word for it of the causes and effects of earthquakes  A kind of science 
Hawkins said  I am distressed 
It is a science  No offence meant I 'm sure and none taken Benson said equably 
The Commander is perfectly correct  Far from being a science we 're still only dabbling on the periphery of the subject 
Ah well  Dr Wickram is a physicist as well known in his own field as Professor Benson is in his 
He specializes in nuclear physics  Talbot looked at Dr Wickram who in startling contrast to Benson was thin dark and immaculately dressed in a blue suit white button-down collar and a black tie the funereal hue of which went rather well with the habitual severity of his expression and said Does your interest in nuclear physics extend to nuclear weaponry Dr Wickram 
Well yes it does rather  You and the Professor are to be congratulated 
There should be some kind of civilian medal for this  Vice-Admiral Hawkins of course is acting in the line of duty 
I would have thought you two gentlemen should have stayed in Rome  I mean is n't it safer there 
Hawkins cleared his throat  You would n't dream of stealing a superior officer 's thunder would you 
I would n't dream of it sir  Well to the point 
Your two signals duly received  The first gave rise to some concern the second was profoundly disturbing 
The tick tick tick bit sir  The tick tick tick bit 
Both signals were sent to the Pentagon the second one also going to the White House  I should imagine that the word consternation would suitably describe their reaction 
Guessing of course but I think the speed of the reply to the second message showed how badly shaken they were  Normally it can take forever well even months at times to extract just a nugget of information from the Pentagon but this time minutes only 
When I read their reply I could understand all too well  Hawkins paused possibly for suitable dramatic effect 
So can I Talbot said  What do you mean 
If I were the Pentagon or the White House I 'd be upset too if a US Air Force bomber or cargo plane carrying a load of bombs suddenly disappeared into the sea  Especially if the bombs or missiles that plane was carrying were of the nuclear variety 
Even more especially if they were hydrogen bombs  Well damn your eyes Talbot you do deprive ageing vice-admirals of the simpler pleasures of life 
There goes my thunder  It was n't all that difficult sir 
We had already guessed it was a bomber  Civilian planes with the exception of Concorde do n't fly at the height at which we picked it up 
We 'd have had to be pretty stupid not to assume what we did  Bombers usually carry bombs 
American reaction made it inevitable that it was an American plane  And you would n't have come down here in such a tearing hurry and be accompanied by an expert in nuclear weaponry unless the bombs were of a rather nasty variety 
I ca n't imagine anything nastier than hydrogen bombs  Nor can anyone 
When you put it the way you put it I suppose I should have guessed that you had guessed  Even the Pentagon do n't know or wo n't divulge what type of plane it was 
They suggest an advanced design of the C.141 Starlifter cargo plane  It was refuelled in the Azores and heading for Greece 
From your first message we gathered you saw the plane crash into the sea but could n't identify it  Why not 
Number One show the Admiral why not  Van Gelder produced a sheaf of photographs and handed them to Hawkins who flipped through them quickly and then more slowly a second time 
He sighed and looked up  Intriguing I suppose if you 're a connoisseur of the pattern effects of smoke and flame 
I 'm not  All I can make out is what I take to be the outer port engine and that 's no help at all 
And it gives no indication as to the source or cause of the fire  I think Van Gelder would disagree with you sir Talbot said 
He 's of the opinion that the fire originated in the nose cone and was caused by an internal explosion  I agree with him 
It certainly was n't brought down by ship-based anti-aircraft fire  We would have known 
The only alternative is a heat-seeking missile  Two objections to that 
Such a missile would have targeted on the engines not the fuselage and more importantly there are no vessels in the area  Our radar would have picked them up 
As a corollary to that the missile did n't come from an aircraft either  The Admiral will not need reminding that the radar aboard the Ariadne is as advanced as any in the world 
That may no longer be true sir  Denholm 's tone was deferential but not hesitant 
And if it is true then we ca n't discount missiles just like that  This is not a dissenting opinion I 'm just exploring another possibility 
Explore away Lieutenant Hawkins said  Any light that can illumine the darkness of our ignorance etcetera etcetera 
I 'm not sure I 'm all that good as a beacon sir  I do know that I do n't go along with the belief that the Soviets always trail the West in technological advancement 
Whether this belief is carefully and officially nurtured I do not know  I admit that the Soviets spend a certain amount of time and trouble in extracting military secrets from the West 
I say certain because they do n't have to try all that hard there appears to be a steady supply of scientists both American and British who along with associates not necessarily involved in direct research at all are perfectly willing to sell the Soviets anything they want provided that is the price is right  I believe this to be true in the case of computers where they do lag behind the West I do not believe it in the case of radar 
In this field Plessey of Britain probably leads the West  They have developed a revolutionary new radar system the Type 966 which is fitted or about to be fitted to Invincible-class aircraft-carriers the Type 42 Sheffield-class destroyers and the new Type 23 Norfolk-class frigates 
This new radar is designed not only to detect and track aircraft and sea-skimming missiles but it also  Hawkins cleared his throat 
Sorry to interrupt Denholm  You may know this but surely it comes under the heading of classified information 
If it did I would n't talk about it even in this company sir  It 's in the public domain 
As I was about to say it 's also able to control Sea Dart and Seawolf missiles in flight and home them in on their targets with great accuracy  I also understand they 're virtually immune to jamming and radar decoys 
If Plessey have done this the Soviets may well have also  They 're not much given to advertising such things 
But I believe they have the know-how  Hawkins said And you also believe in this case that a missile was the culprit 
Not at all sir  I 'm only suggesting a possibility 
The Captain and Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder may well be right  Trouble is I know nothing about explosives 
Maybe there are missiles with such a limited charge that they cause only limited damage  I would have thought that a standard missile would have ensured that a plane it brought down would not have struck the sea with its fuselage relatively intact but in a thousand pieces 
Again I simply do n't know  I just wonder what the security was like at the base from which that plane took off in the States 
Security  In the case of a super-sensitive plane such as this 
Total  Does the Admiral really believe there is such a thing as total security 
The Admiral did n't say what he believed he just sipped his scotch in silence  There were four major air disasters last year all four planes involved having taken off from airports which were regarded as having maximum security 
In all four cases terrorists found the most stringent airport checks childishly easy to circumvent  Those were civilian airports 
This would be a top-secret US Air Force base manned exclusively by US Air Force personnel specially chosen for their position rigidly screened backgrounds exhaustively researched and all subjected to lie-detector tests  With respect to the Vice-Admiral and our American friends lie-detector tests more accurately polygraph tests are rubbish 
Any moderately intelligent person can be trained to beat the polygraph test which after all depends on crudely primitive measurements of pulse rate blood pressure and perspiration  You can be trained to give right answers wrong answers or merely confusing ones and the scrutineer ca n't tell the difference 
Does n't measure up to your idea of electronics eh  Nothing to do with electronics sir 
Polygraphs belong to the horse-and-buggy era  You 've just used the word super-sensitive sir 
The Ariadne if I may put it that way is a hotbed of super-sensitivity  How many members of this crew have ever been subjected to a polygraph test 
None  Hawkins considered his glass for a few moments then looked up at Talbot 
Should the need arise Captain how long would it take you to contact the Pentagon  Immediately 
Well half a minute  Now 
No  Wait 
Have to think about it  Trouble is even the Pentagon is having difficulty in extracting information from this Air Force base which is I believe somewhere in Georgia 
The Pentagon 's own fault really although you ca n't expect them to admit this  They 've so inculcated this passion for absolute secrecy into the senior officers of all four services that no one is prepared to reveal anything without the permission of the commanding officer of the Air Force base or ship or whatever 
In this particular case the commanding officer who to the Pentagon 's distress would appear to have a human side to his nature has elected to take twenty-four hours off  No one appears to know where he is 
Van Gelder said Makes it a bit awkward sir does n't it if war breaks out in the next half-hour  No 
Base remains in full operational readiness  But there 's still no relaxation of the iron-bound rules concerning the release of classified information 
Talbot said You would n't be sitting here unless they 'd released some information  Naturally not 
The news they 've released is vague and incomplete but all very very bad  One report says there were twelve nuclear weapons aboard another fifteen 
Whether they were missiles or bombs was not disclosed what was disclosed was that they were hydrogen devices each one in the monster megaton range twelve to fifteen megatons  The plane was also understood to be carrying two of the more conventional atom bombs 
I think I 'll break a self-imposed regulation and have a scotch myself Talbot said  A half-minute passed in silence then he said quietly This is worse than I ever dreamed 
Dream  Grierson said 
Nightmare  Dream or nightmare it wo n't matter to us Lieutenant Denholm said 
Not when we 're drifting through the stratosphere in vaporized orbit  A hydrogen bomb Dr Wickram Talbot said 
Let's call it that  Is there any way it can spontaneously detonate 
In itself impossible  The President of the United States has to press one button the man on the spot another the radio frequencies are so wildly different that the chances of anyone happening on the right combination are billions to one 
Is there a chance say a billion to one that the Soviets might have this combination  None 
You say it 's impossible to detonate in itself  Is there any other way some external means whereby it could be detonated 
I do n't know  Does that mean you 're not saying or that you 're not sure 
I do n't think Dr Wickram that this is the time to dwell on such verbal niceties  I 'm not sure 
If there were a sufficiently powerful explosion close by it might go up by sympathetic detonation  We simply do n't know 
The possibility has never been explored  I mean no experiments 
I should hope not Lieutenant Denholm said  If such an experiment were successful I would n't care to be within thirty or forty miles at the time 
That is one point  For the first time Dr Wickram essayed a smile but it was a pretty wintry one 
In the second place quite frankly we have never envisaged a situation where such a possibility might arise  We could I suppose have carried out such an experiment without the drastic consequences the Lieutenant has suggested 
We could detonate a very small atom bomb in the vicinity of another  Even a charge of conventional explosive in the vicinity of a small atom bomb would suffice 
If the small atom bomb went up so then would the hydrogen bomb  Everybody knows that it 's the fissioning of an atom bomb that triggers off the fusion of a hydrogen bomb 
Talbot said Is there any timing device specifically a delayed one fitted in a hydrogen bomb  None 
The flat finality in the voice left no room for argument  According to Vice-Admiral Hawkins there may be a couple of conventional atom bombs aboard the sunken plane 
Could they be fitted with timing devices  Again I do n't know 
Not my field  But I see no reason why they could n't be 
For what purpose  Search me 
Realms of speculation Captain where your guess is as good as mine  The only thing that occurs to me is a mine a marine mine 
Neatly dispose of any passing aircraft carrier I should think  That 's thinking small Van Gelder said 
A hydrogen mine would neatly dispose of any passing battle fleet  Whose passing fleet 
One of ours  In wartime as in peace-time the seas are open to all 
Not the Black Sea  Not in wartime 
But a bit far-fetched  How would this mine be activated 
My continued ignorance must be a great disappointment  I know nothing about mines 
Well time was when mines were either magnetic or acoustic  Degaussing has made magnetic mines passÃ© 
So acoustic  Triggered by a passing ship 's engines 
Interesting is n't it  I mean we 've passed over it several times since we first heard the ticking and we 've triggered nothing 
So far  So maybe that ticking does n't mean that the mine is set to go off any time 
Maybe it 's not activated by which I mean ready to go off when a vessel passes over it until the ticking stops  Or maybe it 's just set to go up whenever the ticking stops 
Trouble is we 've no idea what started the ticking in the first place  I ca n't see any way it could have been deliberate 
Must have been caused by the explosion that brought down the plane or by the impact of striking the water  You 're a source of great comfort Van Gelder Hawkins said heavily 
I admit sir that the alternatives are n't all that attractive  My own conclusions which in this case are probably completely worthless are that this ticking represents a period of grace I mean that it can not explode as long as the ticking lasts and that it 's not designed to explode when the ticking stops but is then activated and ready to explode when triggered by passing engines 
A guess sir but not necessarily a wild one  I 'm going on the assumption that this mine could well be dropped by a surface vessel as well as a plane 
In that case the ship would want to be a large number of miles away before the mine was activated  So it would start the timing mechanism running at the moment it dropped it over the side 
I am sure sir that the Pentagon could provide some illumination on this subject  I 'm sure it could Hawkins said 
And your conclusions are far from worthless they make a good deal of sense to me  Well Captain what do you propose to do about all this 
I rather thought sir that your purpose in coming down here was to tell me what to do  Not at all 
I just came to make myself au fait with the situation and to garner some information in return for some I give you  Does this mean Admiral I say this carefully you understand that I have a hand in making the decisions 
You do n't have a hand  You damn well make them 
I 'll endorse them  Thank you 
Then my first decision or if you like a suggestion respectfully made is that you and your two friends depart for Rome immediately  It 's not going to help anyone and will be a considerable loss to both the scientific and naval communities if you three gentlemen elect for self-immolation 
Besides by asking me to make the decisions you have implied that there 's nothing you can do here that my crew and I ca n't  Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder is at your immediate service 
The Lieutenant-Commander will have to wait  For me at least 
Your logic is sound but I 'm not feeling very logical at the moment  But I do agree as far as my two friends are concerned 
They could be back at their international conference in Rome tomorrow without anyone having noticed their absence  We have no right to put the lives of civilians not to mention two such eminent civilians at risk 
You 've just put your finger on it Admiral  Benson puffed comfortably on a sadly blackened pipâ€“ 
Eminent or not we are civilians  Civilians do n't take orders from the military 
I prefer the Aegean to Rome  Agreed Wickram said 
Ludicrous  Preposterous 
You do n't seem to have any more clout with your two friends than I have with the three of you  Talbot produced two slips of paper from his inner pocket 
I suggest you sign those sir  Hawkins took them looked thoughtfully at Talbot scanned the two sheets then read from one of them 
'Request urgent immediate dispatch of nearest salvage or diving vessel to 36.21N 25.22E due south Cape Akrotiri Thera Island to recover one sunken plane one sunken yacht  Further request immediate dispatch by plane to Thera Island two deep-sea divers with diving equipment for four repeat four 
Priority one double A. Signed Vice-Admiral Hawkins  Hawkins looked at Benson and Wickram 
This message is directed to Rear-Admiral Blyth HMS Apollo  Rear-Admiral Blyth is the operational commander of European section of NATO sea forces in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Priority one double A means drop everything else this has absolute priority  Admiral Hawkins is I take it my good self 
Why Captain the request for four diving suits  Van Gelder and I are trained divers sir 
Ex-submariners  I see 
Second signal directed to Defence Minister Athens  Urgent contact Air Control Athens airport for information re aircraft thought American that crashed 1415 today south of Thera Island 
Did it ask permission for flight path to and landing in Athens or other Greek airfield  Further request you enlist immediate aid of police and Intelligence re anything known about one Syros Andropulos owner of yacht Delos 
This message is also I 'm flattered to observe signed by me  Well well well Captain I nearly did you a great injustice a minute or two ago I thought you had not perhaps addressed yourself to the problem on hand 
But you have and in some style and quite some time before I arrived  Two questions 
The aircraft and Andropulos  Hawkins nodded 
At 43,000 feet the pilot did n't have to bother to notify anyone about his presence  He knew he was alone in the sky 
But once he started descending it was a different matter entirely  He would n't be too keen on bumping into anyone especially not with the cargo he had on board 
And of course he would require permission to land  But why Greece 
Because the flight path he was following when we first located him would have taken him to Ankara in Turkey or some place pretty close by  Now even although Turkey is nominally at least a member of NATO I 'm sure the Americans have no air bases at or near Ankara 
I do n't even know if they have any air bases at all in Turkey  I 'm certain they have no missile launching bases 
In Greece the Americans have both  So Greece 
As for Andropulos several of my officers and I think he 's a leery customer and a suspicious one  Not one thing that could be proved in a court of law of course 
We suspect that he may know something about the downing of this plane that we do n't know he knows if you follow me  He says the Delos was sunk as the result of an explosion 
But it 's the old question of did he fall or was he pushed  In other words was the explosion accidental or deliberate 
If we could hoist the Delos to the surface we might well find out  We might well indeed 
Still first things first  Hawkins looked briefly at the signals again 
Seem to fit the task admirably  I 'll gladly sign 
Hawkins produced a pen signed and handed the papers to Talbot  As you had all this figured out quite some time I suspect before I left Rome why did n't you send those signals yourself 
Lowly commanders do n't give the instructions to Rear-Admiral Blyth  I have n't the authority 
You have  That 's why I asked you to join us as soon as was possible 
Thanks for the signing sir  That was the easy part 
Now comes the difficult part  Difficult part 
Hawkins said warily  What difficult part 
Have we the moral right to ask the crew of the salvage vessel or lifting vessel not to mention the divers to join us in Lieutenant Denholm 's elegant phrase in drifting through the stratosphere in vaporized orbit  Ah 
Yes  A point of course 
What do you think  Again not a decision for lowly commanders 
Admirals only  Dear oh dear 
Then if things go wrong you 'll have nothing on your conscience and everything in the world to reproach me with  If anything goes wrong sir I do n't think we 'll be having too much to say to each other when we 're in vaporized orbit 
True  Mine was an unworthy remark 
No one likes to bear the responsibility for such decisions  Send the signals 
Very good sir  Lieutenant Denholm ask Myers to come here 
Hawkins said I understand I 'm not making comparisons that the President of the United States was faced with a problem similar to the one you 've just confronted me with  He asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff if he should pull out the Ariadne which they knew of course was sitting over the crashed plane 
The Chairman said quite rightly that that was n't his responsibility the old and honoured American tradition of passing the buck  The President decided that the Ariadne should stay 
Well I could come all over bitter and say that 's very noble and gallant of the President especially as there 's no chance of his being blown out of his seat in the Oval Office when this little lot goes up but I wo n't  It 's not a decision I would care to have to make 
I assume he gave a reason for his decision  Yes 
The greatest good of the greatest number  Myers came in 
Talbot handed him the two messages  Get these off at once 
Code B in both cases  To both messages add Immediate repeat Immediate confirmation is requested 
Myers left and Talbot said It is my understanding Admiral that in your capacity as officer commanding the naval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean you have the power to overrule the President 's instructions  Yes 
Have you done so  No 
You will ask why  Same reason as the President 
The greatest good of the greatest number  Why the questioning Captain 
You would n't leave here even if I gave a direct order  I 'm just a bit puzzled about the reason given the greatest good of the greatest number 
Bringing a rescue vessel which admittedly is my idea will only increase the greatest danger to a greater number  I do n't think you quite appreciate just how great the greatest number is in this case 
I think Professor Benson here can enlighten you  Enlighten all of us for I 'm rather vague about it 
That 's why Professor Benson is here  The good Professor is not at his best Benson said 
He 's hungry  Most remiss of us Talbot said 
Of course you have n't eaten  Dinner say in twenty minutes 
I 'd settle for a sandwich  Talbot looked at Hawkins and Wickram both of whom nodded 
He pressed a bell  I 'm a bit vague about it myself Benson said 
Certain facts are beyond dispute  What we 're sitting on top of at this moment is one of them 
According to which estimate of the Pentagon 's you choose to believe there 's something like a total of between 144 and 225 megatons of high explosive lying down there  Not that the difference between the lowest and highest estimate is of any significance 
The explosion of a pound of high explosive in this wardroom would kill us all  What we are talking about is the explosive power of let me see yes four and a half billion pounds 
The human mind can not comprehend differences in estimates become irrelevant  All we can say with certainty is that it would be the biggest man-made explosion in history which does n't sound so bad when you say it quickly as I 'm saying it now 
The results of such an explosion are quite unknown but stupefyingly horrendous however optimistic your guess might be if optimistic is the word I 'm looking for which it is n't  It might fracture the earth 's crust with cataclysmic results 
It might destroy part of the ozone layer which would permit the sun 's ultra-violet radiation either to tan us or fry us depending upon how large a hole had been blasted in the stratosphere it might equally well cause the onset of a nuclear winter which is so popular a topic among both scientists and laymen these days  And lastly but by no means least are the tsunami effects vast tidal waves usually generated by undersea earthquakes those tsunami have been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people at a time when they struck low-lying coastal areas 
Benson reached out a grateful hand for a glass that Jenkins had brought  Talbot said If you 're trying to be encouraging Professor you 're not doing too well at it 
Ah better much better  Benson lowered his glass and sighed 
I needed that  There are times when I 'm quite capable of terrifying even myself 
Encouraging  That 's only the half of it 
Santorini 's the other half  In fact Santorini is the major part of it 
Gifted though mankind is in creating sheer wanton destruction nature has him whacked every time  Santorini 
Wickram said  Who or what is Santorini 
Ignorance George ignorance  You and your fellow physicists should look out from your ivory towers from time to time 
Santorini is less than a couple of miles from where you 're sitting  Had that name for many centuries 
Today it 's officially known as it was five thousand years ago at the height of its civilization as Thera Island  The island by whatever name has had a very turbulent seismic and volcanic history 
Do n't worry George I 'm not about to sally forth on my old hobby-horse not for long anyway just long enough to try to explain what the greatest number means in the term the greatest good of the greatest number  It is commonly enough imagined that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are two faces of the same coin 
This is not necessarily so  The venerable Oxford English Dictionary states that an earthquake is specifically a convulsion of the earth 's surface caused by volcanic forces 
The dictionary is specifically wrong it should have used the word rarely instead  Earthquakes especially the big ones are caused when two tectonic plates segments of the earth 's crust that float freely on the molten magma beneath come into contact with one another and one plate bangs into another or rubs alongside it or dives under it 
The only two recorded and monitored giant earthquakes in history were of this type in Ecuador in 1906 and Japan in 1933  Similarly but on a lesser scale although still very big the Californian earthquakes of San Francisco and Owens Valley were due to crustal movement and not to volcanoes 
It is true that practically all the world 's 500â€“600 active volcanoes someone may have bothered to count them I have n't are located along convergent plate boundaries  It is equally true that they are rarely associated with earthquakes 
There have been three large volcanic eruptions along such boundaries in very recent years Mt St Helens in the state of Washington El ChichÃ³n in Mexico and one just north-west of BogotÃ¡ in Columbia  The last one it happened only last year was particularly nasty 
A 17,000-foot volcano called Nevada del Ruiz which seems to have been slumbering off and on for the past four hundred years erupted and melted the snow and ice which covered most of its upper reaches giving rise to an estimated seventy-five million cubic yards mudslide  The town of Armero stood in its way 
25,000 people died there  The point is that none of those was accompanied by an earthquake 
Even volcanoes in areas where there are no established tectonic frontiers are guiltless in this respect Vesuvius despite the fact that it buried Pompeii and Herculaneum Stromboli Mt Etna and the twin volcanoes of the island of Hawaii have not produced and do not produce earthquakes  But the really bad apples in the seismic barrel and a very sinister lot those are too are the so-called thermal hotspots plumes or upswellings of molten lava that reach up to or through the earth 's crust giving rise to volcanoes or earthquakes or both 
We talk a lot about those thermal plumes but we really do n't know much about them  We do n't know whether they 're localized or whether they spread out and lubricate the movements of the tectonic plates 
What we do know is that they can have extremely unpleasant effects  One of those was responsible for the biggest earthquake of this century 
You have me confused Professor Hawkins said  You 've just mentioned the really big ones the ones in Japan and Ecuador 
Ah  But those were monitored and recorded 
This one was n't  Certainly it was 
But countries like Russia and China are rather coy about releasing such details  They have the weird notion that natural disasters reflect upon their political systems 
Is it in order to ask how you know  Of course 
Governments may elect not to talk to governments but we scientists are an incurably gabby lot  This quake happened in Tangshan province in north-east China and is the only one ever known to have occurred in a really densely populated area in this case involving the major cities of Peking and Tientsin 
The primary cause was undoubtedly a thermal plume  There are no known tectonic plate boundaries in the area but a very ancient boundary may be lurking in the area 
The date was July 27 1976  Yesterday Hawkins said 
Just yesterday  Casualties 
Two-thirds of a million dead three-quarters of a million injured  Give or take a hundred thousand in each case 
If that sounds flippant or heartless it 's not meant to be  After a certain arbitrary figure a hundred thousand ten thousand even a thousand it all depends upon how much your heart and mind can take any increase in numbers becomes meaningless 
And there 's also the factor of course that we 're referring to faceless unknowns in a far-off land  I suppose Hawkins said that that would be what one might call the grand-daddy of them all 
In terms of lives lost it probably is  We ca n't be sure 
What we can be sure of is that Tangshan rates as no more than third in the cataclysmic league  Just over a century ago the island of Krakatoa in Indonesia blew itself out of existence 
That was quite a bang literally the sound of the explosion was heard thousands of miles away  So much volcanic material was blasted into the stratosphere that the world was still being treated to a series of spectacular sunsets more than three years afterwards 
No one knows the height of the tsunami caused by this eruption  What we do know is that much of the three great islands bordering the Java Sea Sumatra Java and Borneo and nearly all of the smaller islands inside the sea itself lie below an altitude of 200 feet 
No tally of the dead has ever been made  It is better perhaps that we do n't know 
And perhaps it 's also better that we do n't know what you 're going to say next Talbot said  I do n't much care for the road you 're leading us along 
I do n't much care for it myself  Benson sighed and sipped some more gin 
Anyone ever heard of the word kalliste  Certainly Denholm said 
Means most beautiful  Very ancient 
Goes back to Homeric times  My goodness 
Benson peered at him through his pipe smoke  I thought you were the electronics officer 
Lieutenant Denholm is primarily a classicist Talbot said  Electronics is one of his hobbies 
Ah  Benson gestured with his thumb 
Kalliste was the name given to this little lady before it became either Thera or Santorini and a more singularly inapt name I can not imagine  It was this beautiful lady that blew her top in 1450 BC with four times the explosively destructive power of Krakatoa 
What had been the cone of a volcano became a circular depression we call it a caldera some thirty square miles in area into which the sea poured  Stirring times gentlemen stirring times 
Unfortunately those stirring times are still with us  Santorini has had and continues to have a very turbulent seismic history 
Incidentally mythology has it that there was an even bigger eruption about 2500 BC  However it has n't done too badly since 1450 BC 
In 236 BC another eruption separated Therasia from north-west Thera  Forty years later the islet of old Jaimeni appeared 
There have been bangs and explosions the appearances and disappearances of islands and volcanoes ever since  In the late sixteenth century the south coast of Thera together with the port of Eleusis vanished under the sea and stayed there 
Even as late as 1956 a considerable earthquake destroyed half the buildings on the west coast of the island  Santorini one fears rests on very shaky foundations 
Talbot said What happened in 1450 BC  Regrettably our ancestors of some thirty-five centuries back do n't seem to have given too much thought to posterity by which I mean they left no records to satisfy their descendants intellectual curiosity 
One can hardly blame them they had too many urgent and pressing matters on hand at the time to worry about such things  According to one account the explosion caused a tidal wave I 65 feet high 
I do n't know who worked this out  I do n't believe it 
It is true that water levels on the Alaskan coast caused by tsunami earthquake-related tidal waves have risen over three hundred feet but this only happens when the sea-bed shallows close inshore in the deep sea although the tsunami can travel tremendously fast two perhaps three hundred miles an hour it 's rarely more than a ripple on the surface of the water  The experts an expert may be loosely defined as any person who claims he knows what he 's talking about are deeply divided as to what happened 
Loggerheads would be too mild a term  It 's an archaeological minefield 
The explosion may have destroyed the Cyclades  It may have wiped out the Minoan civilization in Crete 
It may have swamped the Aegean isles and the coastal lowlands of Greece and Turkey  It may have inundated lower Egypt flooded the Nile and swept back the Red Sea waters to permit the escape of the Israelites fleeing from the Pharaoh 
That 's one view  In 1950 a scientist by the name of Immanuel Velikovsky caused a considerable furore in the historical religious and astronomical worlds by stating unequivocally that the flooding was caused by Venus which had been wrenched free from Jupiter and made an uncomfortably close encounter with earth 
A very scholarly and erudite work widely acclaimed at the time but since much maligned  Professional jealousy 
Upsetting the scientific apple-cart  A charlatan 
Unlikely man was a friend and colleague of Albert Einstein  Then of course there was Edmund Halley he of comet fame he was equally certain that the flooding had been caused by a passing comet 
There 's no doubt there was a huge natural disaster all those millennia ago  As to its cause take your pick your guess is as good as mine 
Reverting to the situation we find ourselves in at this moment there are four facts that can be regarded as certainties or near-certainties  Santorini is about as stable as the proverbial blancmange 
It 's sitting on top of a thermal plume  Thirdly the chances are high that it is sitting atop an ancient tectonic boundary that runs east-west under the Mediterranean this is where the African and Eurasian plates are in contention 
Lastly and indisputably we are sitting atop the equivalent of roughly 200 million tons of TNT  If that goes up I would say it is highly probable in fact think I should use the word inevitable that both the thermal plume and the temporarily quiescent earthquake zone along the tectonic fault would be reactivated 
I leave the rest to your imagination  Benson drained his glass and looked around hopefully 
Talbot pressed a bell  Hawkins said I do n't have that kind of imagination 
None of us has  Fortunately 
We 're talking about the combined and simultaneous effect of a massive thermonuclear detonation a volcanic eruption and an earthquake  This lies out with the experience of mankind so we ca n't visualize those things except to guess and it 's a safe guess that the reality will be worse than any nightmare 
The only consolation of course is that we would n't be around to experience anything nightmare or reality  The extent of potential annihilation beggars belief 
By annihilation I mean the total extinction of life except possibly some subterranean or aquatic forms  What lava volcanic cinders dust and ashes do n't get the blast air percussion waves fire and tsunami will 
If there are any survivors and this could be in an area of thousands of square miles the massive radio-active fall-out will attend to them  It hardly seems necessary to talk about such things as nuclear winters and being fried by ultra-violet radiation 
So you can see Commander Talbot what we mean when we talk about the greatest good of the greatest number  What does it matter if we have two ships or ten out here two hundred men or two thousand 
Every extra man every extra ship may just may be of a tiny percentage more help in neutralizing this damn thing on the sea-floor  What 's even two thousand compared to the unimaginable numbers who might perish if that device does detonate sooner or later almost certainly sooner if we do n't do something about it 
You put things very nicely Professor and you make things very clear  Not that the Ariadne had any intention of going anywhere but it 's nice to have a solid reason to stay put 
Talbot thought briefly  Solves one little problem anyway 
I have six survivors from the yacht Delos aboard and had thought to put three of the innocent parties among them ashore but that seems a little pointless now  Alas yes 
Whether they are aboard here or on Santorini it will be all one to them when they join us in what Lieutenant Denholm is pleased to call vaporized orbit  Talbot lifted a phone asked for a number listened briefly and hung up 
The sonar room  Still tick tick tick 
Ah Benson said  Tick tick tick 
You had an enjoyable tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Mr Andropulos sir  Vice-Admiral Hawkins together with his two scientist friends had just come to the bridge in response to Talbot 's invitation that they join him 
Enjoyable  Ha 
Thank you incidentally for rescuing us  Enjoyable 
Depends what you mean John  I mean were you suitably impressed 
I was suitably unimpressed  Interested mind you but deeply unimpressed 
Man 's character I mean not his quite extraordinary affinity for strong spirits  He comes across as whiter than the driven snow 
A man of such transparent honesty has to have something to hide  And he got his slurring wrong too Benson said 
Slurring sir  Just that Commander 
Thickened his voice in the wrong places to try and convince us that he was under the influence  Maybe he could have got away with it in his native Greek but not in English 
Cold sober I believe  And clever 
Anyway he 's clever enough to hoodwink those two charming young ladies he has with him  I think they 're being hoodwinked 
And his bosom friend Alexander Hawkins said  He 's not so clever 
He comes over as what he might well be a paid-up member if not a capo in the Mafia  He was quite unmoved when I sympathized with them about the loss of the three members of their crew 
Andropulos said he was desolated by the deaths of his treasured friends  Van Gelder had already told us that 
Maybe he was overcome by grief maybe not  In view of the fact that like you I regard him as a fluent liar and consummate actor I think not 
Maybe he is conscience-stricken at having arranged their deaths  Again I think not 
By that I do n't mean he could n't have been responsible for their deaths I just mean that I do n't think he 's on speaking terms with his conscience  Only information I gathered from him is that he abandoned his yacht because he thought his spare fuel tank was going to blow up 
A man of mystery your new-found friend  He 's all that 
Very mysterious  He 's a multi-millionaire 
Maybe a multi-multi-millionaire  Not in the usual Greek line of tankers bottom 's fallen out of that market anyway 
He 's an international businessman with contacts in many countries  Hawkins said Van Gelder told me nothing of this 
' 'Of course he did n't  He did n't know 
Your name attached to a message Admiral is a guarantee of remarkably quick service  Reply received to our query to the Greek Defence Ministry received twenty-five minutes ago 
A businessman  What kind of business 
They did n't say  I knew that would be your question so I immediately radioed a request for that information 
Signed by me of course  Naturally sir 
Had it been a different matter I would of course have asked your permission  But this was the same matter 
The reply came in a few minutes ago listing ten different countries with which he does business  Again what kind of business 
Again they did n't say  Extraordinarily odd 
What do you make of it  The Foreign Minister must have authorized this reply 
Maybe censored it a little  He is of course a member of the government 
I would assume that the mysterious Mr Andropulos has friends in the government  The mysterious Mr Andropulos gets more mysterious by the moment 
Maybe sir  Maybe not not when you consider the list of ten foreign trading partners he has 
Four of them are in cities of what you might regard as being of particular interest Tripoli Beirut Damascus and Baghdad  Indeed 
Hawkins thought briefly  Gun-running 
But of course sir  Nothing illegal about being gun-runners Britain and America are hotching with them 
But all governments are holier-than-thou in this respect and never publicly associate themselves with them  Never do to be classified as a merchant of death 
Could well explain why the Greek government is being so cagey  Indeed it could 
One thing strikes me as odd why is Tehran missing from the list  True true 
The Iranians with the possible exception of the Afghans are more desperate for arms than any other place around  But gun-runners do n't specialize in blowing up planes in flight 
I do n't know what we 're talking about sir  The Hampton Court maze has nothing on this lot 
I have the feeling that it 's going to take us quite some time to figure this out  Fortunately we have more immediate problems to occupy our minds 
Fortunately  Hawkins lifted his eyes heavenwards 
Did you say fortunately  Yes sir 
Vincent  This to Van Gelder 
I should think Jenkins knows the requirements of the Vice-Admiral and his two friends by this time  You are not joining us 
Benson said  Better not 
We expect to be quite busy later on tonight  He turned to Van Gelder again 
And give orders for our six shipwrecked mariners to return to their cabins  They are to remain there until further orders 
Post guards to see that those instructions are obeyed  I think I 'd better go and do this myself sir 
Fine  I 'm all out of tact at the moment 
Hawkins said Do you think they 'll take kindly to this ah incarceration  Incarceration 
Let's call it protective custody  Fact is I do n't want them to see what 's going on in the next few hours 
I 'll explain why in a moment  The Ministry of Defence had another item of information for us 
About the bomber  It had been in touch with air control in Athens and had been instructed to alter course over the island of AmorgÃ³s that 's about forty miles north-east of here and proceed on a roughly north-north-west course 
Two fighter planes US Air Force F15s went up to meet it and escort it in  Did you see any such planes in the vicinity 
No sir  Would n't have expected to 
Rendezvous point was to be over the island of Euboea  The destination was not Athens but Thessalonika 
I assume the Americans have a missile base in that area  I would n't know 
Admiral Blyth on the Apollo has also come through  We 've had luck here two pieces of luck 
A recovery ship en route to Piraeus has been diverted to Santorini  Diving crews recovery gear the lot 
You 'll know it sir  The Kilcharran 
I know it  Auxiliary Fleet vessel 
Nominally under my command  I say nominally because I also have the misfortune to know its captain 
Lad called Montgomery  A very crusty Irishman with a low opinion of Royal Navy regulations 
Not that that matters  He 's brilliant at his job 
Could n't ask to have a better man around  Your other item of good news 
There 's a plane en route to Santorini at this moment with a couple of divers and diving equipment for four aboard  Very experienced men I 'm told a Chief Petty Officer and a Petty Officer 
I 've sent Sub-Lieutenant Cousteau ashore to pick them up  They should be here in half an hour or so 
Excellent excellent  And when do you expect the Kilcharran 
About five in the morning sir  By Jove things are looking up 
You have something in mind  I have 
With your permission sir  Oh do shut up 
Yes sir  It will also answer your two questions why Van Gelder and I are on the wagon and why the six survivors have been well locked up out of harm 's way 
When Cousteau comes back with the divers and equipment Van Gelder and I are going down with them to have a look at this plane  I 'm pretty sure we wo n't be able to accomplish much 
But we 'll be able to assess the extent of the damage to the plane with luck locate this ticking monster and with even greater luck try to free it  I know in advance that we 're not going to have that kind of luck but it 's worth a try 
You 'd be the first to agree sir that in the circumstances anything is worth a try  Yes yes but well you 'll excuse me if I frown a bit but you and Van Gelder are the two most important people on this ship 
No we 're not  If anything should happen to us personally and I do n't see what can happen you are in your spare time so to speak accustomed to commanding a battle fleet 
I can hardly see that a mere frigate is going to inconvenience you to all that extent  And if anything should happen on a catastrophic scale nobody 's going to be worrying too much about anything 
Wickram said You are a cold-blooded so-and-so Commander  Hawkins sighed 
Not cold blood Dr Wickram  Cold logic I 'm afraid 
And when and if you come back up what then  Then we 're off to have a look at the Delos 
Should be very interesting  Andropulos may have made a mistake Admiral in telling you that he was scared that his spare fuel tank might blow up 
But then he could have had no idea that we were going to have a look at the Delos  That 's why he 's locked up 
I do n't want him to know we 've got divers aboard and I especially do n't want him to see me taking off with divers in the general direction of the Delos  If we find that there was no spare tank we shall have to keep an even closer eye on him 
And for good measure on his dear friend Alexander and his captain Aristotle  I ca n't believe that that young seaman Achmed or whatever his name is or either of the two girls can have anything to do with this 
I think they 're along for the purpose of camouflage respectability if you will  In any event we should be back long before the Kilcharran arrives 
He turned to look at Denholm who had just arrived on the bridge  Well Jimmy what drags you away from the fleshpots 
If I may say so with some dignity sir I 'm trying to set them an example  I 've just had a thought sir 
If you will excuse me Admiral  I think that any thought you might have could be well worth listening to young man 
Not Greek literature this time I 'll be bound  This ah hobby of yours 
Electronics is it not  Well yes it is sir 
Denholm seemed faintly surprised  He looked at Talbot 
That atom bomb down there the one that goes tick tick tick  The intention is or the hope anyway to detach it from the other explosives 
If it can be done  And then sir 
One thing at a time Jimmy  That 's as far as my thinking has got so far 
Would we try to de-activate it  Denholm looked at Wickram 
Do you think it could be de-activated sir  I honestly do n't know Lieutenant 
I have powerful suspicions but I just do n't know  I should have imagined that this lay more in your field than mine 
Electronics I mean  I know how to build those damned weapons but I know nothing about those fancy triggering devices 
Neither do I. Not without knowing how they work  For that I 'd have to see the blueprint a diagrammatic layout 
You said you had powerful suspicions  What suspicions sir 
I suspect that it ca n't be de-activated  In fact I 'm certain the process is irreversible 
The second suspicion is also a certainty  I 'm damn sure that I 'm not going to be the one to try 
That makes two of us  So what other options are open to us 
Benson said May a total ignoramus venture an opinion  Why do n't we take it to some safe place a hundred miles away and dump it at the bottom of the deep blue sea 
A tempting thought Professor Denholm said but not a very practicable one  It is of course a hundred per cent certain that this triggering device is battery-powered 
The latest generation of Nife cells can lie dormant for months even years and still spring smartly to attention when called on to do their duty  You ca n't declare a whole area of the Mediterranean off-limits to all shipping for years to come 
I prefaced my suggestion by saying that I was an ignoramus  Well in for a penny in for a pound 
Another doubtlessly ludicrous suggestion  We take it to the self-same spot and detonate it 
Denholm shook his head  I 'm afraid that still leaves us with a couple of problems 
The first is how are we going to get it there  We take it there 
Yes  We take it there 
Or we set out to take it there  Then somewhere en route the ticking stops 
Then the triggering device cocks its ear and says Aha  What 's this I hear 
Ship 's engines and detonates  There would n't even be a second 's warning 
Had n't thought of that  We could I say this hopefully tow it there 
Our little friend is still listening and we do n't know and have no means of knowing how sensitive its hearing is  Engines of course would set it off 
So would a generator  A derrick winch even a coffee-grinder in the galley might provide all the impulse it requires 
Talbot said You came all the way up to the bridge Jimmy just to spread sweetness and light your own special brand of Job 's comfort  Not quite sir 
It 's just that a couple of ideas occurred to me one of which will have occurred to you and one which you probably do n't know about  Getting the bomb to its destination would be easy enough 
We use a sailing craft  Lots of them hereabouts 
Aegean luggers  Talbot looked at Hawkins 
One ca n't think of everything  I forgot to mention sir that in addition to being a student of ancient Greek language and literature Lieutenant Denholm is also a connoisseur of the small craft of the Aegean 
Used to spend all his summers here well until we nabbed him that is  I would n't begin to know how to sail those luggers or caiques in fact I could n't even sail a dinghy if you paid me 
But I 've studied them yes  Most of them come from the island of Samos or Bodrum in Turkey 
Before the war the First World War that is they were all sailing craft  Nowadays they 're nearly all engined most of them with steadying sails 
But there 's quite a few both with engines and a full set of sails  Those are the Trehandiri and Perama types and I know there are some in the Cyclades 
One of those would be ideal for our purposes  Because they have shallow keels a minimum draught and no ballast they are almost useless performers to windward but that would n't matter in this case 
The prevailing wind here is north-west and the open sea lies to the south-east  Useful information to have Talbot said 
Very useful indeed  Um you would n't happen to know anyone with such a craft 
As a matter of fact I do  Good God 
You 're as useful as your information  Talbot broke off as Van Gelder entered the bridge 
Duty done Number One  Yes sir 
Andropulos was a bit reluctant to go  So were Alexander and Aristotle 
In fact they point-blank refused to go  Infringement of their liberties as Greek civilians or some tosh to that effect 
Demanded to know on whose orders  I said yours 
Demanded to see you  I said in the morning 
More outrage  I did n't argue with them just called up McKenzie and some of his merry men who removed them forcibly 
I told McKenzie not to post any guards just lock the doors and pocket the keys  You 're going to hear from the Greek government about this sir 
Excellent  Wish I 'd been there 
And the girls  Sweet reason 
No problem  Fine 
Now Jimmy you said a couple of ideas had occurred to you  What was the second one 
It 's about the second problem that the Professor raised  The detonation 
We could of course try sympathetic detonation by dropping a depth charge on it but as we would be in the immediate vicinity at the time I do n't think that would be a very good idea  Neither do I. So 
The Pentagon could have the answer  Despite feeble denials to the contrary everyone knows that the Pentagon controls NASA the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
NASA in turn is supposed to administer the Kennedy Space Center  Supposed is the operative word 
They do n't  The centre is operated by EG & G a major defence contractor 
EG & G Dr Wickram will know much more about this than I do oversees such things as nuclear-weapons tests and the so-called Star Wars  More importantly they are developing or have developed what they call the krytron a remote-controlled electronic impulse trigger that can detonate nuclear weapons 
A word from the Admiral in the ear of the Pentagon might work wonders  Hawkins cleared his throat 
This little titbit of information Lieutenant  It will of course like your other titbits be in the public domain 
It is sir  You astonish me 
Most interesting most  Could be a big part of the answer to our problem do n't you agree Commander 
Talbot nodded  I think we should act immediately on this one 
Ah  The very man himself 
Myers had just entered carrying a piece of paper which he handed to Talbot  Reply to your latest query to the Pentagon sir 
Thank you  No do n't go 
We 'll have another message to send them in a minute  Talbot handed the paper to Hawkins 
'Security at bomber base Hawkins read believed to be 99.9% effective  But cards on the table 
However unlikely there may be one chance in ten thousand that security has been penetrated  This could have been that one chance 
Well is n't that nice  Absolutely useless piece of information of course 
'Plane carried fifteen H-bombs of fifteen megatons each and three atom bombs all three equipped with timing devices  Well that 's just fine 
So now we have three of those ticking monsters to contend with  With any luck just one Talbot said 
Sonar picks up only one  Extremely unlikely that all three would be ticking in perfect unison 
Point 's academic anyway  One or a hundred the big boys would still go up 
Identified by size they say Hawkins went on  Sixty inches by six 
Pretty small for an atom bomb I would have thought  4000 kilotons 
That 's a lot Dr Wickram  By today 's standards peanuts 
Less than half the size of the Hiroshima bomb  If the bomb is the dimensions they say then it 's very large for such a small explosive value 
It goes on to say that they 're designated for marine use  I suppose that 's a fancy way of saying that they are mines 
So your guess was right Dr Wickram  Also explains the size of the bomb 
Quite a bit of space will be taken up by the timing mechanism and of course it will have to be weighted to give it negative buoyancy  The real sting comes in the tail Hawkins said 
When the ticking stops the timing clock has run out and the firing mechanism is activated and ready to be triggered by mechanical stimulation by which I take it they mean ship 's engines  So it looks as if you were right about that one Van Gelder 
Then by way of cheerful farewell they say that enquiries so far confirm that the timing mechanism once in operation can not be neutralized and appears to be irreversible  The last words were met with silence 
No one had any comment to make for the excellent reason that everyone had already been convinced of the fact  A message to the Pentagon Myers 
Urgently require to know state of development of the EG & G krytron that 's k-r-y-t-r-o-n is n't it Lieutenant nuclear detonation device  Talbot paused 
Add If operating model exists essential dispatch immediately with instructions  That do Admiral 
Hawkins nodded  Sign it Admiral Hawkins 
We must be giving them quite some headaches in the Pentagon Hawkins said in some satisfaction  This should call for still more aspirin 
Aspirins are not enough Van Gelder said  Sleepless nights are what are called for 
You have something in mind Van Gelder  Yes sir 
They can have no idea of the really horrendous potential of the situation here in Santorini the combination of all those megatons of hydrogen bombs thermal plumes and volcanoes and earthquakes along the tectonic plate boundaries and the possibly cataclysmic results  If Professor Benson here were to make a very brief precis of the lecture he gave us in the wardroom this evening it might give them something more to think about 
You have an evil mind Van Gelder  What a perfectly splendid suggestion 
Uneasy will lie the heads along the Potomac this night  What do you think Professor 
It will be a pleasure  When Sub-Lieutenant Cousteau together with the two divers and their equipment returned from Santorini they found the Ariadne in virtual darkness 
With the thought of the malevolent listening bug on the sea-floor dominating every other in his mind Talbot had sought Lieutenant Denholm 's advice on the question of noise suppression Denholm had not been half-hearted in his recommendations with the result that the use of all mechanical devices on the ship from generators to electric shavers had been banned  Only essential lighting radar sonar and radio were functioning normally all these could function equally well as they had been designed to do on battery power 
The sonar watch on the ticking device in the crashed bomber was now continuous  The two divers Chief Petty Officer Carrington and Petty Officer Grant were curiously alike both aged about thirty of medium height and compact build both were much given to smiling a cheerfulness that in no way detracted from their almost daunting aura of competence 
They were with Talbot and Van Gelder in the wardroom  That 's all I know about the situation down there Talbot said and heaven knows it 's little enough 
I just want to know those three things the extent of the damage the location of this ticking noise and to see if it 's possible to remove this atom bomb or whatever which I 'm convinced in advance is impossible  You are aware of the dangers and you are aware that I can not order you to do this 
How does the prospect appeal Chief  It does n't appeal at all sir 
Carrington was imperturbable  Neither Bill Grant nor I is cast in the heroic mould 
We 'll walk very softly down there  You should n't be worrying about us you should be worrying about what your crew is thinking 
If we slip up they 'll all join us in the wide blue yonder or whatever  I know you want to come down sir but is it really necessary 
We 're pretty experienced in moving around inside wrecks without banging into things and we 're both Torpedo Gunner Mates and explosives you might say are our business  Not I admit the kind of explosives you have down there but we know enough not to trigger a bomb by accident 
And we might  Talbot smiled 
You 're very tactful Chief  What you mean is that we might bang into things or kick a detonator on the nose or something of the kind 
When you say necessary do you mean wise  I refer to our diving experience or lack of it 
We know about your diving experience sir  You will understand that when we knew what we were coming into we made some discreet enquiries 
We know that you have commanded a submarine and the Lieutenant-Commander was your first lieutenant  We know you 've both been through the HMS Dolphin Submarine Escape Tower and that you 've done more than a fair bit of free diving 
No we do n't think you 'll be getting in our way or banging things around  Carrington turned up palms in acceptance 
What 's your battery capacity sir  For essential and non-mechanical purposes ample 
Several days  We 'll put down three weighted floodlights and suspend them about twenty feet above the bottom 
That should illuminate the plane nicely  We 'll have a powerful hand-flash each 
We have a small bag of tools for cutting sawing and snipping  We also have an oxyacetylene torch which is rather more difficult to use under water than most people imagine but as this is just a reconnaissance trip we wo n't be taking it along 
The closed-circuit breathing is of the type we prefer fifty-fifty oxygen and nitrogen with a carbon dioxide scrubber  At the depth of a hundred feet which is what we will be at we could easily remain underwater for an hour without any risk of either oxygen poisoning or decompression illness 
That 's academic of course  Provided there 's access to the plane and the fuselage is not crushed a few minutes should tell us all we want to know 
Two points about the helmet  There 's a rotary chin switch which you depress to activate an amplifier that lets us talk visor to visor 
A second press cuts it off  It also has a couple of sockets over the ears where you can plug in what is to all effects a stethoscope 
That 's all  All 
We can go now  A last check sir 
Carrington did n't have to specify what check  Talbot lifted a phone spoke briefly and replaced it 
Our friend is still at work  The water was warm and still and so very clear that they could see the lights of the suspended arc-lamps even before they dipped below the surface of the darkened Aegean 
With Carrington in the lead and using the marker buoy anchor rope as a guide they slid down fifty feet and stopped  The three arc-lamps had come to rest athwart the sunken bomber sharply illuminating the fuselage and the two wings 
The left wing though still attached to the fuselage had been almost completely sheared off between the inner engine and the fuselage and was angled back about thirty degrees from normal  The tail unit had been almost completely destroyed 
The fuselage or that part of it that could be seen from above appeared to be relatively intact  The nose cone of the plane was shrouded in shadow 
They continued their descent until their feet touched the top of the fuselage half-walked half-swam until they reached the front of the plane switched on their flash-lights and looked through the completely shattered windows of the cockpit  The pilot and the co-pilot were still trapped in their seats 
They were no longer men just the vestigial remains of what had once been human beings  Death must have been instantaneous 
Carrington looked at Talbot and shook his head then dropped down to the sea-bed in front of the nose cone  The hole that had been blasted there was roughly circular with buckled and jagged edges projecting outwards conclusive proof that the blast had been internal the diameter of the whole was approximately five feet 
Moving slowly and cautiously so as not to rip any of the rubber components of their diving suits they passed in file into a compartment not more than four feet in height but almost twenty feet in length extending from the nose cone under the flight deck and then several feet beyond  Both sides of the compartment were lined with machinery and metal boxes so crushed and mangled that their original function was incomprehensible 
Two-thirds of the way along the compartment a hatch had been blasted upwards  The opening led to a space directly behind the seats of the two pilots 
Aft of this was what was left of a small radio-room with a man who appeared to be peacefully sleeping leaning forward on folded arms the fingers of one hand still on a transmitting key  Beyond this four short steps led down to an oval door let into a solid steel bulkhead 
The door was secured by eight clamps some of which had been jammed into position by the impact of the blast  A hammer carried by Carrington in his canvas bag of tools soon tapped them into a loosened position 
Beyond the door lay the cargo compartment bare bleak functional and obviously designed for one purpose only the transport of missiles  These were secured by heavy steel clamps which were in turn bolted to longitudinal reinforced steel beams let into the floor and sides of the fuselage 
There was oil mixed with the water in the compartment but even in the weird swirling yellowish light they looked neither particularly menacing nor sinister  Slender graceful with either end encased in a rectangular metal box they looked perfectly innocuous 
Each contained fifteen megatons of high explosive  There were six of those in the first section of the compartment 
As a formality and not because of any expectations Talbot and Carrington applied their stethoscopes to each cylinder in turn  The results were negative as they had known they would be Dr Wickram had been positive that they contained no timing devices 
There were also six missiles in the central compartment  Three of these were of the same size as those in the front compartment the other three were no more than five feet in length 
Those had to be the atom bombs  It was when he was testing the third of those with his stethoscope that Carrington beckoned to Talbot who came and listened in turn 
He did n't have to listen long  The two and a half second ticking sequence sounded exactly as it had done in the sonar room 
In the aft compartment they went through the routine exercise of listening to the remaining six missiles and found what they had expected nothing  Carrington put his visor close to Talbot 's 
Enough  Enough 
That did n't take you long Hawkins said  Long enough to find out what we needed 
Missiles are there all present and correct as listed by the Pentagon  Only one bomb has been activated 
Three dead men  That 's all except for the most important fact of all 
The bomber crashed because of an internal explosion  Some kindly soul had concealed a bomb under the flight deck 
The Pentagon must be glad that they added the faint possibility that there was one chance in ten thousand that security might be breached  The faint possibility came true 
Raises some fascinating questions does n't it sir  Who 
What  Why 
When  We do n't have to ask where because we already know that 
I do n't want to sound grim or vindictive Hawkins said because I 'm not  Well maybe a little 
Should cut the gentlemen on Foggy Bottom or wherever down to size and make them a mite more civil and cooperative in future  Not only is it an American plane that is responsible for the dreadful situation in which we find ourselves but it was someone in America who was ultimately responsible 
if they ever do discover who was responsible and it 's not without the bounds of possibility it 's going to cause an awful lot of red faces and I 'm not just referring to the villain himself  I 'd lay odds that the person responsible is an insider a pretty high-up insider with free access to secret information such as closely guarded secrets as to the composition of the cargo the destination and the time of take-off and arrival 
Would n't you agree Commander  I do n't see how it can be otherwise 
Not a problem I 'd care to have on my hands  However that 's their problem 
We have an even bigger problem on our hands  True true 
Hawkins sighed  What 's the next step then 
In recovering this damn bomb I mean  I think you should ask Chief Petty Officer Carrington sir not me 
He and Petty Officer Grant are the experts  It 's a tricky one sir Carrington said 
Cutting away a fuselage section large enough to lift the bomb through is straightforward enough  But before we could lift the bomb out we would have to free it from its clamps and this is where the great difficulty lies 
Those clamps are made of high-tensile steel fitted with a locking device  For that we need a key and we do n't know where the key is 
It could be Hawkins said that the key is held at the missile base where the bombs were due to be delivered  With respect sir I think that unlikely 
Those clamps had to be locked at the Air Force base where they were loaded So they would have to have a key there  I think it would be much easier and more logical if they just took the key with them 
Trouble is a key is a very small thing and that 's a very big bomber indeed  If there 's no key there are two ways we can remove that clamp 
One is chemical using either a metal softener or corrosive  The metal softener is used by stage magicians who go in for spoon-bending and such-like 
Magicians  Hawkins said 
Charlatans you mean  Whatever 
The principle is the same  They use a colourless paste which has no effect on the skin but has the peculiar property of altering the molecular structure of a metal and making it malleable 
A corrosive is simply a powerful acid that eats through steel  Lots of them on the market 
But in this case both softeners and corrosives have one impossible drawback you ca n't use them underwater  Hawkins said You mentioned two ways of removing the clamp 
What 's the other  Oxyacetylene torch sir 
Make short work of any clamp  It would also I imagine make even shorter work of the operator 
Those torches generate tremendous heat and I should also imagine that anyone who even contemplates using an oxyacetylene torch on an atom bomb is an obvious candidate for the loony-bin  Hawkins looked at Wickram 
Comment  No comment 
Not on the unthinkable  I speak in no spirit of complaint Carrington Hawkins said but you 're not very encouraging 
What you are about to suggest of course is that we wait for the Kilcharran to come along and hoist the damn thing to the surface  Yes sir 
Carrington hesitated  But there 's a snag even to that 
A snag  Talbot said 
You are referring of course to the distinct and unpleasant possibility that the ticking might stop while the Kilcharran 's winch engine is working overtime at hauling the bomber to the surface  I mean just that sir 
A trifle  There are no trifles that the combined brain-power aboard the Ariadne ca n't solve 
He turned to Denholm  You can fix that Lieutenant 
Yes sir  How sir 
There was a pardonable note of doubt if not outright disbelief in Carrington 's voice Lieutenant Denholm did n't look like the type of person who could fix anything  Talbot smiled 
If I may say this gently Chief one does not question Lieutenant Denholm on those matters  He knows more about electrics and electronics than any man in the Mediterranean 
It 's quite simple Chief Denholm said  We just couple up the combined battery powers of the Ariadne and the Kilcharran 
The Kilcharran 's winches arc probably diesel-powered  We may or may not be able to convert them to electrical use 
If we ca n't it does n't matter  We have excellent electric anchor windlasses on the Ariadne 
Yes but well with one of your two anchors out of commission you 'd start drifting would n't you  We would n't drift 
A diving ship normally carries four splayed anchors to moor it precisely over any given spot on the ocean floor  We just tie up to the Kilcharran that 's all 
I 'm not doing too well am I  One last objection sir 
Probably a feeble one  An anchor is only an anchor 
This bomber and its cargo probably weighs over a hundred tons  I mean it 's quite a lift 
Diving ships also carry flotation bags  We strap them to the plane 's fuselage and pump them full of compressed air until we achieve neutral buoyancy 
I give up Carrington said  From now on I stick to diving 
So we twiddle our thumbs until the Kilcharran arrives Hawkins said  But not you I take it Commander 
I think we 'll have a look at the Delos sir  They had rowed about a mile when Talbot called up the Ariadne 
He spoke briefly listened briefly then turned to McKenzie who was at the tiller  Ship oars 
The timing device is still at it so I think we 'll start the engine  Gently at first 
At this distance I hardly think we 'd trigger anything even if the bomb was activated but no chances  Course 095 
There were nine of them in the whaler Talbot Van Gelder the two divers McKenzie and the four seamen who had rowed them so far  Those last would not be required again until they reached the last mile of the return trip 
After about forty minutes Van Gelder moved up into the bows with a portable six-inch searchlight which on such a clear night had an effective range of over a mile  The search-light was probably superfluous for there was a three-quarter moon and Talbot with his night-glasses had a clear bearing on the monastery and the radar station on Mount Elias 
Van Gelder returned within minutes and handed the searchlight to McKenzie  Fine off the port bow Chief 
I have it McKenzie said  The yellow buoy in the light of both the moon and the searchlight was clearly visible 
Do I anchor  Not necessary Talbot said 
No current that 's worth speaking of no wind a heavy anchor weight and a stout anchor rope  Just make fast to the buoy 
In course of time McKenzie did just that and the four divers slipped over the side touching down on the deck of the Delos just over an hour after leaving the Ariadne  Carrington and Grant disappeared down the for'ard companionway while Talbot and Van Gelder took the after one 
Talbot did n't bother entering the after stateroom  The two girls had stayed there and he knew it would hold nothing of interest for him 
He looked at the dead engineer or the man whom Van Gelder had taken to be the engineer because of his blue overalls and examined the back of his head carefully  The occiput had not been crushed and there were no signs of either bruising or blood in the vicinity of the deep gash in the skin of the skull 
He rejoined Van Gelder who had already moved into the engine-room  There was of course no smoke there now and very little traces of oil 
In the light of their two powerful flashlights visibility was all that could be wished for and it took them only two minutes to carry out their examination unless one is looking for some obscure mechanical fault there is very little to look for in an engine-room  On their way out they opened up a tool-box and took out a long slender chisel apiece 
They found the bridge when they arrived there to be all that they would have expected a bridge on such a yacht to be with a plethora of expensive and largely unnecessary navigational aids but in all respects perfectly innocuous  Only one thing took Talbot 's attention a wooden cupboard on the after bulkhead 
It was locked but on the understandable assumption that Andropulos would n't be having any further use for it Talbot wrenched it open with a chisel  It contained the ship 's papers and ship 's log nothing more 
A door on the port side of the same bulkhead led to a combined radio-room and chart-room  The chart-room section held nothing that a chart-room should not have had including a locked cupboard which Talbot opened in the same cavalier fashion he had used on the bridge it held only pilot books and sailing directions 
Andropulos it seemed just liked locking cupboards  The radio was a standard RCA 
They left  They found Carrington and Grant waiting for them in the saloon 
Carrington was carrying what appeared to be a portable radio Grant had a black metallic box slightly larger than a sheet of foolscap paper and less than three inches thick  Carrington put his visor dose to Talbot 's 
All we could find  Of interest I mean 
We have enough  Dispatch would appear to be the keynote of your investigations Commander Hawkins said 
Glass in hand he was seated across the wardroom table from Talbot  I mean you seem to spend singularly little time on your um aquatic investigation 
You can find out interesting things in a very short space of time sir  Too much for some people 
You refer to our shipwrecked friends  Who else 
Five things sir  Van Gelder was right there were no signs of bruising or blood where the engineer had been gashed on the head 
An examination of the engine-room turned up no signs of protrusions angle-beams or sharp metallic corners that could have caused the injury  Circumstantial evidence I know but evidence that strongly suggests that the engineer was clobbered by a heavy metallic instrument 
No shortage of those in an engine-room  We have of course no clue as to the identity of the assailant 
Secondly I 'm afraid the owner of the Delos has been guilty of telling you fibs Admiral  He said he abandoned the Delos because he was afraid that the reserve fuel tank might blow up 
There is no such tank  Is n't that interesting 
Does make things look a little black for Andropulos  It does a bit 
He could always claim of course that he knew nothing of the layout of the engine-room and had always assumed that there had to be a reserve tank or that in a panic-stricken concern for the welfare of his beloved niece he had quite forgotten that there was no such tank  He 's undoubtedly intelligent we know he 's a thespian of some note and could put up a spirited and convincing defence in court 
But he 'd have no defence against a further charge that the explosion was not due to natural causes unless you regard the detonation of a bomb almost certainly a plastic explosive under the main fuel tank as being a natural cause  Well well well 
One wonders how he 'll talk his way out of this one  You 're quite certain of course 
We are wounded sir Van Gelder said  The Captain and I are developing quite some expertise on the effects of explosives on metal 
In the bomber the metal of the fuselage was blown outwards in this case the metal of the fuel tank was blown inwards  We are not explosives experts sir Talbot said 
But it would seem that Andropulos was n't either  He nodded towards Carrington and Grant 
But those two gentlemen are experts  We were talking about it on the way back 
They reckon that Andropulos if it was Andropulos it could have been Alexander or Aristotle made an amateurish blunder  They say the villain whoever he was should have used what they call an inverted beehive plastic explosive attached to the underside of the tank by a magnetic damp in which case more than ninety per cent of the explosive charge would have been directed upwards 
It would seem that they did n't use such a device  Hawkins looked at Carrington 
You can be sure of this Chief  As sure as can be sir 
We do know that he could n't have used a beehive  The explosive charge would have been either flat circular or cylindrical and in any of those cases the disruptive explosive power would have been uniformly distributed in all directions 
Grant and I think he did n't deliberately sink the yacht but that he just through ignorance kind of accidentally blew a hole through the bottom  If it were n't for the three dead men this could be almost amusing 
As it is one has to admit that life is full of its little ironies  What 's that you 've got in front of you there Carrington 
Some sort of radio sir  Took it from the captain 's cabin 
Why did you take it  Struck me as odd sir unusual out of place you might say 
Every cabin is fitted with its own bulkhead radio all probably fed from the central radio in the saloon  So why should he require this additional radio especially when he had access to and was probably the only user of the much superior radio in his radio-room 
Talbot looked at Denholm  Just a standard radio is it 
Not quite  Denholm took the radio and examined it briefly 
A transceiver which means it can transmit as well as receive  Hundreds of them around thousands most commonly as ship-to-shore radios in private yachts 
Also used in geological and seismological work and construction building  Remote control detonation 
He paused and looked around myopically  I do n't want to sound sinister but it could equally well be used to trigger off the detonator in an explosive device being carried by an American Air Force bomber 
There was a brief silence then Hawkins said I do n't want to complain Denholm but you do rather tend to complicate matters  I used the word could sir not did 
On the whole given the mysterious and inexplicable circumstances I rather think I prefer the word did  If that is the case it leads of course to even more mysteries 
How did Andropulos or whoever know when and from where that bomber was leaving  How did he know its cargo 
How did he know an explosive device was being smuggled aboard  How did he know the radio wavelength to set it off 
And of course there 's the why why why  The silence was considerably longer this time 
Finally Hawkins said Maybe we 're doing Andropulos an injustice  Maybe Alexander is the mastermind 
Not a chance sir  Van Gelder was definite 
Andropulos lied about the spare tank  He has connections with main centres of known gun-running activities 
The fact that Alexander who unquestionably plays the role of assistant villain had the radio in his cabin is of no significance  I should imagine that Irene Charial might be in the habit of dropping in on her uncle occasionally and he would n't want her saying Whatever are you doing with a spare radio in your cabin Uncle 
I can hardly imagine her dropping in on Alexander at any time far less occasionally  So Alexander kept the radio 
You mentioned the possibility of an insider at this Air Force base in America sir Talbot said  I think we should be thinking in terms of a whole platoon of insiders 
You will be composing messages for the Pentagon Air Force Intelligence and the CIA  Suitably etched in acid 
I think by this time they must be dreading the thought of another signal from the Ariadne  I do n't see much point in your going to Washington and entering a popularity stakes contest 
The slings and arrows well we 're accustomed to injustices  What do you have in that box 
Petty Officer Grant picked this up in Andropulos 's cabin  Have n't opened it yet 
Not without difficulty he undid two spring clips and lifted the lid  Waterproof by Jove 
He looked at the contents  Means nothing to me 
Hawkins took the box from him lifted out some sheets of paper and a paperback book examined them briefly and shook his head  Means nothing to me either 
Denholm  Denholm shuffled through the papers 
In Greek naturally  Looks like a list of names addresses and telephone numbers to me 
But I ca n't make sense of it  I thought you understood Greek 
I do  But I do n't understand Grecian code 
And this is what it 's written in a code  Code 
Damn it to hell  Hawkins spoke with considerable feeling 
This could be urgent  Vital 
It 's more than likely sir  Denholm looked at the paperback 
Homer 's Odyssey  I do n't suppose it 's here just by coincidence 
If we knew the connection between the poem and what 's written on those sheets then cracking the code would be child 's play  But we do n't have the key 
That 's locked away inside Andropulos 's mind  Anagrams and word puzzles are not in my line of country sir 
I 'm no cryptologist  Hawkins looked moodily at Talbot 
You do n't have a code-cracker among this motley crew you have aboard  To the best of my knowledge no 
And certainly not a Greek code-cracker  Should n't be too difficult to find one I should imagine 
The Greek Defence Ministry and their Secret Service are bound to have some cryptologists on their staffs  Just a radio call and a half-hour 's flight away sir 
Hawkins glanced at his watch  Two a.m 
All God-fearing cryptologists are tucked up in their beds by this time  So are all God-fearing admirals Denholm said 
Besides my friend Wotherspoon did n't mind being rousted out of bed an hour ago  Positively cheerful about it in fact 
Talbot said Who may I ask warily is Wotherspoon  Professor Wotherspoon 
My friend with the Aegean lugger  You asked me to contact him remember 
Lives in Naxos seven or eight hours sail from here  He 's on his way with the Angelina 
Very civil of him I must say  Angelina 
Odd name  Better not let him hear you say that sir 
Name of his lugger  Ancient and honoured Grecian name some sort of classical goddess I believe 
Also the name of his wife  Charming lady 
Is he what shall we say slightly eccentric  All depends upon what you mean by eccentric 
He regards the rest of the world as being slightly eccentric  A professor 
What does he profess  Archaeology 
Used to  He 's retired now 
Retired  Oh dear 
I mean have we any right to bring an elderly archaeologist into this  Do n't let him hear you say that either sir 
He 's not elderly  Old man left him a fortune 
You warned him of the perils of course  As directly as I could 
Seemed amused  Said his ancestors fought at Agincourt and Crecy 
Something to that effect  What 's good enough for a retired archaeologist should be good enough for a Greek cryptologist Hawkins said 
Not that I follow the logic of that  If you would be so good Commander 
We 'll radio Athens right away  Two things sir 
I suggest we release Andropulos and his friends for breakfast and leave them free  Sure we 've got plenty on them but as yet no conclusive proof and the three A's Andropulos Aristotle and Alexander are a close-mouthed and secretive lot and we can be certain they wo n't talk to us or give anything away 
But they might just might talk among themselves  Lieutenant Denholm will lurk unobtrusively 
They do n't and wo n't know that he talks Greek as well as they do  Number One would you tell McKenzie to warn the four seamen who were with us tonight that they are on no account to mention the fact that we were on the Delos 
Keel-hauling walking the plank that sort of thing  One other thing 
The presence of the cryptographer when he arrives will not go unnoticed  He 's not a cryptographer Van Gelder said 
Peace be to Lieutenant Denholm but he 's a civilian electronics specialist who 's come out to fix some abstruse electronic fault that only he can fix  Also gives a splendid reason for him to use Denholm 's cabin while he gets on with his decoding 
Well thank you very much  Denholm smiled and turned to Talbot 
With the Captain 's permission I 'd like to retire there right now and get some sleep before this impostor arrives  An excellent idea 
Vice-Admiral Hawkins Professor Benson Dr Wickram I suggest you follow his example  I promise you we 'll give you a shake if anything untoward occurs 
Another excellent idea Hawkins said  After our nightcap 
And after you 've sent your signal to Athens and I 've composed a suitably stirring message to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington  Stirring 
Certainly  Why should I be the only one suffering from insomnia 
I shall tell him that we have every reason to believe that the bomber was carrying a smuggled explosive device aboard that its detonation was triggered by a radio wave and that we have the miscreant responsible in our hands  Reason to believe not proof 
I shall name Andropulos  I shall want to know how he knew when and from where that bomber was taking off 
How did he know what it was carrying  How could this explosive device possibly have been smuggled aboard 
How did he know the radio wavelength to set it off  I shall suggest that our concern should be made immediately known to the White House Air Force Intelligence the CIA and the FBI 
I will suggest that Andropulos has been provided with top-level ultra-secret information from a very senior official  I will suggest that this should considerably narrow their field of search 
I will further suggest that it seems very likely that the traitor is in his own fiefdom the Pentagon  Stirring indeed 
Laying it on the line as you might say  Talbot paused 
It has occurred to you Admiral Hawkins that you might also be laying your own career on the line  Only if I 'm wrong 
Only if we 're wrong  In the circumstances a bagatelle 
You would do exactly the same thing  Five o'clock sir 
Talbot woke in his sea-cabin abaft the bridge to find Van Gelder bending over him  The Kilcharran is three miles out 
What 's the latest word from sonar  Still ticking away sir 
Captain Montgomery says he 's going to shut down his engines in another half-mile  Sees us clearly and reckons he 'll come to a stop more or less alongside 
He says that if he 's going to overshoot he 'll use a sea anchor or drop a stern anchor and if he stops short of us he 'll send a crew with a rope  From the way he talks he seems to regard either possibility as a remote contingency 
Does n't seem the shy or bashful type  I gathered as much from the admiral 
Has our cryptologist arrived  Yes 
Calls himself Theodore  Speaks perfect English but I suppose he 's Greek 
Installed in Denholm 's cabin  Denholm himself is up in the wardroom trying to resume his slumbers 
Van Gelder broke off to accept a sheet of paper from a seaman who had appeared in the doorway glanced briefly at the message and handed it without a word to Talbot who read it in turn muttered something inaudible and swung his legs to the deck  He 'll have to try to resume his slumbers later on 
Tell him to join us in the admiral 's cabin at once  A pyjama-clad Vice-Admiral Hawkins propped up on the pillows of his bunk glowered at the message in his hand and passed it across to Denholm 
Pentagon  Unsigned 
This krytron device you suggested  If I were the spluttering type which I 'm not this would be a sure fire-starter 
Denholm re-read the message  'Understand krytron experimental device in hand 
Endeavour expedite soonest clearance  Gobbledygook sir 
Writer is ignorant or stupid or thinks he 's clever  Very likely all three at once 
What does he mean endeavour  He can either do it or not 
What does he mean understand  He either knows or not 
Expedite  Means to try to hurry things along 
The Pentagon does n't expedite they demand immediate compliance  Same goes for that meaningless word soonest 
Again should be immediate  Clearance by whom 
The Pentagon can clear anything they want  What do they mean experimental 
Either it works or it does n't  And does n't the phrase in hand have a splendid meaningless vagueness about it 
Gobbledygook sir  Jimmy 's right sir Talbot said 
It 's insulting  Stalling for time 
What they 're saying in effect is that they 're not going to entrust their latest toy to their closest ally because we 'd flog it to the first Russian we came across  It 's rich Denholm said 
It 's really wonderful  The Americans positively force their Stinger surface-to-air missiles on the rebels who are fighting the Marxist regime in Angola and the Contras in Nicaragua 
It 's no secret that those guerrilla bands contain a fair proportion of characters who are just as undesirable as the dictatorial governments they 're supposed to be fighting and who would have no hesitation in disposing of those $60,000 missiles at a fraction of their cost to any passing terrorists who in turn would have no hesitation in loosing off one of those missiles at a passing Boeing 747 preferably one packed with five hundred American citizens  But that 's perfectly OK for the American administration 's ad hoc knee-jerk set of reactions that passes for their foreign policy 
But it 's unthinkable that they should allow the krytron into the hands of their oldest ally  It makes me sick 
It makes me mad Hawkins said  Let us give them a lesson on clear and unequivocal English 
Unsigned message received  Meaningless mumbo-jumbo designed to stall and delay 
Demand immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate dispatch of krytron or immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate explanation of why not available  Sender of message and person responsible for delay in clearance will be held directly responsible for possible deaths of thousands 
Can you not imagine the world-wide reaction when it is learnt that not only is America responsible for this potential disaster but that it was almost certainly caused by treason in the highest American military echelons  A copy of this message is being sent directly to the President of the United States 
That do you think  You could have pitched it a bit more strongly sir Talbot said but I 'd have to spend the rest of the night thinking how 
You spoke earlier of sleepless heads along the Potomac  I think we should now talk of heads rolling along the Potomac 
If I were you sir I 'd keep clear of Washington for some little time by which I mean the rest of your life  He rose 
The Kilcharran will be alongside in a few minutes  I assume you are in no hurry to meet Captain Montgomery 
You assume right  There is no charity in me 
He looked at his watch  Five-thirteen 
My respects to the captain and ask him to join me for breakfast at say eight-thirty  In my cabin here 
Captain Montgomery whether by luck or design design Talbot was certain brought the Kilcharran alongside the Ariadne with faultless precision  Talbot stepped across the two gunwales they were almost exactly of a height and made his way up to the bridge 
Captain Montgomery was a tall burly character with a jutting black beard white teeth a slightly hooked nose and humorous eyes and in spite of the immaculately cut uniform and four golden rings on either cuff could easily have passed for a well-to-do and genial eighteenth-century Caribbean pirate  He extended a hand 
You 'll be Commander Talbot of course  The voice was deep the Irish brogue unmistakable 
You are welcome aboard  Has there been any further deterioration in the situation 
No  The only deterioration possible Captain is one I do n't care to imagine 
Indeed  I shall be sadly missed in the Mountains of Mourne 
We 're great ones for the lamentations the weepings and the wailings in the Mountains of Mourne  Is this atom bomb or whatever still ticking away 
It is  I suppose you might call it a deterioration when the ticking stops 
You should n't have come here Captain  You should have nipped into the Gulf of Corinth you might have stood a chance there 
Not to be thought of for a moment  Nothing to do with heroics heroics are for those epics they make in Hollywood or the fact that I could n't live with myself 
I just could n't stand the thought of what that man would say  You 'll be referring to Vice-Admiral Hawkins 
The very same  Maligning and blackening my character as usual I dare say 
Hardly  Talbot smiled 
He did mind you make some casual remark about you being allergic to certain naval regulations  He also said you 're the best in the business 
Aye  A fair man and a bloody good admiral but do n't tell him I said so 
I suggest coffee in my cabin Commander and perhaps you 'll be kind enough to tell me all you know  That should n't take long 
Eleven p.m. the President said  What 's the time over there 
Six a.m  There 's a seven-hour time difference 
A very forthright character this Admiral Hawkins  The President gazed thoughtfully at the two dispatches lying on his desk 
You know him of course  Pretty well sir 
An able man General  Exceptionally so 
He also appears to be an exceptionally tough s.o.b  That 's undoubtedly true sir 
But then you have to be to command the NATO Mediterranean sea forces  Do you know him John 
This was to John Heiman the Defence Secretary the only other person present  Yes 
Not as well as the General but well enough to agree with the General 's assessment  Pity I never met him 
Who selected him for the job General  Usual NATO committee 
You were on it of course  Yes 
I was the chairman  Ah 
The man with the casting vote  No casting vote 
The decision was unanimous  I see 
He well he seems to have rather a low opinion of the Pentagon  He does n't exactly say that 
But he does appear to have a low opinion deep suspicions if you like of a person or persons in the Pentagon  Puts you in a rather unhappy position 
I mean there must be some stirrings in the Pentagon dovecote  As you say Mr President a few ruffled feathers 
Some are hopping mad  Others are giving the matter serious consideration 
Generally you could speak of an air of quiet consternation  Are you personally prepared to lend any credence to this outrageous suggestion 
Or what appears to be outrageous  Think the unthinkable 
I do n't have any option do I  Every instinct says no this can not be those are all my friends and colleagues of many years standing all honourable men 
But instinct is a fallible guide Mr President  Common sense and what little knowledge of history I have tells me that every man has his price 
I have to investigate  The enquiry is already under way 
I thought it prudent not to involve the intelligence arms of the four services  So the FBI 
The Pentagon does not care to be investigated by the FBI  It 's an extremely difficult and delicate situation sir 
Yes  One can hardly go up to an admiral of the fleet and ask him what he was doing on the night of Friday the thirteenth 
I wish you luck  The President looked at one of the papers before him 
Your message re the krytron that provoked Hawkins 's ire must have been badly handled  It was 
Very badly  The matter has been attended to 
This krytron device  Is it operational 'Yes 
Been sent  The General shook his head the President pressed a button and a young man entered 
Take this message for the General here  Krytron device en route 
Would greatly appreciate up-to-date assessment of existing problems and measures being taken  Fully appreciate extreme gravity dangers and complexities of the situation 
I personally guarantee total and immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate support and cooperation in all measures undertaken  That should do it 
Sign my name  I hope he appreciates the three immediates the General said 
Eight-forty sir McKenzie said  Admiral 's apologies but he 'd like to see you 
He 's in his cabin with Captain Montgomery  Talbot thanked him rose washed the sleep from his face and eyes and made his way to the admiral 's quarters 
A shirtsleeved Hawkins beckoned him to join himself and Montgomery at the breakfast table  Coffee 
Sorry to disturb you but these are times that are sent to try men 's souls  For a troubled soul Hawkins looked remarkably fresh rested and relaxed and was attacking his breakfast with some gusto 
Captain Montgomery has been reporting the state of progress and I thought you might like to hear it  Incidentally our friend the timing device is still ticking merrily away 
We are making progress Montgomery said  Slow but steady slow because the presence of what the Admiral calls your friend the timing device does have a rather inhibitory effect and we 're probably taking some quite needless precautions as far as acoustic levels are concerned 
But we 're dealing with a devil we do n't know and we 're paying the devil more than his due  Our own sonar is now locked on to this device and the sonar room has suddenly become the focal centre of interest in the Kilcharran 
We have achieved two things  First by coupling up the battery resources of our two vessels we have ample electric power to lift this wreck 
Your young Lieutenant Denholm looks and talks like a character out of P. G. Wodehouse but he unquestionably knows his stuff  Your engineer officer McCafferty is no slouch either and neither is mine 
Anyway no problem  Secondly we 've cut away the port wing of the bomber 
You 've what  Talbot said 
Well you know how it is  Montgomery sounded almost apologetic 
It was three parts torn away in any case and I figured that neither you nor the US Air Force would have any further use for it  So I had it burnt off 
Despite his faint air of apology it was quite clear that Montgomery had no regrets about what had been a wholly unilateral decision as the only expert on the spot he had no intention of consulting anybody  A difficult decision and a tricky operation 
No one as far as I know has ever before cut away the wing of a submerged big jet  That 's where the fuel tanks are located and though it seemed likely that the partial tearing away of the wing had also ruptured the fuel lines and spilled the fuel there was no way of being sure and no one again as far as I know has ever come up against the problem of what happens when an oxyacetylene jet meets a fuel tank under water 
But my men were very careful there was no fuel and so no trouble  And now at the present moment my men are securing flotation bags and lifting slings to the plane 
Removing this wing gives us two advantages one minor one major  The minor one is that with the wing and two very heavy jet engines gone we have all that less to lift although I 'm certain we could have lifted the whole lot without trouble 
The major one is that the wing had it been left there would have snagged on the underside of the Kilcharran as it surfaced and tilted the fuselage maybe to so acute an angle as to make access to this damned bomb difficult or impossible  Very well done Captain Hawkins said 
But surely there 's still one problem  When the bomber surfaces is n't the weight of the remaining wing and its two engines going to tilt it just as far in the other direction 
Montgomery smiled in a kindly and tolerant fashion which any average person would have found more than wildly infuriating  Hawkins fortunately was not an average person 
No problem Montgomery said  We 're also securing flotation bags under that wing 
When the fuselage surfaces the wings will still be under water you know how low wings are set on a modern jet  In the first stage of surfacing only the top of the fuselage will be above water-level when we cut away a rectangular section over where the bomb is located I want as much water as possible below that section to dissipate the heat of the oxyacetylene torches 
After we 've made that hole in the top we 'll lift the fuselage high enough to drain most of the water from it  How long will it take to inflate the bags and haul the plane to the surface 
An hour or two  I do n't know 
An hour or two  Hawkins made no attempt to conceal his surprise 
I should have thought a few minutes  You do n't know you say 
I would have thought those things could have been pretty closely calculated  Normally yes 
Montgomery 's air of massive restraint was on a par for provocation with his kindly tolerance  But normally we 'd use powerful diesel compressors 
Out of deference to the little lady lying on the sea floor no diesel  Electricity again but using only a fraction of the power 
So an indeterminate period  Do you think I could have some more coffee 
Montgomery clearly regarded the conversation as over  Van Gelder knocked on the opened door and entered a message slip in his hand 
He handed it to Hawkins  For you Admiral 
Came in a couple of hours or so ago  Not urgent so I did n't think it worth waking you for it 
A wise decision my boy  Hawkins read it smiled broadly and handed it to Talbot who glanced at it smiled in turn and read it out aloud 
Well well Talbot said  Hobnobbing with presidents 
Perhaps after all sir you could walk down Pennsylvania Avenue without being clapped in irons or whatever they do to you over in those parts  More importantly you have the krytron and this splendid pledge of cooperation 
Your indignation the less charitable would call it calculated gamble has paid off  I like the repeat immediate bit 
The President would appear to have a sense of humour  He would indeed 
One has to be grateful to him for intervening personally  Very very satisfactory 
I note that he requires information  Would you please 
Naturally  Emphasis of course on the gravity and the dangers 
Of course  Another item of news sir Van Gelder said to Talbot 
I 've just had a rather intriguing chat with Irene Charial  I can well imagine that 
Andropulos and company of course are now at liberty  How are they this fine morning 
Glowering a bit sir  At least Andropulos and Alexander were 
But the cook was in fine form and they seemed to be thawing a bit when I left them chattering away in Greek with Denholm sitting among them and not understanding a word they were saying  Irene was n't there 
Oh  So naturally overcome by concern you hurried up to my cabin to enquire after her health 
Naturally  I knew that was what you would want me to do sir 
She did n't look as if she had slept too well and admitted as much  Seemed worried apprehensive even 
At first she was rather reluctant to talk about what was bothering her  Misplaced loyalty I should say 
I would say so too Talbot said  If that is I knew what you were talking about 
Sorry  Turned out she wanted to know if Uncle Adam had been sending any radio messages 
It seems  Uncle Adam 
Adamantios Andropulos  His parents have a lot to answer for 
Seems that she and her pal Eugenia both sets of parents live in Piraeus the two girls are at the University in Athens were in the habit of phoning home every night  She wanted their parents to know that they had had an accident were safely aboard a Royal Navy ship and would be home soon 
I hope she 's right Hawkins said  Me too sir 
I told her no messages had been sent and suggested that if Uncle was a businessman I thought it better not to mention that we already knew he was a multi-millionaire businessman he might naturally tend to be secretive and that he might also be reluctant to broadcast the fact that he had lost his yacht through what might have been his own fault  She said that was no excuse for not informing the next of kin of the three crew members of the Delos who had died 
I asked her if she had raised the question with him and she said no  She was a bit evasive on this point 
I gather she either does n't know very much about Uncle Adam or does n't care very much about what she does know  Van Gelder produced a paper from his pocket 
I told her to write a message and I would see it was sent  Talbot looked at the paper 
It 's in Greek  Perhaps this Uncle Adam 
We share the same nasty suspicious mind sir  I called Jimmy from the breakfast table 
Quite innocent he says  I have a better idea 
Take the two young ladies to the radio-room  It 's a simple matter to lock into the telephone land lines through the Piraeus radio station 
They can talk direct to their folks  With Jimmy just happening to be there 
We share as you say the same nasty suspicious minds  Before you do that however I think we 'll go and see how our latest recruit is getting on 
Ah  Our resident cryptologist 
Theodore  Theodore 
After we 've seen him and the young ladies have finished their calls I want you to take Irene Charial aside  And engage her in casual conversation 
What else  It would seem that she and her uncle are less than soul-mates and of course she will be feeling suitably grateful to you for having permitted her to speak to her folks 
Find out what you can about Andropulos  Find out what she thinks of him 
See what you can discover about his business or businesses  Find out who his business contacts and friends are and what she thinks of them assuming of course that she 's ever met any of them 
And it would be very interesting to know where his travels take him I 'm not talking about his yacht cruises when she is with him and why they take him there  You are asking me sir in effect to ply Irene with cunning and devious questions to entrap her if you will to engage in duplicity and extract unwitting information from a sweet and innocent girl 
Yes  A pleasure sir 
Theodore was a cheerful plump man in his late forties with a pale face and thick pebble glasses those last a very probable consequence of having spent a lifetime poring over abstruse codes  You have come to check on progress gentlemen 
I am making some I 'm happy to report  Took me quite some time to find the key the connection between the code and the Odyssey 
Since then it 's straightforward  These sheets are in three sections and I 'm now about two-thirds of the way through the first one 
Found anything of interest  Talbot said 
Interesting  Fascinating Captain fascinating 
Statements of his accounts bank holdings if you like  He has his money stashed away stashed is the word all over the world it seems 
As a matter of interest I 'm totting up the sum of his holdings as I go along  He 's made it very easy for me everything is in US dollars 
So far let me see it 's two-eighty  Yes two-eighty 
Dollars  A man could retire on that Van Gelder said 
Indeed  Two-eighty 
Followed by six zeros  Talbot and Van Gelder looked at each other in silence then bent forward over Theodore 's shoulders to look at the figures he had added up 
After some seconds they straightened looked at each other again then bent forward once more  Two hundred and eighty million dollars Talbot said 
On that you could retire Vincent  If I scraped and pinched a bit I might manage 
Do you know where those bank accounts are kept Theodore  Cities countries I mean 
Some I do because he 's given names and addresses some I do n't  For the second lot he may have another code which I do n't have or he just knows them by heart 
By heart I would guess  I have no means of knowing where at least half the accounts are 
Just the amounts that 's all  Could you show us some of those 
Talbot said  Of course 
Theodore pointed to some entries flipped over several pages and indicated several more  Just amounts as I said 
As you see there 's a differing capital letter after each entry  They mean nothing to me 
Maybe they do to Andropulos  Talbot leafed through the pages again 
Five letters just five recur regularly Z W V B and G. Well now  If you were a thrifty citizen and wanted a safe piggy-bank secure from the prying eyes of nasty parties such 
as police and income tax authorities which country would you choose  Switzerland 
I think the same far from original thought had occurred to Andropulos for at least half his assets  Z for Zurich 
W  Winterthur perhaps 
V  Off-hand I do n't know about that one 
Vevey  Van Gelder said 
On Lake Geneva  I do n't think so 
Hardly what you might call an international banking centre  Ah 
I have it  Not in Switzerland but it might as well be 
Vaduz  Liechtenstein 
I do n't know much about those things but I understand that once cash disappears into the vaults of Vaduz it never surfaces again  B could be Berne or Basle Andropulos would know of course 
G has to be Geneva  How am I doing Number One 
Splendidly  I 'm sure you 're right 
I hardly like to point out sir that we still do n't have the names and addresses of those banks  True 
Crest-fallen but only slightly  We still have names and addresses of other banks 
You have a list of those cities where those banks are located  I do n't have to Theodore said 
I have it in my head  They 're all over the place west east and in between 
Places as different as Miami Tijuana Mexico City BogotÃ¡ in Colombia Bangkok Islamabad in Pakistan Kabul in Afghanistan  Why anyone should want to hide away money in Kabul is quite beyond me 
Country is torn by war and the Russians occupy and control the capital  Andropulos would appear to have friends everywhere Talbot said 
Why should the poor Russians be left out in the cold  That about the lot 
Quite a few other places Theodore said  Mostly smaller accounts 
One exception though  The biggest deposit of the lot 
Where  Washington DC 
Well now  Talbot was silent for a few minutes 
What do you make of that Number One  I think I 've just about stopped making anything out of anything 
My mind has kind of taken a leave of absence  But my eyes are still working in a fashion you might say 
I think I see a faint light at the end of the tunnel  I think if we think a bit more it might turn into a search-light 
How much money  Eighteen million dollars 
Eighteen million dollars Van Gelder said  My my 
Even in Washington DC a man could buy a lot with eighteen million dollars  The Angelina to put it at its most kindly was a rather striking-looking craft 
An eighty-tonner built of pinewood from the forests of the island of Samos she had a dazzling white hull which contrasted strongly some would have said violently with her vermilion gunwale  Wide of beam and low in the water amidships she had a pronounced flare aft and for'ard a curved stem that projected high above the gunwale 
As a sailing boat she was well equipped with a standing-lug main and balance-lug foresail together with two jibs  Had it been left at that as she had originally been built the Angelina a typical example of the Tehandiri class would not only have been striking but downright handsome 
Unfortunately it had not been left at that  The owner Professor Wotherspoon although a self-avowed traditionalist was also strongly attached to his creature comforts 
Not content with converting the craft 's very considerable hold it was after all originally constructed as a cargo vessel into cabins and bathrooms he had constructed on the deck a bridge saloon and galley which while admittedly functional detracted notably from the overall aesthetic effect  Shortly before ten o'clock in the morning the Angelina almost slack-sailed and ghosting along under a Meltemi that hardly rated as a zephyr tied up along the starboard side of the Ariadne 
Talbot accompanied by Denholm climbed down a rope ladder to greet the owner  The first impression that Talbot had of Wotherspoon was that he did n't look a bit like a professor or an archaeologist but then he had to admit he had no idea what a professor or archaeologist was supposed to look like 
He was tall lean shock-haired and deeply tanned humorous of mien and colloquial of speech he was the last person one would expect to find wandering through the groves of Academe  He was certainly not more than forty years old 
His wife with auburn hair and laughing hazel eyes was at least ten years younger and was also it seemed an archaeologist  Introductions effected by Denholm Talbot said I appreciate this very much Professor 
Very kind of you to come  Not to say very gallant 
You appreciate that there is a fair chance that you might find yourself prematurely in another world  Lieutenant Denholm did explain the dangers to you 
In a cautious and roundabout fashion  He 's become very tight-lipped since he joined the Senior Service 
I did n't join  I was dragooned 
He did mention something about vaporization  Well one gets a bit tired of studying ancient history 
Much more interesting to be a part of the making of it  It might be a very short-lived interest indeed 
Does Mrs Wotherspoon share your short-lived interests  'Angelina please 
We had to entertain a very prim and proper Swiss lady the other day and she insisted on addressing me as Madame Professor Wotherspoon  Ghastly 
No I ca n't say I share all of my husband 's more extravagant enthusiasms  But alas he does have one professorial failing 
He 's horribly absent-minded  Someone has to look after him 
Talbot smiled  A fearful thing for so young and attractive a lady to be trapped for life 
Again thank you both very very much  I should like it if you would join us for lunch 
Meantime I 'll leave Lieutenant Denholm to explain the full horrors of the situation to you especially the ones you 'll encounter across the lunch table  Gloom and despondency Van Gelder said 
It ill becomes one so young and beautiful to be gloomy and despondent  What is the matter Irene 
In so far as one so young and beautiful could look morose Irene Charial gazed out morosely over the taffrail of the Ariadne  I am not Lieutenant-Commander Van Gelder in the mood for flattery 
Vincent  Flattery is an insincere compliment 
How can the truth be flattery  But you 're right about the word mood 
You are in a mood  You 're worried upset 
What 's troubling you  Nothing 
Being beautiful does n't mean you 're above telling fibs  You could hardly call that flattery could you 
No  A fleeting smile touched the green eyes 
Not really  I know this is a very unpleasant situation you find yourself in 
But we 're all trying to make the best of it  Or did something your parents say upset you 
You know perfectly well that that 's not true  Van Gelder also knew it Denholm had reassured him on that point 
Yes that 's so  You were hardly in a cheerful frame of mind when I first met you this morning 
Something worries you  Is it so dreadful a secret that you ca n't tell me 
You 've come here to pry have n't you  Yes 
To pry and probe  Crafty cunning devious questions to extra information from you that you do n't know you 're giving away 
It was Van Gelder 's turn to look morose  I do n't think I 'm very good at it 
I do n't think you are either  That man sent you did n't he 
What man  Now you 're being dishonest 
Commander Talbot  Your captain 
A cold man  Distant 
Humourless  He 's neither cold nor distant 
And he 's got a very considerable sense of humour  Humour 
I do n't see any signs of it  I 'm beginning not to be surprised 
Van Gelder had stopped smiling  Maybe he thought it would be wasted on you 
Maybe he 's right  She appeared not to have taken offence 
Or maybe I just do n't see too much to laugh about at the moment  But I 'm right about the other thing 
He 's remote distant  I 've met people like him before 
I doubt it very much  In the same way that I doubt your power of judgement 
You do n't seem to be very well equipped in that line  Oh 
She made a moue  Flattery and charm have flown out the window is that it 
I do n't flatter  I 've never claimed to have charm 
I meant no harm  Please 
I see nothing wrong with being a career officer  But he lives for only two things the Royal Navy and the Ariadne 
You poor deluded creature  Van Gelder spoke without heat 
But how were you to know  John Talbot lives for only two things his daughter and his son 
Fiona aged six and Jimmy aged three  He dotes on them 
So do 1  I 'm their Uncle Vincent 
Oh  She was silent for some moments 
And his wife  Dead 
I am sorry  She caught his arm 
To say I did n't know is no excuse  Go ahead 
Call me a clown  I do n't flatter I do n't charm and I do n't tell lies 
But you do turn a pretty compliment  She took her hand away leaned on the rail and looked out over the sea 
After some time she said without looking around It 's my Uncle Adam is n't it  Yes 
We do n't know him we do n't trust him and we think he 's a highly suspicious character  You will forgive me talking about your nearest and dearest in this fashion 
He is not my nearest and dearest  She had turned to face him 
There was neither vehemence in her voice nor marked expression in her face at most a slight degree of bewilderment in both  I do n't know him I do n't trust him and I think he 's a highly suspicious character 
If you do n't know him what on earth are were you doing aboard his yacht  I suppose that too seems suspicious 
Not really  Three reasons I would think 
He 's a very persuasive man  He seems to be genuinely fond of our family my younger brother and sister and myself for he is forever giving us presents very expensive presents too and it seemed churlish to refuse his invitation 
Then there was the element of fascination I know practically nothing about him nor what his business activities are or why he spends so much time in foreign countries  And of course perhaps both Eugenia and I are snobs at heart and were flattered by the invitation to go cruising on a very expensive yacht 
Well good enough reasons  But still not good enough to explain why you went with him if you dislike him 
I did n't say I disliked him  I said I distrusted him 
Not the same thing  And I did n't begin distrusting him until this trip 
Why start now  Alexander is why 
She gave a mock shudder  Would you trust Alexander 
Candidly no  And Aristotle is almost as bad 
The three of them spent hours talking together usually in the radio-room  Whenever Eugenia or I went near them they stopped talking 
Why  Obvious is n't it 
They did n't want you to hear what they were talking about  Ever been with him abroad on his business 
Good heavens no  She was genuinely startled at the idea 
Not even on the Delos  I 've only been on the Delos once before 
With my brother and sister  A short trip to Istanbul 
He was going to have less than a sensational report to make to his captain Van Gelder reflected  She did n't know her uncle 
She did n't know what his businesses were  She never travelled with him 
And her only reason for distrusting him was that she distrusted Alexander a feeling almost certainly shared by the majority of people who had ever met him  Van Gelder made one last try 
Your mother 's brother of course  She nodded 
What does she think of him  She never speaks ill of him 
But she never speaks ill of anyone  She 's a wonderful lady a wonderful mother not simple or anything like that just a very trusting person who could never bring herself to speak ill of anyone 
She 's obviously never met Alexander  Your father 'He never speaks of Uncle Adam either but he does n't speak in a very different way if you follow me 
My father is a very straight very honest man very clever head of a big construction company highly respected by everyone  But he does n't speak of my uncle 
I 'm not as trusting as my mother  I believe my father strongly disapproves of Uncle Adam or whatever businesses he runs 
Or both  I do n't believe they 've talked in years 
She shrugged and gave a faint smile  Sorry I ca n't be of more help 
You have n't learnt anything have you  Yes I have 
I 've learnt I can trust you  This time the smile was warm and genuine and friendly 
You do n't flatter you do n't charm and you do n't tell lies  But you are gallant 
Yes Van Gelder said  I believe I am 
Sir John the President said you have put me in a most damnably awkward position  I speak you understand more in sorrow than in anger 
Yes Mr President  I am aware of that and I 'm sorry for it 
It is of course no consolation for you to know that I am in an equally awkward situation  If Sir John Travers the British Ambassador to the United States did indeed find himself in such a situation he showed no signs of it 
But then Sir John was renowned throughout the diplomatic world for his savoir-faire his monolithic calm and his ability to remain wholly unruffled in the most trying and difficult situations  I 'm only the messenger boy 
Grade one of course  Who the hell is this fellow Hawkins anyway 
Richard Hollison deputy head of the FBI could n't quite match Sir John 's tranquil serenity but he had his obvious anger under tight control  I do n't think I care very much for having a foreigner telling the White House the Pentagon and the FBI how to run their business 
Hawkins is a Vice-Admiral in the British Navy  The General was the fourth and only other person in the office 
An exceptionally able man  I can not think of any United States naval officer whom I would sooner have in his place in those near-impossible circumstances 
And I do n't think I need point out that I am in the most awkward situation of all  I do n't want to sound overly possessive but bloody hell the Pentagon is my concern 
Richard Hollison Sir John said  I 've known you for some years now 
I know your reputation for toughness is matched only by your reputation for fairness  Be fair in this case 
Admiral Hawkins as the General has just said is in a position of having to cope with almost impossible circumstances which as you are in a position to know better than most involves making almost impossible decisions  He 's not telling anyone how to run their business 
In order to get a message to the President without anyone in the Government or the Pentagon seeing the message before the President he elected to bypass the Pentagon and all the standard avenues of communication  Certainly the Pentagon knows it 's already under investigation but Hawkins did n't want anyone to know that he was pointing fingers in certain directions 
If it is your intention to set a cat among the pigeons or let loose an eagle in the dovecote you do n't send a postcard in advance announcing your intentions  Yes I accept that Hollison said 
With weary resignation I accept it  But do n't ask me to like it 
Like it or lump it the President said I accept it too  He looked unenthusiastically at the paper before him on his desk 
It would appear that this Adamantios Andropulos who is Hawkins 's temporary guest-I could well imagine that Admiral Hawkins would use the term guest even if this unfortunate were clapped in irons in some shipboard dungeon has an account with a Washington bank name and address supplied of some eighteen million dollars and would we kindly make enquiries to see if he has been disbursing any of this of late and if so in what direction  I know this lies well within your capabilities Richard 
Point is how long will it take  All depends upon how many false names how many dud companies how much of the usual laundering paraphernalia is involved 
The villain if there is a villain might well have a numbered account in outer Mongolia  Unlikely I admit but you take my point 
One hour maybe three  We will not stand upon the order of our going 
Excuse me Mr President  Excuse me gentlemen 
Hollison left  The Army and the Marines will be pleased to learn when they do learn of it that Admiral Hawkins does not consider them worthy of his regard the President went on 
Only the Air Force and the Navy  The Air Force I can in the circumstances understand 
But it would be interesting to know why he has deemed the Navy to be deserving of his interests  He gives no indications on that score 
The President sighed  Maybe he does n't even trust me 
Or maybe he knows something that we do n't know  Sir John said placidly If that is the case that he knows something we do n't I have little doubt that he 'll tell us in the fullness of time 
The man under discussion in the White House was at that moment dwelling on precisely the same subject  Time 's winged chariot John 
I forget the rest of the quotation but it 's definitely on the wing  Leaning back in a comfortable armchair a glass of frosted lime juice in his hand Hawkins succeeded only in giving the impression of a man with all the time in the world 
So much to do so little time to do it in  How stands the Ariadne in respect of the rest of this uncaring world 
I think you might say sir that the patient is coming along as well as could be expected  Our carpenter is aboard the Angelina building a cradle for the bomb according to the specifications the Pentagon gave us 
There will be two hinged clamps to secure it in even the worst weather which as you can see for yourself is the last thing we expect today  Indeed 
The Admiral looked through the window of his cabin  The weather is all wrong John 
Considering the possibly apocalyptic and doom-laden task we have on hand the least we could reasonably expect is high winds torrential rain thunder lightning tempests tornadoes and all those other adverse weather conditions that King Lear encountered on his walkabout around the blasted heath  But what do we have 
A blistering July sun a cloudless blue sky and the wine-dark seas without even a ripple to show for themselves  Downright disappointing 
Also disappointing not to say extremely disturbing is the likelihood that if those zero-wind conditions persist it 'll take the Angelina a week to get even half way towards the horizon  I do n't think we have to worry about that sir 
Weather conditions in the Cyclades between early July and mid-September are remarkably predictable  It 's already eleven forty-five 
Any minute now the Meltemi the Etesian wind will start up from the north-west  During the afternoon it reaches Forces 5 or 6 sometimes even seven 
Usually dies away in the evening but it has been known to last all night  The Meltemi will be ideally suited for the Angelina 
Those luggers as Denholm said are hopeless windward sailors but in this case it will be directly astern of them and carry them down towards the KÃ¡sos Strait to the east of the easternmost tip of Crete  Sounds fine but well even if Montgomery manages to raise this bomber if he manages to cut a hole in the fuselage without blowing us all to kingdom come if he manages to extract the atom bomb and if he manages to secure it to the Angelina 's cradle what happens if the thing detonates before he reaches the KÃ¡sos Strait 
Then that 's it for Wotherspoon and his crew  For us the risk is low 
I 've been talking to Dr Wickram about this  He seems convinced of the inherent stability of the hydrogen bomb after all he does build the damn things 
While he says it would be a hundred per cent certain to go up if an atom bomb exploded alongside it we must n't over-estimate the effects of a more remote explosive shock even at a distance of a few miles  After all those bombs did survive the effect of the explosion in the nose of the bomber and the impact of the plane hitting the water at high speed 
Besides the intervening miles of water we hope there will be those intervening miles should have a powerfully dampening effect  There 'll be no such effect for those aboard the Angelina 
Curtains  What motivates a man like that John 
Obviously he 's incredibly brave but well is he all right  If you mean is he off his rocker then we 're all off our rockers 
He 's as sane as you or I. He 's a romantic at heart a born adventurer a couple of hundred years ago and he 'd have been somewhere on the other side of the world building up the odd empire  That 's as may be 
But it 's still a terrible thought that a man like that should die for us  He wo n't be dying for all of us 
I 'm going on the Angelina  So is Vincent Van Gelder 
Hawkins put down his glass and stared at him  Do you know what you 're saying 
I know what you 're saying and I think you 've taken leave of your senses  Are you mad 
You and Van Gelder  Quite mad 
Van Gelder insists on coming along  I insist on going 
That 's all there is to it  I absolutely forbid it 
With the deepest respect Admiral you 'll forbid me nothing  Did you honestly expect me to leave a job half done 
Did you honestly expect me to let him go out there and die alone  I would remind you that I am the captain of this ship and that at sea not even an admiral can take over from me or give orders which I consider to be to the detriment of this vessel 
Mutiny  Hawkins waved a dismissive hand at his lime juice 
Have we nothing stronger than this  Naturally 
Talbot went to the Admiral 's wine cupboard and prepared a drink while Hawkins gazed at a spot on the deck which was about a thousand miles away  A large scotch and water 
No ice  Thank you 
Hawkins drained almost half the contents  Mutiny forsooth 
Yes sir  Ca n't hang me from the yard-arm though 
It 's my yard-arm  You have n't yet met Angelina Professor Wotherspoon 's wife I mean not the lugger 
But you will  I 've invited them aboard for lunch 
Young rather lovely nice sense of humour and dotty about her husband  She has to be dotty I mean to do something she dearly does n't want to do that is to go along from here with her husband and the bomb on the lugger 
I 'm sure I shall be delighted to make her acquaintance  Hawkins took another sip of his drink 
What 's she got to do with the matter in hand  She 's not going with the bomb and the lugger 
Neither is Wotherspoon for that matter or his two crew members  They remain aboard the Ariadne 
Wotherspoon of course will have to be forcibly restrained but that 's no problem at all  Van Gelder and I will take the Angelina down through the KÃ¡sos Strait 
Two small medals will suffice  Hawkins was silent for quite some time then said How are you going to pin on a couple of posthumous VCs or whatever when you 're circling the earth in a vaporized orbit 
One problem at a time  We ca n't let the girl go 
Good God no  I 'll never forgive myself 
I never even started to think  I wonder 
Wonder me no wonders sir  We do n't have room for three heroes aboard the Angelina 
Someone has to take the Ariadne home again remember  Well that 's the Angelina 
Now the Kilcharran  I 've just been talking to Captain Montgomery 
He 's just given a couple of experimental tugs on the lifting slings and he reckons the bomber with the help of the flotation bags of course is nearing a state of neutral buoyancy  Twenty minutes half an hour at the most and he 's going to start to haul away 
You wo n't want to miss that sir  No indeed 
What did Walter de la Mare say look your last on all things lovely every hour  This may be the last thing I 'll ever see 
I rather hope it does n't come to that sir  Apart from the lugger and the recovery of the bomber we have to wait for three other things 
The reaction to the message we sent to the President via our embassy in Washington which might take quite some time for even the most cooperative of banks and banks almost by definition are secretive and detest the very thought of cooperation are going to be very reluctant to disclose any information about their important clients because important clients do n't like that sort of thing  Admittedly Air Force Generals and Admirals are unlikely to be very important financially but they are from the point of view of prestige and power and would I should think carry a disproportionate amount of clout 
I do hope we have n't upset too many people over there  Then and this I should expect very soon there should be a reply from Greek Intelligence to our query asking for the complete list of places where Andropulos has conducted business any kind of business over the past few years 
Then of course we await the arrival of this krytron device from America  Which may arrive any old time 
I mean we have no idea have we  Do the Americans have supersonic planes 
Sure they have  But fighters only 
And their nearest refuelling point would be the Azores and I 'm quite certain no fighter could fly the close on two thousand miles they 'd have to travel to get there  Question of fuel capacity 
Besides it 's not absolutely essential that we get this device before leaving with the bomb always assuming of course that we do leave  We could always dump the bomb drop a marker warn all shipping to keep clear wait for the krytron to arrive return there and detonate the bomb 
Much more satisfactory if it could all be done in one fell swoop  Hawkins thought for a moment then smiled 
What 's the time in Washington  Four a.m. I think 
Excellent excellent  A short message 
Ask them how it 's being transported and what 's the expected time of arrival  Give 'em something to do 
Talbot lifted a phone and dictated the message  Have n't seen your second-in-command lately Hawkins said 
I understood he was prising secrets loose from Andropulos 's niece  Vincent normally carries out his duties with efficiency and dispatch 
When the duties involve Irene Charial it seems to take a little longer  Not so many years ago it would have taken me a little longer myself 
Ah  Van Gelder had appeared in the doorway 
Just discussing you young man  A difficult and protracted interview I take it 
One treads delicately sir  But she told me everything she knew 
He looked reproachfully at Talbot  I detect a trace of scepticism in your expression sir 
Unwarranted I assure you  I believe her I trust her and I was not bewitched by her green eyes owing to the fact that I was on duty at the time 
Less than admirable though they may be Vincent deviousness and low cunning have their place in the scheme of things  It was n't like that at all 
I told her that you had sent me to try to trap her into making unwary and unguarded statements and unwittingly to betray herself  After that we got along famously 
Talbot smiled  Just another way of being devious 
What does she know  Nothing 
I guarantee you 'd come to the same conclusion sir  She does n't know her uncle except superficially 
She does n't trust him  She thinks he 's a highly suspicious character 
She thinks Alexander is a highly suspicious character although that would n't require any great acumen on anyone 's part  She knows nothing about his businesses 
She 's never travelled with him  Her father whom she obviously dotes on and has the highest respect for thinks he 's a highly suspicious character he and Andropulos have n't spoken for years 
She 's convinced that her father knows a great deal about her uncle and his businesses but Dad refuses to discuss any aspect of the matter  Sounds as if we could do with Dad aboard right now Hawkins said 
I have the feeling we could learn some very interesting things from him  I 'm sure we could sir 
One odd thing she 's convinced that her uncle is genuinely fond of her  Hawkins smiled 
I think it would be rather difficult not to be fond of the young lady  However I would point out in the passing and apropos of nothing that mass murderers have been known to dote on tiny tots 
I hardly think he 's a mass murderer sir  And she 's certainly not a tiny tot 
He looked speculatively at Talbot  A passing thought John 
Yes  Talbot looked out through the window for an unseeing moment then back at Hawkins 
How do we know he 's not a mass murderer  The speculation was still in Hawkins 's eyes 
You do n't normally make remarks like that  Not without good reason 
You have something in mind  I think I have 
But it 's so far back in my mind that I ca n't reach it  It 'll come 
He turned as Denholm entered the cabin  I seem to recall having asked you this question before 
What drags you away from the fleshpots  Duty sir 
You will have noticed Admiral Talbot said how devoted the Ariadne 's officers are to their duty  I thought Jimmy that you were supposed to be lurking and eavesdropping 
I have lurked sir  And eavesdropped 
I have also been plying Mr Andropulos and his friends with strong drink  At this time of the morning 
Hawkins said  Captain 's orders sir 
I hope Captain that the Admiralty are going to take care of my bar bill  Prodigious 
Not as prodigious as their thirsts  They have relaxed a bit 
They have apparently agreed that I 'm simple-minded  They are quite certain I do n't know a word of Greek but even so they 're still very cautious 
Much given to allusions and cryptic references all made for good measure in a Macedonian dialect  Which you learnt at your mother 's knee 
A bit later than that  But I 'm at home in it 
I do n't know whether you will consider this good news or bad sir but Andropulos knows there are hydrogen bombs aboard that bomber  He even knows there are fifteen of them 
There was a fairly lengthy silence while the other three men in the cabin considered the implications of Denholm 's words then Hawkins said Good news and bad news  Good news for us bad news for Andropulos 
Well done my boy  Very well done 
I echo that sir Talbot said  Lieutenant Denholm is miscast as either a classicist or electronics officer 
MI5 should have him  There is no way that Andropulos could have learnt aboard the Ariadne of the existence of those bombs 
So he knew before  Proof if that were needed of our near-certain conviction that Andropulos has penetrated the Pentagon 
I would point out sir Denholm said that the words hydrogen bombs were n't actually used  Also it 's only my word against theirs 
That 's irrelevant and this is no court of law  There will be no confrontation 
All that matters is that we know and they do n't know that we do  My usefulness is over 
Or do I continue to lurk  Lurk of course 
The three A's must be making some contingency plans  We know now why they wanted aboard the Ariadne 
What we do n't know is what they intend to do now that they are here  Resume your wassailing 
Wassailing  Denholm sounded bitter 
I have an arrangement with Jenkins whereby I consume copious quantities of tonic water lemon and ice  Ghastly 
He turned to go but Talbot stopped him as a seaman entered and handed over a sheet of paper  You might as well hear what 's in this 
He studied the paper briefly  This is in reply to a request we made of Greek Intelligence for as exhaustive a list as they could supply of all places where Andropulos is known either to do business or have contacts 
No names no addresses just towns  Forty or fifty of them 
My my  This list was n't compiled on the spur of the moment 
Greek Intelligence must have been taking a more than passing interest in the activities of our friend Andropulos over a long period years I would think  I wonder why 
About half of those places are marked by asterisks  Again I wonder why 
Was that for their own information or is it intended to suggest something to us  He handed the paper to Hawkins who studied it for a moment then said I know those places marked with an asterisk 
I do n't see their relevance in our circumstances  I ca n't even remotely associate them with our problem 
I 'd swear that none of those places had any connection with hydrogen bombs  So would I Talbot said 
Maybe they handle something else  In spite of the situation we find ourselves in maybe hydrogen bombs are n't the biggest cause for concern 
If you can imagine anything worse than our present situation that is  Could I have that back sir 
He sat at the desk made some marks on the paper before him then looked up  Bangkok Islamabad Kabul BogotÃ¡ Miami Mexico City Tijuana San Diego Bahamas Ocho Rios Ankara Sofia Andropulos playing both sides of the fence with those last two the ethnic Turks are having a very bad time in Bulgaria just now but Andropulos would n't let that interfere with his business interests and Amsterdam 
What does that list suggest  Drugs Van Gelder said 
Drugs  Heroin cocaine marijuana you name 
it  Now some more towns 
Tehran Baghdad Andropulos again playing both sides of the fence Iran and Iraq had been at war for six years now Tripoli Damascus Beirut Athens Rome East Berlin New York and London  That suggest something 
Yes  It was Van Gelder again 
Terrorism  I 'm not quite sure why New York and London qualify 
I seem to remember there have been two attempts one at John F. Kennedy the other at Heathrow to smuggle bombs aboard planes  Both bungled both failed 
I think it 's fairly safe to assume in fact it would be criminally negligent not to assume that the terrorists who planned those crimes are still in residence in London and New York waiting  Jimmy would you please go to your cabin and bring Theodore here with whatever further results his cryptology has turned up 
Hawkins said I most sincerely hope that you are not thinking what I think you are if you follow me  It may be sir that I am thinking what you are if you follow me 
What you are suggesting is that this Andropulos is some kind of mastermind possible world co-ordinator of drug-smuggling  Is that what you meant by your remark that we did n't know he was n't a mass murderer 
Yes sir  What else can that list of contacts he has in drug areas mean 
Where else has he accumulated his vast wealth and we have n't added it all up yet not by any means  There 's no actual proof 
All depends on what you call proof  It 's very powerful suggestive evidence 
How far are you prepared to stretch the long arm of coincidence  To infinity 
And you 're further suggesting he 's engaged in terrorism  That he 's using his vast profits from drug-smuggling to finance his terrorist activities 
It 's possible but I do n't think so.l think the two activities are being run in tandem  A drug-peddler is one thing 
A terrorist quite another  Incompatibles 
Poles apart  Never the twain shall meet 
One hesitates to contradict a senior officer  But I 'm afraid you 're wrong sir 
Vincent would you enlighten the Admiral  You know what I 'm talking about 
All too well sir  October 1984 Admiral our last submarine patrol 
North Atlantic about two hundred miles west of the Irish coast  I can remember it as if it were yesterday 
We were asked to move into position to observe but not to intercept a small American ship en route from the States to Ireland and given its course and estimated time when it would pass a certain point  Neither the crew of this vessel nor its captain a certain Captain Robert Anderson who I believe is still at large knew that they had been monitored from the moment they had left port by an American spy-in-the sky satellite 
We upped periscope identified it then downed periscope  They never saw us 
It was a New England trawler the Valhalla based on Gloucester Massachusetts from which it had sailed a few days earlier  It transferred its cargo to an Irish tug the Marita Ann which was duly seized by the Irish Navy 
The cargo consisted entirely of military hardware rifles machine-guns shotguns pistols hand grenades rockets and as I recall about 70,000 rounds of ammunition all destined for the IRA  It was to have been the IRA 's biggest gun-running plot ever but it was foiled because of what was called Operation Leprechaun where the CIA our MI5 and Irish Intelligence took a healthy or unhealthy it all depends on your point of view interest in the activities of Noraid an Irish-American group that specialized for all I know it may still be specializing in buying American arms and shipping them to the IRA in Ireland 
Round about the same time a Panamanian registered cargo ship by the name of the Ramsland chartered by the same gang who had organized the Valhalla put into Boston harbour and was promptly seized by the United States Coast Guard  The Ramsland had secret compartments below decks but the Coast Guard knew all about those secret compartments 
They held no less than thirty tons of marijuana another smuggling record  The proceeds from the sale of those drugs were of course intended to fund IRA terrorist activities 
We became quite interested in the drugs-terrorist connection Talbot said and made some discreet enquiries  At least five other drug-terrorist connections had been discovered and broken up 
It is believed that considerably more connections have not been discovered and so not broken up  Why should Andropulos be an exception to what appears to be a fairly well established rule 
A suitably chastened admiral sits before you Hawkins said  We live we learn 
You two should join Denholm and offer your services to MI5  Ah the man himself 
Denholm entered the cabin with Theodore who handed over to Talbot some papers he had with him  Talbot looked at them and handed them over to Hawkins 
Well well well Hawkins said  What an interesting coincidence or in view of what I 've just been learning perhaps not all that much of a coincidence 
Fifteen of the towns that Greek Intelligence asterisked if that 's the word on their list  Only in this case my my my they give names and addresses 
Is n't that splendid  Captain a thought has occurred to me 
There 's one of those towns marked with an asterisk that you omitted to mention  Washington DC 
Does that come under D for drugs or T for terrorism  Neither 
B for bribery  Are you about through this list Theodore 
Two-thirds I would say  And that will be the end of it 
No Captain  There 's still a last list 
It would be gratifying if it held some more revelations but perhaps that would be too much to hope for  How long have you been up and around Theodore 
Three o'clock this morning  Three-thirty 
I 'm not sure I was a bit fuzzy  If I had known what would be required of me this morning I would n't have gone to that birthday celebration last night 
And it 's now noon or thereabouts  Seven hours of beating your brains out when you were n't feeling all that hot to begin with 
You must be exhausted  But I would appreciate it if you could at least finish this present list off 
After that Jimmy I suggest that Theodore has a drink snack and snooze in that order  The two men left 
If you agree Admiral I suggest that Vincent contacts Greek Intelligence after Theodore has finished that list and furnishes them with a list of the towns together with the appropriate names and addresses  Could help 
And what do you imagine Greek Intelligence can do  Very little I imagine 
But they can forward the list with utmost urgency to Interpol  Admittedly Interpol 's writ does n't run worldwide they would have zero clout in places say like Tripoli Tehran or Beirut and they are an information gathering and dispensing agency not an executive unit and they know more about bad people than any other group in the world 
And ask them if they suspect suspect not have proof that Andropulos is engaged in drug-running  Shall be done sir 
Sign it Admiral Hawkins  Naturally 
Hawkins shook his head  Admiral Hawkins here Admiral Hawkins there it seems he 's signing his name everywhere 
Or rather somebody 's signing it for him  I shall have to look to my cheque-books 
Barack Hussein Obama II ( (listen) bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Obama was the first African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.  Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, a year after beginning his campaign, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the general election and was inaugurated alongside his running mate Joe Biden, on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. 
Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms include: the Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare"), although without a public health insurance option; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen and suspected al-Qaeda operative, leading to controversy. He ordered military involvement in Libya for the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.  After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military interventions in Iraq and Syria in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, oversaw and ultimately apologized for the deadly Kunduz hospital airstrike, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland was denied hearings or a vote from the Republican-majority Senate. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C.During Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, appearing at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and campaigning for Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020). 
Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states. He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent. In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind." He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965. After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.  At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him "a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works."In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname "Barry". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear." Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind." Obama was also a member of the "choom gang", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985. 
In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: "It's like a little mini-United Nations," he said. "I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher." Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living. Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011. In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down. The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin. Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001. The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy. In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female. Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021. 
Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed.In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2020) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2020). Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books. On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for secular humanism." He described his father as a "confirmed atheist" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change." 
In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life." On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.  Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992. During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized. Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him "of all the different people I've met along the way", adding: "I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times." The items, "a whole bowl full", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa. 
Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens. Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute. In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.  Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father. 
In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book. He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The case was settled out of court. Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation. He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. Obama's law license became inactive in 2007.  Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn. Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. 
In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq. On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally, and spoke out against the war. He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd "it's not too late" to stop the war.Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004. Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history. He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not do well.  Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005, becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons; and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. He also cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007. 
Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006. In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.Obama resigned his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois. The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic "House Divided" speech in 1858. Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system, in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support. Obama delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide.During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008. On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain. Obama won 52.9 percent of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7 percent. He became the first African-American to be elected president. Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park. He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others are Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy. 
On April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled "It Begins with Us" that he posted on his website. As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries, and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. With 51.1 percent of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: "Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties."  The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion. 
The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits. Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children. In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop "strict guidelines" on the research.  Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009, becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent. Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station. 
On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed "common-sense gun reform" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality. On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military. 
As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word "gay" in an inaugural address. In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).  On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets. 
Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company. In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", which temporarily boosted the economy.The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013. During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter. GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain". Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million, while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package." Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics. Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. 
On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government. Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions." On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans. 
On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads. 
In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a "new era" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms "break" and "reset" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya. On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran. On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for "A New Beginning" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace. On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election.In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki. Awlaki was an American imam suspected of being an Al-Qaeda organizer and supporter. Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike without the rights of due process being afforded. The killing lead to significant controversy and may have increased Awlaki's influence. His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate US military actions, although they were not targeted specifically.  In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a "Joint Planning Cell" with Saudi Arabia. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion. Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people. 
On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces. On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over. On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be "home for the holidays."  In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing. In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. In early 2015, with the addition of the "Panther Brigade" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400, and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield. 
Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to "stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan", an area he said had not received the "strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires". He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so. Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, "with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation." In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: "To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics." Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was "dangerous" and "bad".On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution. 
In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to "show no mercy" to the rebels of Benghazi—announced an immediate cessation of military activities.The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector. Some Representatives questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath. Obama later expressed regret for playing a leading role in the destabilization of Libya, calling the certain situation there "a mess." He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the "worst mistake" of his presidency.  On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: "The time has come for President Assad to step aside." This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the "red line" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL. 
Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The "Complex Modernization" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the "effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions." In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency. 
On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.  Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City. The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente. Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be "Obama's finest foreign policy achievement." On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana. The countries' respective "interests sections" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively. Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. 
Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima towards the end of World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Although he was pressured to by atomic bomb survivor groups, he did not apologize for the decision to drop the bomb. 
In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010. In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.After Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure. George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had "allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong." Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era. 
According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39 percent in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50 percent in January 2015 according to Gallup.Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  Obama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008. His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video "Yes We Can", which was viewed ten million times on YouTube in its first month and received a Daytime Emmy Award. In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year. The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as "the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments." On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first president of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples." Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with "deep gratitude and great humility." The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. Obama's peace prize was called a "stunning surprise" by The New York Times. Some neoconservatives praised his speech for what they viewed as pro-American content. He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. Obama's Nobel Prize was viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said that Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect of encouraging the President. 
Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump. The family currently rents a house in Kalorama, Washington, D.C. On March 2, 2017, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama "for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage." His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.  When Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice. After Senate Republicans revealed the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, Obama released a Facebook post on June 22 calling the bill "a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America." On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing "a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions." After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision. Two days later, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation in Chicago from October 31 to November 1, 2017. He intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.In May 2018, Obama criticized President Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action saying "the deal was working and it was in U.S. interests." Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020. 
In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck. On October 29, 2019, Obama criticized "wokeness" and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation's annual summit.On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for president in the 2020 election, stating that he has "all the qualities we need in a president right now." In May 2020, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis "an absolute chaotic disaster", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been "our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before." Trump retaliated by accusing Obama of having committed "the biggest political crime in American history", although he refused to say what he was talking about, telling reporters: "You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody."  Obama wrote a presidential memoir, in a $65 million deal with Penguin Random House. The book, A Promised Land, was released on November 17, 2020. In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about "their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'" More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects. 
Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed, however in 2017 the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term. In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaged in a federally protected activity.As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights. In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year. In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.According to Julian Zelizer's The Presidency of Barack Obama, under Obama's presidency, the "Democrats lost more than one thousand seats in state legislatures, governors' mansions, and Congress during his time in office." adding that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder."During Obama's presidency, a record 3.2 million people were deported from the United States. His record deportations earned Obama the nickname "Deporter in Chief". In February 2020, Biden called the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people without criminal records under the Obama administration a "big mistake".Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating. A 2018 survey of historians by the American Political Science Association ranked Obama the 8th-greatest American president. Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.  The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library. It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.

Barack Obama at Politifact  Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of cuisines, sweet and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snackfoods, tea and traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon derive from its essential oil and principal component, cinnamaldehyde, as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol. 
Cinnamon is the name for several species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few Cinnamomum species are grown commercially for spice. Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", but most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from the related species Cinnamomum cassia, also referred to as "cassia". In 2018, Indonesia and China produced 70% of the world's supply of cinnamon, Indonesia producing nearly 40% and China 30%.  The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, deriving from the Ancient Greek κιννάμωμον (kinnámōmon, later κίνναμον : kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was similar to the related Hebrew word קינמון (qinnāmōn).The name "cassia", first recorded in late Old English from Latin, ultimately derives from the Hebrew word q'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, similar to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries. 
Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who reported that it had come from China had confused it with Cinnamomum cassia, a related species. Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a deity; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus. Its source was kept a trade secret in the Mediterranean world for centuries by those in the spice trade, in order to protect their monopoly as suppliers.Cinnamomum verum, which translates from Latin as "true cinnamon", is native to India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Cinnamomum cassia (cassia) is native to China. Related species, all harvested and sold in the modern era as cinnamon, are native to Vietnam ("Saigon cinnamon"), Indonesia and other southeast Asian countries with warm climates.  In Ancient Egypt, cinnamon was used to embalm mummies. From the Ptolemaic Kingdom onward, Ancient Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon. 
The first Greek reference to κασία : kasía is found in a poem by Sappho in the 7th century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh and labdanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. Herodotus, Aristotle and other authors named Arabia as the source of cinnamon; they recounted that giant "cinnamon birds" collected the cinnamon sticks from an unknown land where the cinnamon trees grew and used them to construct their nests.: 111 Pliny the Elder wrote that cinnamon was brought around the Arabian peninsula on "rafts without rudders or sails or oars", taking advantage of the winter trade winds. He also mentioned cassia as a flavouring agent for wine, and that the tales of cinnamon being collected from the nests of cinnamon birds was a traders' fiction made up to charge more. However, the story remained current in Byzantium as late as 1310.According to Pliny the Elder, a Roman pound (327 grams [11.5 oz]) of cassia, cinnamon (serichatum), cost up to 1,500 denarii, the wage of fifty months' labour. Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices from 301 AD gives a price of 125 denarii for a pound of cassia, while an agricultural labourer earned 25 denarii per day. Cinnamon was too expensive to be commonly used on funeral pyres in Rome, but the Emperor Nero is said to have burned a year's worth of the city's supply at the funeral for his wife Poppaea Sabina in AD 65.  Through the Middle Ages, the source of cinnamon remained a mystery to the Western world. From reading Latin writers who quoted Herodotus, Europeans had learned that cinnamon came up the Red Sea to the trading ports of Egypt, but where it came from was less than clear. When the Sieur de Joinville accompanied his king, Louis IX of France to Egypt on the Seventh Crusade in 1248, he reported—and believed—what he had been told: that cinnamon was fished up in nets at the source of the Nile out at the edge of the world (i.e., Ethiopia). Marco Polo avoided precision on the topic.The first mention that the spice grew in Sri Lanka was in Zakariya al-Qazwini's Athar al-bilad wa-akhbar al-'ibad ("Monument of Places and History of God's Bondsmen") about 1270. This was followed shortly thereafter by John of Montecorvino in a letter of about 1292.Indonesian rafts transported cinnamon directly from the Moluccas to East Africa (see also Rhapta), where local traders then carried it north to Alexandria in Egypt. Venetian traders from Italy held a monopoly on the spice trade in Europe, distributing cinnamon from Alexandria. The disruption of this trade by the rise of other Mediterranean powers, such as the Mamluk sultans and the Ottoman Empire, was one of many factors that led Europeans to search more widely for other routes to Asia. 
During the 1500s, Ferdinand Magellan was searching for spices on behalf of Spain, and in the Philippines found Cinnamomum mindanaense, which was closely related to C. zeylanicum, the cinnamon found in Sri Lanka. This cinnamon eventually competed with Sri Lankan cinnamon, which was controlled by the Portuguese.In 1638, Dutch traders established a trading post in Sri Lanka, took control of the manufactories by 1640, and expelled the remaining Portuguese by 1658. "The shores of the island are full of it," a Dutch captain reported, "and it is the best in all the Orient. When one is downwind of the island, one can still smell cinnamon eight leagues out to sea." The Dutch East India Company continued to overhaul the methods of harvesting in the wild and eventually began to cultivate its own trees.  In 1767, Lord Brown of the British East India Company established Anjarakkandy Cinnamon Estate near Anjarakkandy in the Kannur district of Kerala, India. It later became Asia's largest cinnamon estate. The British took control of Ceylon from the Dutch in 1796. 
Cinnamon is an evergreen tree characterized by oval-shaped leaves, thick bark and a berry fruit. When harvesting the spice, the bark and leaves are the primary parts of the plant used. Cinnamon is cultivated by growing the tree for two years, then coppicing it, i.e., cutting the stems at ground level. The following year, about a dozen new shoots form from the roots, replacing those that were cut. A number of pests such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diplodia species and Phytophthora cinnamomi (stripe canker) can affect the growing plants.The stems must be processed immediately after harvesting while the inner bark is still wet. The cut stems are processed by scraping off the outer bark, then beating the branch evenly with a hammer to loosen the inner bark, which is then pried off in long rolls. Only 0.5 mm (0.02 in) of the inner bark is used; the outer, woody portion is discarded, leaving metre-long cinnamon strips that curl into rolls ("quills") on drying. The processed bark dries completely in four to six hours, provided it is in a well-ventilated and relatively warm environment. Once dry, the bark is cut into 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) lengths for sale.  A less than ideal drying environment encourages the proliferation of pests in the bark, which may then require treatment by fumigation with sulphur dioxide. In 2011, the European Union approved the use of sulphur dioxide at a concentration of up to 150 mg/kg (0.0024 oz/lb) for the treatment of C. verum bark harvested in Sri Lanka. 
A number of species are often sold as cinnamon:  Cinnamomum cassia (cassia or Chinese cinnamon, the most common commercial type in the USA) 
C. burmannii (Korintje, Padang cassia, or Indonesian cinnamon)  C. loureiroi (Saigon cinnamon, Vietnamese cassia, or Vietnamese cinnamon) 
C. verum (Sri Lanka cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon or Cinnamomum zeylanicum)  C. citriodorum (Malabar cinnamon)Cassia induces a strong, spicy flavour and is often used in baking, especially associated with cinnamon rolls, as it handles baking conditions well. Among cassia, Chinese cinnamon is generally medium to light reddish-brown in colour, hard and woody in texture, and thicker (2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) thick), as all of the layers of bark are used. Ceylon cinnamon, using only the thin inner bark, has a lighter brown colour and a finer, less dense, and more crumbly texture. It is subtle and more aromatic in flavour than cassia and it loses much of its flavour during cooking. 
The barks of the species are easily distinguished when whole, both in macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. Saigon cinnamon (C. loureiroi) and Chinese cinnamon (C. cassia) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills.  The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, but if it is treated with tincture of iodine (a test for starch), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon, but when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced. 
The Sri Lankan grading system divides the cinnamon quills into four groups:  Alba, less than 6 mm (0.24 in) in diameter 
Continental, less than 16 mm (0.63 in) in diameter  Mexican, less than 19 mm (0.75 in) in diameter 
Hamburg, less than 32 mm (1.3 in) in diameterThese groups are further divided into specific grades. For example, Mexican is divided into M00000 special, M000000 and M0000, depending on quill diameter and number of quills per kilogram. Any pieces of bark less than 106 mm (4.2 in) long are categorized as quillings. Featherings are the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots. Chips are trimmings of quills, outer and inner bark that cannot be separated, or the bark of small twigs.  In 2020, four countries accounted for 98% of the world production of cinnamon, a total of 222,122 tonnes: Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. 
Cinnamon sticks are harder to counterfeit than cinnamon powder, that without reliable certification can be mixed with cassia and falsely marketed as authentic. For example, in one analysis authentic Ceylon cinnamon bark contained 143 mg/kg but marked samples contained 3462 mg/kg which the author suggested was diluted with cassia.ConsumerLab.com found the same problem in a 2020 analysis; "a supplement that contained the highest amount of coumarin was labeled as Ceylon cinnamon".  Cinnamon bark is used as a spice. It is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material. It is used in the preparation of chocolate, especially in Mexico. Cinnamon is often used in savoury dishes of chicken and lamb. In the United States and Europe, cinnamon and sugar are often used to flavour cereals, bread-based dishes, such as toast, and fruits, especially apples; a cinnamon and sugar mixture (cinnamon sugar) is sold separately for such purposes. It is also used in Portuguese and Turkish cuisine for both sweet and savoury dishes. Cinnamon can also be used in pickling and Christmas drinks such as eggnog. Cinnamon powder has long been an important spice in enhancing the flavour of Persian cuisine, used in a variety of thick soups, drinks and sweets. 
Ground cinnamon is composed of around 11% water, 81% carbohydrates (including 53% dietary fiber), 4% protein and 1% fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, ground cinnamon is a rich source of calcium (100% of the Daily Value (DV)), iron (64% DV) and vitamin K (30% DV).  The flavour of cinnamon is due to an aromatic essential oil that makes up 0.5 to 1% of its composition. This essential oil can be prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in sea water, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the characteristic odour of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste. The pungent taste and scent come from cinnamaldehyde (about 90% of the essential oil from the bark) and, by reaction with oxygen as it ages, it darkens in colour and forms resinous compounds.Cinnamon constituents include some 80 aromatic compounds, including eugenol found in the oil from leaves or bark of cinnamon trees. 
Cinnamon is used as a flavouring in cinnamon liqueur, such as cinnamon-flavoured whiskey in the United States, and rakomelo, a cinnamon brandy popular in parts of Greece.  Cinnamon has a long history of use in traditional medicine as a digestive aid, however, contemporary studies are unable to find evidence of any significant medicinal or therapeutic effect.Reviews of clinical trials reported lowering of fasting plasma glucose and inconsistent effects on hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c, an indicator of chronically elevated plasma glucose). Four of the reviews reported a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, only two reported lower HbA1c, and one reported no change to either measure. The Cochrane review noted that trial durations were limited to 4 to 16 weeks, and that no trials reported on changes to quality of life, morbidity or mortality rate. The Cochrane authors' conclusion was: "There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus." Citing the Cochrane review, the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health stated: "Studies done in people don't support using cinnamon for any health condition." However, the results of the studies are difficult to interpret because it is often unclear what type of cinnamon and what part of the plant were used.A meta-analysis of cinnamon supplementation trials with lipid measurements reported lower total cholesterol and triglycerides, but no significant changes in LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol. Another reported no change to body weight or insulin resistance. 
A systematic review of adverse events as a result of cinnamon use reported gastrointestinal disorders and allergic reactions as the most frequently reported side effects.In 2008, the European Food Safety Authority considered the toxicity of coumarin, a component of cinnamon, and confirmed a maximum recommended tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight. Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations and metabolic effect in humans with CYP2A6 polymorphism. Based on this assessment, the European Union set a guideline for maximum coumarin content in foodstuffs of 50 mg per kg of dough in seasonal foods, and 15 mg per kg in everyday baked foods. The maximum recommended TDI of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight equates to 5 mg of coumarin (or 5.6 g C. verum with 0.9 mg coumarin per gram) for a body weight of 50 kg. C as shown in the table below:  Freshly ground cinnamon sticks contain higher amount of desired (like cinnamaldehyde) and undesired phytochemicals (like coumarin) than cinnamon powder. 
Due to the variable amount of coumarin in C. cassia, usually well over 1.0 mg of coumarin per g of cinnamon and sometimes up to 12 times that, C. cassia has a low safe-intake-level upper limit to adhere to the above TDI. In contrast, C. verum has only trace amounts of coumarin.  Canella, a plant known as "wild cinnamon" or "white cinnamon"

"In pictures: Sri Lanka's spice of life". BBC News.  Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). 
The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.  The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling. 
The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.  The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. 
Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets and enter it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact. Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk and destroys the diary. 
In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents' murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter's best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff.  In Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), he is unwillingly entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a contest between schools of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry is Hogwarts' second participant after Cedric Diggory, an unusual occurrence that causes his friends to distance themselves from him. He competes against schools Beauxbaton and Durmstrang with the help of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. Harry claims the Triwizard Cup with Cedric, but in doing so is teleported to a graveyard where Voldemort's supporters convene. Moody reveals himself be to Barty Crouch, Jr, a Death Eater. Harry manages to escape, but Cedric is killed and Voldemort is resurrected using Harry's blood. 
In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society to counter Voldemort; meanwhile, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. Umbridge bans the Defense Against the Dark Arts; in response, Hermione and Ron form "Dumbledore's Army", a secret group where Harry teaches what Umbridge forbids. Harry is punished for disobeying Umbridge, and dreams of a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic. Near the end of the book, Harry falsely dreams of Sirius being tortured; he races to the Ministry where he faces Death Eaters. The Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers' lives, but Sirius is killed. A prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is then revealed: one must die at the hands of the other.  In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Snape teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts while Horace Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook with annotations by the Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves success in Potions class. Harry also takes lessons with Dumbledore, viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve. Harry learns from a drunken Slughorn that he used to teach Tom Riddle, and that Voldemort divided his soul into pieces, creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and Dumbledore travel to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they succeed, but Dumbledore weakens. On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters attacking the school. The book ends with the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince. 
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh novel in the series, Lord Voldemort gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione learn about the Deathly Hallows, legendary items that lead to mastery over death. The group infiltrate the ministry, where they steal a locket Horcrux, and visit Godric's Hollow, where they are attacked by Nagini. A silver doe Patronus leads them to the Sword of Gryffindor, with which they destroy the locket. They steal a Horcrux from Gringotts and travel to Hogwarts, culminating in a battle with Death Eaters. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia, but lends Harry his memories before he dies. Harry learns that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that he himself is a Horcrux. Harry surrenders to Voldemort and dies. The defenders of Hogwarts continue to fight on; Harry is resurrected, faces Voldemort and kills him.  An epilogue titled "Nineteen Years Later" describes the lives of the surviving characters and the impact of Voldemort's death. Harry and Ginny are married with three children, and Ron and Hermione are married with two children. 
The novels fall into the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify as a type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the bildungsroman, or coming of age novel, and contain elements of mystery, adventure, horror, thriller, and romance. The books are also, in the words of Stephen King, "shrewd mystery tales", and each book is constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery adventure. The stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half-Blood Prince).  The series can be considered part of the British children's boarding school genre, which includes Rudyard Kipling's Stalky & Co., Enid Blyton's Malory Towers, St. Clare's and the Naughtiest Girl series, and Frank Richards's Billy Bunter novels: the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in Hogwarts, a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of magic. In this sense they are "in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life", though they are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British setting.In Harry Potter, Rowling juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary. Her narrative features two worlds: a contemporary world inhabited by non-magical people called Muggles, and another featuring wizards. It differs from typical portal fantasy in that its magical elements stay grounded in the mundane. Paintings move and talk; books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world both exotic and familiar. This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling's characters. Their names are often onomatopoeic: Malfoy is difficult, Filch unpleasant and Lupin a werewolf. Harry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses; the scholar Roni Natov terms him an "everychild". These elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic, making him both an everyman and a fairytale hero.Each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes a matter of life and death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement. 
The Harry Potter stories feature imagery and motifs drawn from Arthurian myth and fairytales. Harry's ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend. His life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella. Hogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle with several professors who belong to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a real historical person, a 14th-century scribe, Sir Nicolas Flamel, is described as a holder of the Philosopher's Stone. Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment and sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments are similar to the "marvellous tents" put up for knightly tournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around Hogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts.Many of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances. Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as characters, and white deer. The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th-century French Arthurian romance, Claris et Laris, writing of the "startling" similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris. Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards.Like C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter also contains Christian symbolism and allegory. The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul. Children's literature critic Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ. Comparing Rowling with Lewis, she argues that "magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality". According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an "ecce homo" speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy.Rowling stated that she did not reveal Harry Potter's religious parallels in the beginning because doing so would have "give[n] too much away to fans who might then see the parallels". In the final book of the series Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Rowling makes the book's Christian imagery more explicit, quoting both Matthew 6:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:26 (King James Version) when Harry visits his parents' graves. Hermione Granger teaches Harry Potter that the meaning of these verses from the Christian Bible are "living beyond death. Living after death", which Rowling states "epitomize the whole series". Rowling also exhibits Christian values in developing Albus Dumbledore as a God-like character, the divine, trusted leader of the series, guiding the long-suffering hero along his quest. In the seventh novel, Harry speaks with and questions the deceased Dumbledore much like a person of faith would talk to and question God.  Harry Potter's overarching theme is death. In the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and "a terrible sadness" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him. Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The series has an existential perspective – Harry must grow mature enough to accept death. In Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees. Unlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.Love distinguishes Harry and Voldemort. Harry is a hero because he loves others, even willing to accept death to save them; Voldemort is a villain because he does not. Harry carries the protection of his mother's sacrifice in his blood; Voldemort, who wants Harry's blood and the protection it carries, does not understand that love vanquishes death.Rowling has spoken about thematising death and loss in the series. Soon after she started writing Philosopher's Stone, her mother died; she said that "I really think from that moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the seven books". Rowling has described Harry as "the prism through which I view death", and further stated that "all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death".While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good vs. evil, its moral divisions are not absolute. First impressions of characters are often misleading. Harry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is on the side of good because he opposes Snape, who appears to be malicious; in reality, Quirrell is an agent of Voldemort, while Snape is loyal to Dumbledore. This pattern later recurs with Moody and Snape. In Rowling's world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and the possibility of redemption are key themes of the series. This is reflected in Harry's self-doubts after learning his connections to Voldemort, such as Parseltongue; and prominently in Snape's characterisation, which has been described as complex and multifaceted. In some scholars' view, while Rowling's narrative appears on the surface to be about Harry, her focus may actually be on Snape's morality and character arc.Rowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious". The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, "because that ... is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble". 
Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series. Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over one's most harrowing ordeals – and thus coming to terms with them" has also been considered. Rowling has stated that the books comprise "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry" and that they also pass on a message to "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".  In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly "fell into her head". Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying: 
"I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me."  Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents. The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to several publishers. 
After twelve other publishers had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book. Despite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 26 June 1997. It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholastic – the American publisher of the books – as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, after the American rights sold for US$105,000 – a record amount for a children's book by an unknown author. Scholastic feared that American readers would not associate the word "philosopher" with magic, and Rowling suggested the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the American market. Rowling has later said that she regrets the change.The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series, at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version. It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005. The seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published on 21 July 2007. Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact, the epilogue) was completed "in something like 1990".Rowling retained rights to digital editions and released them on the Pottermore website in 2012. Vendors such as Amazon displayed the ebooks in the form of links to Pottermore, which controlled pricing. All seven Harry Potter books have been released in unabridged audiobook versions, with Stephen Fry reading the UK editions and Jim Dale voicing the series for the American editions.  The series has been translated into 80 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history. The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean, Armenian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Bulgarian, Welsh, Afrikaans, Albanian, Latvian, Vietnamese and Hawaiian. The first volume has been translated into Latin and even Ancient Greek, making it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD. The second volume has also been translated into Latin.Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well-known authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.The United States editions were adapted into American English to make them more understandable to a young American audience. 
For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket on the cover of the final book.International and later editions have been created by a range of designers, including Mary GrandPré for U.S. audiences and Mika Launis in Finland. For a later American release, Kazu Kibuishi created covers in a somewhat anime-influenced style.  The popularity of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other Harry Potter related license holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author. The books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular film adaptations produced by Warner Bros., all of which have been highly successful in their own right. The total revenue from the book sales is estimated to be around $7.7 billion. The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the bestselling books in history. The films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products. The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25 billion.The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated The New York Times to create a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list. On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. For the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book. Together, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book. In the United States, the book's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies. This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5 million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8 million copies. Within the first 24 hours of its release, 6.9 million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S.; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day. The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours. 
The final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first twenty-four hours of release. The book sold 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US. The series has also gathered adult fans, leading to the release of two editions of each Harry Potter book, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults.  Early in its history, Harry Potter received positive reviews. On publication, the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as The Scotsman, which said it had "all the makings of a classic", and The Glasgow Herald, which called it "Magic stuff". Soon the English newspapers joined in, with The Sunday Times comparing it to Roald Dahl's work ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit".By the time of the release of the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar, and critic Harold Bloom raised criticisms of the books' literary merits, saying, "Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing." A. S. Byatt authored an op-ed article in The New York Times calling Rowling's universe a "secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip."Michael Rosen, a novelist and poet, advocated the books were not suited for children, as they would be unable to grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer." The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative – "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain," and he speaks of "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, "I have no great opinion of it [...] it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a 'school novel,' good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." By contrast, author Fay Weldon, while admitting that the series is "not what the poets hoped for", nevertheless goes on to say, "but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose."The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times, stating, "There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep – openly, with tears splashing – and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written." Charles Taylor of Salon.com, who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have "a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art", he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Stephen King called the series "a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable", and declared "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" to be "remarkable". However, he wrote that he is "a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books.Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying "It depresses me to see 16- and 17-year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas." The Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that "through no fault of Rowling's", the cultural and marketing "hysteria" marked by the publication of the later books "trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide". Jenny Sawyer wrote in The Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that Harry Potter neither faces a "moral struggle" nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus "no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white". In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to Platform 9+3⁄4 as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.In an 8 November 2002 Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a "trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him". In a 12 August 2007, review of Deathly Hallows in The New York Times, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for "unmooring" her "English school story" from literary precedents "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created "a world of youthful democracy and diversity". 
In 2016, an article written by Diana C. Mutz compares the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign.There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.  The portrayal of women in Harry Potter has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender. Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles. According to scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series. The final three books "showcase richer roles and more powerful females": for instance, the series' "most matriarchal character", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione's status as a feminist model is debated. Girls and women are more frequently shown as emotional, more often defined by their appearance, and less often given agency in family settings.The social hierarchy of wizards in Rowling's world has drawn debate among critics. "Purebloods" have two wizard parents; "half-bloods" have one; and "Muggle-born" wizards have magical abilities although neither of their parents is a wizard. Lord Voldemort and his followers believe that blood purity is paramount and that Muggles are subhuman. According to the literary scholar Andrew Blake, Harry Potter rejects blood purity as a basis for social division; Suman Gupta agrees that Voldemort's philosophy represents "absolute evil"; and Nel and Eccleshare agree that advocates of racial or blood-based hierarchies are antagonists. Gupta, following Blake, suggests that the essential superiority of wizards over Muggles – wizards can use magic and Muggles cannot – means that the books cannot coherently reject anti-Muggle prejudice by appealing to equality between wizards and Muggles. Rather, according to Gupta, Harry Potter models a form of tolerance based on the "charity and altruism of those belonging to superior races" towards lesser races.Harry Potter's depiction of race, specifically the slavery of house-elves, has received varied responses. Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement. Other critics including Farah Mendlesohn find the portrayal of house-elves "most difficult to accept": the elves are denied the right to free themselves and rely on the benevolence of others like Hermione. Pharr terms the house-elves a disharmonious element in the series, writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging; at the end of Deathly Hallows, the elves remain enslaved and cheerful. 
The books have been the subject of a number of legal proceedings, stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high market value of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor Warner Bros. to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the "Harry Potter" domain name, and suing author Nancy Stouffer to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work. Various religious fundamentalists have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as Wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children, while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas. The Harry Potter series has landed the American Library Associations' Top 10 Banned Book List in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2019 because it was anti-family, discussed magic and witchcraft, contained actual spells and curses, referenced the occult/Satanism, violence, and had characters who used "nefarious means" to attain goals, as well as conflicts with religious viewpoints.The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds. From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children, but none of the children's book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.In 2000, shortly before the publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children's books. The newspaper created a new children's section covering children's books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers. In 2004, The New York Times further split the children's list, which was still dominated by Harry Potter books, into sections for series and individual books, and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books. The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move. Time suggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a separate "mop-tops" list in 1964 when the Beatles held the top five places in its list, and Nielsen should have created a separate game-show list when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? dominated the ratings.  Harry Potter transformed children's literature. In the 1970s, children's books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic, while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of The Lord of the Rings. The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.The commercial success of Harry Potter in 1997 reversed this trend. The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue. Children's literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre. Older works in the genre, including Diana Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series and Diane Duane's Young Wizards, were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers. In the following decades, many Harry Potter imitators and subversive responses grew popular.Rowling has been compared to Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market. She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl. Some critics view Harry Potter's rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure. This is reflected in the BBC's 2003 "Big Read" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers 3 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top 10. 
Harry Potter has been described as a cultural phenomenon. The word "Muggle" has spread beyond its origins in the books, entering the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003.  A real-life version of the sport Quidditch was created in 2005 and featured as an exhibition tournament in the 2012 London Olympics. Characters and elements from the series have inspired scientific names of several organisms, including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia, the spider Eriovixia gryffindori, the wasp Ampulex dementor, and the crab Harryplax severus.Librarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books' potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would. The seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with "the qualities of highbrow literary fiction", but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches. However, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is "largely a folk legend".Research by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books. The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres. NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series, "got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading."Many fan fiction and fan art works about Harry Potter have been made. In March 2007, "Harry Potter" was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject on the internet. 
Jennifer Conn used Snape's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch's teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching, and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: "sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory".From the early 2000s onwards several news reports appeared in the UK of the Harry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners. This led J. K. Rowling to issue several statements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls. Despite the media flurry, research into the popularity of Harry Potter and sales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries.  The Harry Potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of Philosopher's Stone including a platinum award from the Whitaker Gold and Platinum Book Awards ( 2001), three Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes (1997–1999), two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards (1999 and 2001), the inaugural Whitbread children's book of the year award (1999), the WHSmith book of the year (2006), among others. In 2000, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel, and in 2001, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won said award. Honours include a commendation for the Carnegie Medal (1997), a short listing for the Guardian Children's Award (1998), and numerous listings on the notable books, editors' Choices, and best books lists of the American Library Association, The New York Times, Chicago Public Library, and Publishers Weekly.In 2002, sociologist Andrew Blake named Harry Potter a British pop culture icon along with the likes of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes. In 2003, four of the books were named in the top 24 of the BBC's The Big Read survey of the best loved novels in the UK. A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in San Diego County, California. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed the series in its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children". Time magazine named Rowling as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year award, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fandom. Three of the books placed among the "Top 100 Chapter Books" of all time, or children's novels, in a 2012 survey published by School Library Journal: Sorcerer's Stone ranked number three, Prisoner of Azkaban 12th, and Goblet of Fire 98th. In 2012, the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London featured a 100-foot tall rendition of Lord Voldemort in a segment designed to show off the UK's cultural icons. In November 2019, the BBC listed the Harry Potter series on its list of the 100 most influential novels. 
In 1998, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million ($1,982,900).  Rowling had creative control on the film series, observing the filmmaking process of Philosopher's Stone and serving as producer on the two-part Deathly Hallows, alongside David Heyman and David Barron. Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish or French and Eastern European actors where characters from the book are specified as such.Chris Columbus was selected as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States). Philosopher's Stone was released on 14 November 2001. Just three days after the film's release, production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, also directed by Columbus, began and the film was released on 15 November 2002. Columbus declined to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, only acting as producer. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón took over the job, and after shooting in 2003, the film was released on 4 June 2004. Due to the fourth film beginning its production before the third's release, Mike Newell was chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, released on 18 November 2005. Newell became the first British director of the series, with television director David Yates following suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Production began in January 2006 and the film was released the following year in July 2007. Yates was selected to direct Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which was released on 15 July 2009. The final instalment in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in two cinematic parts: Part 1 on 19 November 2010 and Part 2 on 15 July 2011. 
A new prequel series consisting of five films will take place before the main series. The first film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released in November 2016, followed by the second Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald in November 2018; the next three are due to be released in 2021, 2022 and 2024 respectively. Rowling wrote the screenplay for the first three instalments, marking her foray into screenwriting.  A number of non-interactive media games and board games have been released such as Cluedo Harry Potter Edition, Scene It? Harry Potter and Lego Harry Potter models, which are influenced by the themes of both the novels and films. 
There are thirteen Harry Potter video games, eight corresponding with the films and books and five spin-offs. The film/book-based games are produced by Electronic Arts (EA), as was Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, with the game version of the first entry in the series, Philosopher's Stone, being released in November 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone went on to become one of the best-selling PlayStation games ever. The video games were released to coincide with the films. Objectives usually occur in and around Hogwarts. The story and design of the games follow the selected film's characterisation and plot; EA worked closely with Warner Bros. to include scenes from the films. The last game in the series, Deathly Hallows, was split, with Part 1 released in November 2010 and Part 2 debuting on consoles in July 2011.The spin-off games Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4 and Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7 were developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The spin-off games Book of Spells and Book of Potions were developed by London Studio and use the Wonderbook, an augmented reality book designed to be used in conjunction with the PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye. The Harry Potter universe is also featured in Lego Dimensions, with the settings and side characters featured in the Harry Potter Adventure World, and Harry, Voldemort, and Hermione as playable characters. In 2017, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment opened its own Harry Potter-themed game design studio, by the name of Portkey Games, before releasing Hogwarts Mystery in 2018, developed by Jam City.  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts I and II is a play which serves as a sequel to the books, beginning nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was written by Jack Thorne based on an original new story by Thorne, Rowling and John Tiffany. It has run at the Palace Theatre in London's West End since previews began on 7 June 2016 with an official premiere on 30 June 2016. The first four months of tickets for the June–September performances were sold out within several hours upon release. Forthcoming productions are planned for Broadway and Melbourne.The script was released as a book at the time of the premiere, with a revised version following the next year. 
On 25 January 2021, a live action television series was reported to have been in early development at HBO Max. Though it was noted that the series has "complicated rights issues", due to a seven-year rights deal with Warner Bros. Domestic TV Distribution that included U.S. broadcast, cable and streaming rights to the franchise, which ends in April 2025.  Universal and Warner Brothers created The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a Harry Potter-themed expansion to the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida. It opened to the public on 18 June 2010. It includes a re-creation of Hogsmeade and several rides; its flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
In 2014 Universal opened a Harry Potter-themed area at the Universal Studios Florida theme park. It includes a re-creation of Diagon Alley and connecting alleys and a small section of Muggle London. The flagship attraction is the Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park near Los Angeles, California in 2016, and in Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka, Japan in 2014. The Osaka venue includes the village of Hogsmeade, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, and Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster.The Making of Harry Potter is a behind-the-scenes walking tour in London featuring authentic sets, costumes and props from the film series. The attraction is located at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, where all eight of the Harry Potter films were made. Warner Bros. constructed two new sound stages to house and showcase the sets from each of the British-made productions, following a £100 million investment. It opened to the public in March 2012.  Rowling expanded the Harry Potter universe with short books produced for charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned to raise money for the Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels. 
In 2016, she released three new e-books: Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide, Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists  and Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies. 
Rowling's website Pottermore was launched in 2012. Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be chosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey through the story with access to content not revealed by JK Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of additional content. The site was redesigned in 2015 as Wizardingworld.com and it mainly focuses on the information already available, rather than exploration.  The Worst Witch

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Orlando resort, Florida  Milk is a nutrient-rich liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many other nutrients, including protein and lactose. 
As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, but it exports few other milk products. Because there is an ever-increasing demand for dairy products within India, it could eventually become a net importer of dairy products. New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016, when both countries became able to produce enough to meet their inhabitants’ demand. This change contributed to an oversupply of milk in the global market.More than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, and between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.  The term "milk" comes from "Old English meoluc (West Saxon), milc (Anglian), from Proto-Germanic *meluks "milk" (source also of Old Norse mjolk, Old Frisian melok, Old Saxon miluk, Dutch melk, Old High German miluh, German Milch, Gothic miluks)".In food use, from 1961, the term milk has been defined under Codex Alimentarius standards as: "the normal mammary secretion of milking animals obtained from one or more milkings without either addition to it or extraction from it, intended for consumption as liquid milk or for further processing." The term dairy relates to animal milk and animal milk production. 
There are two distinct categories of milk consumption: all infant mammals drink milk directly from their mothers’ bodies, and it is their primary source of nutrition; and humans obtain milk from other mammals for consumption by humans of all ages, as one component of a varied diet.  In almost all mammals, milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding, either directly or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later. The early milk from mammals is called colostrum. Colostrum contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors. The makeup of the colostrum and the period of secretion varies from species to species.For humans, the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and breastfeeding in addition to other food for up to two years of age or more. In some cultures it is common to breastfeed children for three to five years, and the period may be longer.Fresh goats' milk is sometimes substituted for breast milk, which introduces the risk of the child developing electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, and a host of allergic reactions. 
In many cultures, especially in the West, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other mammals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a food product. Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in northwestern Europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. Milk is processed into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream, and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products.  Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat. The sugar lactose is found only in milk, and possibly in forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs. Lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, reaches its highest levels in the human small intestine immediately after birth, and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly. Those groups who continue to tolerate milk have often exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates, not only cattle, but also sheep, goats, yaks, water buffalo, horses, reindeer and camels. India is the largest producer and consumer of cattle- and buffalo milk in the world. 
Humans first learned to consume the milk of other mammals regularly following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several global locations from as early as 9000–7000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000 BC in the Americas. People first domesticated the most important dairy animals – cattle, sheep and goats – in Southwest Asia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. Initially animals were kept for meat, and archaeologist Andrew Sherratt has suggested that dairying, along with the exploitation of domestic animals for hair and labor, began much later in a separate secondary products revolution in the fourth millennium BC. Sherratt's model is not supported by recent findings, based on the analysis of lipid residue in prehistoric pottery, that shows that dairying was practiced in the early phases of agriculture in Southwest Asia, by at least the seventh millennium BC.From Southwest Asia domestic dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but did not reach Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC). The first farmers in central Europe and Britain milked their animals. Pastoral and pastoral nomadic economies, which rely predominantly or exclusively on domestic animals and their products rather than crop farming, were developed as European farmers moved into the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the fourth millennium BC, and subsequently spread across much of the Eurasian steppe. Sheep and goats were introduced to Africa from Southwest Asia, but African cattle may have been independently domesticated around 7000–6000 BC. Camels, domesticated in central Arabia in the fourth millennium BC, have also been used as dairy animals in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The earliest Egyptian records of burn treatments describe burn dressings using milk from mothers of male babies. In the rest of the world (i.e., East and Southeast Asia, the Americas and Australia) milk and dairy products were historically not a large part of the diet, either because they remained populated by hunter-gatherers who did not keep animals or the local agricultural economies did not include domesticated dairy species. Milk consumption became common in these regions comparatively recently, as a consequence of European colonialism and political domination over much of the world in the last 500 years.  In the Middle Ages, milk was called the "virtuous white liquor" because alcoholic beverages were safer to consume than water. James Rosier's record of the 1605 voyage made by George Weymouth to New England did report the Wabanaki people Weymouth captured in Maine did report milking "Rain-Deere and Fallo-Deere." But Journalist Avery Yale Kamila and food historians said Rosier "misinterpreted the evidence." Historians report the Wabanaki did not domesticate deer. The tribes of the northern woodlands have historically been making nut milk. Cows were imported to New England in 1624. 
The growth in urban population, coupled with the expansion of the railway network in the mid-19th century, brought about a revolution in milk production and supply. Individual railway firms began transporting milk from rural areas to London from the 1840s and 1850s. Possibly the first such instance was in 1846, when St Thomas's Hospital in Southwark contracted with milk suppliers outside London to ship milk by rail. The Great Western Railway was an early and enthusiastic adopter, and began to transport milk into London from Maidenhead in 1860, despite much criticism. By 1900, the company was transporting over 25 million imperial gallons (110 million litres; 30 million US gallons) annually. The milk trade grew slowly through the 1860s, but went through a period of extensive, structural change in the 1870s and 1880s.  Urban demand began to grow, as consumer purchasing power increased and milk became regarded as a required daily commodity. Over the last three decades of the 19th century, demand for milk in most parts of the country doubled or, in some cases, tripled. Legislation in 1875 made the adulteration of milk illegal – This combined with a marketing campaign to change the image of milk. The proportion of rural imports by rail as a percentage of total milk consumption in London grew from under 5% in the 1860s to over 96% by the early 20th century. By that point, the supply system for milk was the most highly organized and integrated of any food product. Milk was analyzed for infection with tuberculosis. In 1907 180 samples were tested in Birmingham and 13.3% were found to be infected. 
The first glass bottle packaging for milk was used in the 1870s. The first company to do so may have been the New York Dairy Company in 1877. The Express Dairy Company in England began glass bottle production in 1880. In 1884, Hervey Thatcher, an American inventor from New York, invented a glass milk bottle, called "Thatcher's Common Sense Milk Jar," which was sealed with a waxed paper disk. Later, in 1932, plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially.  In 1863, French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur invented pasteurization, a method of killing harmful bacteria in beverages and food products. He developed this method while on summer vacation in Arbois, to remedy the frequent acidity of the local wines. He found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about 50–60 °C (122–140 °F) for a brief time to kill the microbes, and that the wine could be nevertheless properly aged without sacrificing the final quality. In honor of Pasteur, the process became known as "pasteurization". Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring. Commercial pasteurizing equipment was produced in Germany in the 1880s, and producers adopted the process in Copenhagen and Stockholm by 1885. 
The females of all mammal species can, by definition, produce milk, but cow's milk dominates commercial production. In 2011, FAO estimates 85% of all milk worldwide was produced from cows. Human milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially; however, human milk banks collect donated human breastmilk and redistribute it to infants who may benefit from human milk for various reasons (premature neonates, babies with allergies, metabolic diseases, etc.) but who cannot breastfeed.In the Western world, cow's milk is produced on an industrial scale and is, by far, the most commonly consumed form of milk. Commercial dairy farming using automated milking equipment produces the vast majority of milk in developed countries. Dairy cattle, such as the Holstein, have been bred selectively for increased milk production. About 90% of the dairy cows in the United States and 85% in Great Britain are Holsteins. Other dairy cows in the United States include Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Jersey and Milking Shorthorn (Dairy Shorthorn).  Aside from cattle, many kinds of livestock provide milk used by humans for dairy products. These animals include water buffalo, goat, sheep, camel, donkey, horse, reindeer and yak. The first four respectively produced about 11%, 2%, 1.4% and 0.2% of all milk worldwide in 2011.In Russia and Sweden, small moose dairies also exist.According to the U.S. National Bison Association, American bison (also called American buffalo) are not milked commercially; however, various sources report cows resulting from cross-breeding bison and domestic cattle are good milk producers, and have been used both during the European settlement of North America and during the development of commercial Beefalo in the 1970s and 1980s.Swine are almost never milked, even though their milk is similar to cow's milk and perfectly suitable for human consumption. The main reasons for this are that milking a sow's numerous small teats is very cumbersome, and that sows can not store their milk as cows can. A few pig farms do sell pig cheese as a novelty item; these cheeses are exceedingly expensive. 
In 2012, the largest producer of milk and milk products was India followed by the United States of America, China, Pakistan and Brazil. All 28 European Union members together produced 153.8 million tonnes (169.5 million short tons) of milk in 2013, the largest by any politico-economic union.Increasing affluence in developing countries, as well as increased promotion of milk and milk products, has led to a rise in milk consumption in developing countries in recent years. In turn, the opportunities presented by these growing markets have attracted investments by multinational dairy firms. Nevertheless, in many countries production remains on a small scale and presents significant opportunities for diversification of income sources by small farms. Local milk collection centers, where milk is collected and chilled prior to being transferred to urban dairies, are a good example of where farmers have been able to work on a cooperative basis, particularly in countries such as India.  FAO reports Israel dairy farms are the most productive in the world, with a yield of 12,546 kilograms (27,659 lb) milk per cow per year. This survey over 2001 and 2007 was conducted by ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording) across 17 developed countries. The survey found that the average herd size in these developed countries increased from 74 to 99 cows per herd between 2001 and 2007. A dairy farm had an average of 19 cows per herd in Norway, and 337 in New Zealand. Annual milk production in the same period increased from 7,726 to 8,550 kg (17,033 to 18,850 lb) per cow in these developed countries. The lowest average production was in New Zealand at 3,974 kg (8,761 lb) per cow. The milk yield per cow depended on production systems, nutrition of the cows, and only to a minor extent different genetic potential of the animals. What the cow ate made the most impact on the production obtained. New Zealand cows with the lowest yield per year grazed all year, in contrast to Israel with the highest yield where the cows ate in barns with an energy-rich mixed diet. 
The milk yield per cow in the United States was 9,954 kg (21,945 lb) per year in 2010. In contrast, the milk yields per cow in India and China – the second and third largest producers – were respectively 1,154 kg (2,544 lb) and 2,282 kg (5,031 lb) per year.  It was reported in 2007 that with increased worldwide prosperity and the competition of bio-fuel production for feed stocks, both the demand for and the price of milk had substantially increased worldwide. Particularly notable was the rapid increase of consumption of milk in China and the rise of the price of milk in the United States above the government subsidized price. In 2010 the Department of Agriculture predicted farmers would receive an average of $1.35 per US gallon ($0.36/l; $1.62/imp gal) of cow's milk, which is down 30 cents per US gallon (7.9 ¢/l; 36 ¢/imp gal) from 2007 and below the break-even point for many cattle farmers. 
Milk is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein aggregates with minerals. Because it is produced as a food source for the young, all of its contents provide benefits for growth. The principal requirements are energy (lipids, lactose, and protein), biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids supplied by proteins (essential amino acids and amino groups), essential fatty acids, vitamins and inorganic elements, and water.  The pH of milk ranges from 6.4 to 6.8 and it changes over time. Milk from other bovines and non-bovine mammals varies in composition, but has a similar pH. 
Initially milk fat is secreted in the form of a fat globule surrounded by a membrane. Each fat globule is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids, along with proteins. These act as emulsifiers which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk. Although 97–98% of lipids are triacylglycerols, small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and phospholipids are also present. Unlike protein and carbohydrates, fat composition in milk varies widely due to genetic, lactational, and nutritional factor difference between different species.Like composition, fat globules vary in size from less than 0.2 to about 15 micrometers in diameter between different species. Diameter may also vary between animals within a species and at different times within a milking of a single animal. In unhomogenized cow's milk, the fat globules have an average diameter of two to four micrometers and with homogenization, average around 0.4 micrometers. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K along with essential fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are found within the milk fat portion of the milk.  Normal bovine milk contains 30–35 grams of protein per liter of which about 80% is arranged in casein micelles. Total proteins in milk represent 3.2% of its composition (nutrition table). 
The largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are "casein micelles": aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle, bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate. Each casein micelle is roughly spherical and about a tenth of a micrometer across. There are four different types of casein proteins: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-caseins. Most of the casein proteins are bound into the micelles. There are several competing theories regarding the precise structure of the micelles, but they share one important feature: the outermost layer consists of strands of one type of protein, k-casein, reaching out from the body of the micelle into the surrounding fluid. These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid.Milk contains dozens of other types of proteins beside caseins and including enzymes. These other proteins are more water-soluble than caseins and do not form larger structures. Because the proteins remain suspended in whey remaining when caseins coagulate into curds, they are collectively known as whey proteins. Lactoglobulin is the most common whey protein by a large margin. The ratio of caseins to whey proteins varies greatly between species; for example, it is 82:18 in cows and around 32:68 in humans.  Minerals or milk salts, are traditional names for a variety of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chloride are all included and they typically occur at concentrations of 5–40 mM. The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins. Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, biotin, riboflavin, folates, and pantothenic acid are all present in milk. 
For many years the most widely accepted theory of the structure of a micelle was that it was composed of spherical casein aggregates, called submicelles, that were held together by calcium phosphate linkages. However, there are two recent models of the casein micelle that refute the distinct micellular structures within the micelle.  The first theory, attributed to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellar structure. Specifically in this view unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate, giving rise to their structure, and thus no specific structure is formed. 
Under the second theory, proposed by Horne, the growth of calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation, but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins. Once bound, protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs, in which K-casein is used as an end cap to form micelles with trapped calcium phosphate nanoclusters.  Some sources indicate that the trapped calcium phosphate is in the form of Ca9(PO4)6; 
whereas others say it is similar to the structure of the mineral brushite, CaHPO4·2H2O.  Milk contains several different carbohydrate including lactose, glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose, which amounts to about 50% of the total solids of skimmed milk. Levels of lactose are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations than lactose in milks. 
Other components found in raw cow's milk are living white blood cells, mammary gland cells, various bacteria, and a large number of active enzymes.  Both the fat globules and the smaller casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as Guernsey and Jersey cattle) to impart a golden or "creamy" hue to a glass of milk. The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. Fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, and they tend to scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint. 
In most Western countries, centralized dairy facilities process milk and products obtained from milk, such as cream, butter, and cheese. In the U.S., these dairies usually are local companies, while in the Southern Hemisphere facilities may be run by large multi-national corporations such as Fonterra.  Pasteurization is used to kill harmful pathogenic bacteria such as M. paratuberculosis and E. coli 0157:H7 by heating the milk for a short time and then immediately cooling it. Types of pasteurized milk include full cream, reduced fat, skim milk, calcium enriched, flavored, and UHT. The standard high temperature short time (HTST) process of 72 °C (162 °F) for 15 seconds completely kills pathogenic bacteria in milk, rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated. Dairies print best before dates on each container, after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves. 
A side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost. Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, thiamin and vitamin B12 by 10%, and vitamin C by 20%. Because losses are small in comparison to the large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin and vitamin B12. The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.  Microfiltration is a process that partially replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk. In this process, cream is separated from the skimmed milk and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the skimmed milk is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST pasteurization). The skimmed milk then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition. 
Ultrafiltration uses finer filters than microfiltration, which allow lactose and water to pass through while retaining fats, calcium and protein. As with microfiltration, the fat may be removed before filtration and added back in afterwards. Ultrafiltered milk is used in cheesemaking, since it has reduced volume for a given protein content, and is sold directly to consumers as a higher protein, lower sugar content, and creamier alternative to regular milk.  Upon standing for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water.The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. The cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.Milk often is homogenized, a treatment that prevents a cream layer from separating out of the milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than a smaller number of larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. 
Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.  Homogenized milk tastes blander but feels creamier in the mouth than unhomogenized. It is whiter and more resistant to developing off flavors. Creamline (or cream-top) milk is unhomogenized. It may or may not have been pasteurized. Milk that has undergone high-pressure homogenization, sometimes labeled as "ultra-homogenized", has a longer shelf life than milk that has undergone ordinary homogenization at lower pressures. 
Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT) is a type of milk processing where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the package is not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurized. The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. UHT milk does not need to be refrigerated until the package is opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.  The composition of milk differs widely among species. Factors such as the type of protein; the proportion of protein, fat, and sugar; the levels of various vitamins and minerals; and the size of the butterfat globules, and the strength of the curd are among those that may vary. For example: 
Human milk contains, on average, 1.1% protein, 4.2% fat, 7.0% lactose (a sugar), and supplies 72 kcal of energy per 100 grams.  Cow's milk contains, on average, 3.4% protein, 3.6% fat, and 4.6% lactose, 0.7% minerals and supplies 66 kcal of energy per 100 grams. See also Nutritional value further onDonkey and horse milk have the lowest fat content, while the milk of seals and whales may contain more than 50% fat. 
These compositions vary by breed, animal, and point in the lactation period.  The protein range for these four breeds is 3.3% to 3.9%, while the lactose range is 4.7% to 4.9%.Milk fat percentages may be manipulated by dairy farmers' stock diet formulation strategies. The infection known as mastitis, especially in dairy cattle, can cause fat levels to decline. 
Processed cow's milk was formulated to contain differing amounts of fat during the 1950s. One cup (250 mL) of 2%-fat cow's milk contains 285 mg of calcium, which represents 22% to 29% of the daily recommended intake (DRI) of calcium for an adult. Depending on its age, milk contains 8 grams of protein, and a number of other nutrients (either naturally or through fortification) including:  Biotin 
Iodine  Magnesium 
Pantothenic acid  Potassium 
Riboflavin  Selenium 
Thiamine  Vitamin A 
Vitamin B12  Vitamins D 
Vitamin K  Zinc 
The mammary gland is thought to have derived from apocrine skin glands. It has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was keeping eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals). The original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition or immunological protection. This secretion gradually became more copious and accrued nutritional complexity over evolutionary time.Tritylodontid cynodonts seem to have displayed lactation, based on their dental replacement patterns.  Since November 1993, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST), also called rBGH, has been sold to dairy farmers with FDA approval. Cows produce bovine growth hormone naturally, but some producers administer an additional recombinant version of BGH which is produced through genetically engineered E. coli to increase milk production. Bovine growth hormone also stimulates liver production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization have reported that both of these compounds are safe for human consumption at the amounts present. 
Milk from cows given rBST may be sold in the United States, and the FDA stated that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and that from non-rBST-treated cows. Milk that advertises that it comes from cows not treated with rBST, is required to state this finding on its label.  Cows receiving rBGH supplements may more frequently contract an udder infection known as mastitis. Problems with mastitis have led to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan banning milk from rBST treated cows. Mastitis, among other diseases, may be responsible for the fact that levels of white blood cells in milk vary naturally.rBGH is also banned in the European Union, for reasons of animal welfare. 
Milk products are sold in a number of varieties based on types/degrees of:  additives (e.g. vitamins, flavorings) 
age (e.g. cheddar, old cheddar)  coagulation (e.g. cottage cheese) 
farming method (e.g. organic, grass-fed, haymilk)  fat content (e.g. half and half, 3% fat milk, 2% milk, 1% milk, skim milk) 
fermentation (e.g. buttermilk)  flavoring (e.g. chocolate and strawberry) 
homogenization (e.g. cream top)  packaging (e.g. bottle, carton, bag) 
pasteurization (e.g. raw milk, pasteurized milk)  reduction or elimination of lactose 
species (e.g. cow, goat, sheep)  sweetening (e.g., chocolate and strawberry milk) 
water content (e.g. dry milk powder, condensed milk, ultrafiltered milk)Milk preserved by the UHT process does not need to be refrigerated before opening and has a much longer shelf life (six months) than milk in ordinary packaging. It is typically sold unrefrigerated in the UK, U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Australia.  Lactose-free milk can be produced by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk. 
Finland, where approximately 17% of the Finnish-speaking population has hypolactasia, has had "HYLA" (acronym for hydrolyzed lactose) products available for many years. Lactose of low-lactose level cow's milk products, ranging from ice cream to cheese, is enzymatically hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose. The ultra-pasteurization process, combined with aseptic packaging, ensures a long shelf life. In 2001, Valio launched a lactose-free milk drink that is not sweet like HYLA milk but has the fresh taste of ordinary milk. Valio patented the chromatographic separation method to remove lactose. Valio also markets these products in Sweden, Estonia, Belgium, and the United States, where the company says ultrafiltration is used.In the UK, where an estimated 4.7% of the population are affected by lactose intolerance, Lactofree produces milk, cheese, and yogurt products that contain only 0.03% lactose.  To aid digestion in those with lactose intolerance, milk with added bacterial cultures such as Lactobacillus acidophilus ("acidophilus milk") and bifidobacteria ("a/B milk") is available in some areas. Another milk with Lactococcus lactis bacteria cultures ("cultured buttermilk") often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk, which has become rare due to the ubiquity of pasteurization, which also kills the naturally occurring Lactococcus bacteria.Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk can also be produced via ultra filtration, which removes smaller molecules such as lactose and water while leaving calcium and proteins behind. Milk produced via these methods has a lower sugar content than regular milk. 
In areas where the cattle (and often the people) live indoors, commercially sold milk commonly has vitamin D added to it to make up for lack of exposure to UVB radiation.  Reduced-fat milks often have added vitamin A palmitate to compensate for the loss of the vitamin during fat removal; in the United States this results in reduced fat milks having a higher vitamin A content than whole milk.Milk often has flavoring added to it for better taste or as a means of improving sales. Chocolate milk has been sold for many years and has been followed more recently by strawberry milk and others. Some nutritionists have criticized flavored milk for adding sugar, usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, to the diets of children who are already commonly obese in the U.S. 
Due to the short shelf life of normal milk, it used to be delivered to households daily in many countries; however, improved refrigeration at home, changing food shopping patterns because of supermarkets, and the higher cost of home delivery mean that daily deliveries by a milkman are no longer available in most countries.  In Australia and New Zealand, prior to metrication, milk was generally distributed in 1 pint (568 mL) glass bottles. In Australia and Ireland there was a government funded "free milk for school children" program, and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles. With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500 mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons. A number of designs were used, including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space, and could not be knocked over accidentally (slogan: "No more crying over spilt milk"). However, the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the United States.Milk is now available in a variety of sizes in paperboard milk cartons (250 mL, 375 mL, 600 mL, 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1, 2 and 3 liters). A significant addition to the marketplace has been "long-life" milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons. In urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand, home delivery is still available, though in suburban areas this is often 3 times per week rather than daily. Another significant and popular addition to the marketplace has been flavored milks; for example, as mentioned above, Farmers Union Iced Coffee outsells Coca-Cola in South Australia. 
In rural India, milk is home delivered, daily, by local milkmen carrying bulk quantities in a metal container, usually on a bicycle. In other parts of metropolitan India, milk is usually bought or delivered in plastic bags or cartons via shops or supermarkets.  The current milk chain flow in India is from milk producer to milk collection agent. Then it is transported to a milk chilling center and bulk transported to the processing plant, then to the sales agent and finally to the consumer. 
A 2011 survey by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India found that nearly 70% of samples had not conformed to the standards set for milk. The study found that due to lack of hygiene and sanitation in milk handling and packaging, detergents (used during cleaning operations) were not washed properly and found their way into the milk. About 8% of samples in the survey were found to have detergents, which are hazardous to health.  In Pakistan, milk is supplied in jugs. Milk has been a staple food, especially among the pastoral tribes in this country. 
Since the late 1990s, milk-buying patterns have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) during the early hours and delivers milk in 1-pint glass bottles with aluminum foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two of the main reasons for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is the same as it was in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).Almost 95% of all milk in the UK is thus sold in shops today, most of it in plastic bottles of various sizes, but some also in milk cartons. Milk is hardly ever sold in glass bottles in UK shops.  In the United States, glass milk bottles have been replaced mostly with milk cartons and plastic jugs. Gallons of milk are almost always sold in jugs, while half gallons and quarts may be found in both paper cartons and plastic jugs, and smaller sizes are almost always in cartons. 
The "half pint" (237 mL, 5⁄12 imp pt) milk carton is the traditional unit as a component of school lunches, though some companies have replaced that unit size with a plastic bottle, which is also available at retail in 6- and 12-pack size.  Glass milk bottles are now rare. Most people purchase milk in bags, plastic bottles, or plastic-coated paper cartons. Ultraviolet (UV) light from fluorescent lighting can alter the flavor of milk, so many companies that once distributed milk in transparent or highly translucent containers are now using thicker materials that block the UV light. 
Milk comes in a variety of containers with local variants:  Argentina 
Commonly sold in 1-liter bags and cardboard boxes. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.  Australia and New Zealand 
Distributed in a variety of sizes, most commonly in aseptic cartons for up to 1.5 liters, and plastic screw-top bottles beyond that with the following volumes; 1.1 L, 2 L, and 3 L. 1-liter milk bags are starting to appear in supermarkets, but have not yet proved popular. Most UHT-milk is packed in 1 or 2 liter paper containers with a sealed plastic spout.  Brazil 
Used to be sold in cooled 1-liter bags, just like in South Africa. Today the most common form is 1-liter aseptic cartons containing UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic bags are still in use for pasteurized milk. Higher grades of pasteurized milk can be found in cartons or plastic bottles. Sizes other than 1-liter are rare.  Canada 
1.33 liter plastic bags (sold as 4 liters in 3 bags) are widely available in some areas (especially the Maritimes, Ontario and Quebec), although the 4 liter plastic jug has supplanted them in western Canada. Other common packaging sizes are 2 liter, 1 liter, 500 mL, and 250 mL cartons, as well as 4 liter, 1 liter, 250 mL aseptic cartons and 500 mL plastic jugs.  Chile 
Distributed most commonly in aseptic cartons for up to 1 liter, but smaller, snack-sized cartons are also popular. The most common flavors, besides the natural presentation, are chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.  China 
Sweetened milk is a drink popular with students of all ages and is often sold in small plastic bags complete with straw. Adults not wishing to drink at a banquet often drink milk served from cartons or milk tea.  Colombia 
Sells milk in 1-liter plastic bags.  Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro 
UHT milk (trajno mlijeko/trajno mleko/трајно млеко) is sold in 500 mL and 1 L (sometimes also 200 mL) aseptic cartons. Non-UHT pasteurized milk (svježe mlijeko/sveže mleko/свеже млеко) is most commonly sold in 1 L and 1.5 L PET bottles, though in Serbia one can still find milk in plastic bags.  Estonia 
Commonly sold in 1 L bags or 0.33 L, 0.5 L, 1 L or 1.5 L cartons.  Parts of Europe 
Sizes of 500 mL, 1 liter (the most common), 1.5 liters, 2 liters and 3 liters are commonplace.  Finland 
Commonly sold in 1 L or 1.5 L cartons, in some places also in 2 dl and 5 dl cartons.  Germany 
Commonly sold in 1-liter cartons. Sale in 1-liter plastic bags (common in the 1980s) is now rare.  Hong Kong 
Milk is sold in glass bottles (220 mL), cartons (236 mL and 1 L), plastic jugs (2 liters) and aseptic cartons (250 mL).  India 
Commonly sold in 500 mL plastic bags and in bottles in some parts like in the West. It is still customary to serve the milk boiled, despite pasteurization. Milk is often buffalo milk. Flavored milk is sold in most convenience stores in waxed cardboard containers. Convenience stores also sell many varieties of milk (such as flavored and ultra-pasteurized) in various sizes, usually in aseptic cartons.  Indonesia 
Usually sold in 1-liter cartons, but smaller, snack-sized cartons are available.  Italy 
Commonly sold in 1-liter cartons or bottles and less commonly in 0.5 or 0.25-liter cartons. Whole milk, semi-skimmed milk, skimmed, lactose-free, and flavored (usually in small packages) milk is available. Milk is sold fresh or UHT. Goat's milk is also available in small amounts. UHT semi-skimmed milk is the most sold, but cafés use almost exclusively fresh whole milk.  Japan 
Commonly sold in 1-liter waxed paperboard cartons. In most city centers there is also home delivery of milk in glass jugs. As seen in China, sweetened and flavored milk drinks are commonly seen in vending machines.  Kenya 
Milk in Kenya is mostly sold in plastic-coated aseptic paper cartons supplied in 300 mL, 500 mL or 1 liter volumes. In rural areas, milk is stored in plastic bottles or gourds. The standard unit of measuring milk quantity in Kenya is a liter.  Pakistan 
Milk is supplied in 500 mL plastic bags and carried in jugs from rural to cities for selling  Philippines 
Milk is supplied in 1000 mL plastic bottles and delivered from factories to cities for selling.  Poland 
UHT milk is mostly sold in aseptic cartons (500 mL, 1 L, 2 L), and non-UHT in 1 L plastic bags or plastic bottles. Milk, UHT is commonly boiled, despite being pasteurized.  South Africa 
Commonly sold in 1-liter bags. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.  South Korea 
Sold in cartons (180 mL, 200 mL, 500 mL 900 mL, 1 L, 1.8 L, 2.3 L), plastic jugs (1 L and 1.8 L), aseptic cartons (180 mL and 200 mL) and plastic bags (1 L).  SwedenCommonly sold in 0.3 L, 1 L or 1.5 L cartons and sometimes as plastic or glass milk bottles. 
Turkey  Commonly sold in 500 mL or 1L cartons or special plastic bottles. UHT milk is more popular. Milkmen also serve in smaller towns and villages. 
United Kingdom  Most stores stock imperial sizes: 1 pint (568 mL), 2 pints (1.136 L), 4 pints (2.273 L), 6 pints (3.408 L) or a combination including both metric and imperial sizes. Glass milk bottles delivered to the doorstep by the milkman are typically pint-sized and are returned empty by the householder for repeated reuse. Milk is sold at supermarkets in either aseptic cartons or HDPE bottles. Supermarkets have also now begun to introduce milk in bags, to be poured from a proprietary jug and nozzle.[[United StatesCommonly sold in gallon (3.78 L), half-gallon (1.89 L) and quart (0.94 L) containers of natural-colored HDPE resin, or, for sizes less than one gallon, cartons of waxed paperboard. Bottles made of opaque PET are also becoming commonplace for smaller, particularly metric, sizes such as one liter. The U.S. single-serving size is usually the half-pint (about 240 mL). Less frequently, dairies deliver milk directly to consumers, from coolers filled with glass bottles which are typically half-gallon sized and returned for reuse. Some convenience store chains in the United States (such as Kwik Trip in the Midwest) sell milk in half-gallon bags, while another rectangular cube gallon container design used for easy stacking in shipping and displaying is used by warehouse clubs such as Costco and Sam's Club, along with some Walmart stores. 
Uruguay  Pasteurized milk is commonly sold in 1-liter bags and ultra-pasteurized milk is sold in cardboard boxes called Tetra Briks. Non-pasteurized milk is forbidden. Until the 1960s no treatment was applied; milk was sold in bottles. As of 2017, plastic jugs used for pouring the bags, or "sachets", are in common use.Practically everywhere, condensed milk and evaporated milk are distributed in metal cans, 250 and 125 mL paper containers and 100 and 200 mL squeeze tubes, and powdered milk (skim and whole) is distributed in boxes or bags. 
Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have symptoms due to deficiency or absence of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine, causing poor absorption of milk lactose. People affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop, which may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea.Severity depends on the amount of milk consumed. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.  Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is an immunologically mediated adverse reaction, rarely fatal, to one or more cow's milk proteins. 2.2–3.5% of the global infant population are allergic to cow's milk. 
When raw milk is left standing for a while, it turns "sour". This is the result of fermentation, where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp., etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency. Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and kumis. See Dairy product for more information.  Pasteurization of cow's milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life, but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption. This causes it to assume an unpleasant odor, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and an increased risk of food poisoning. In raw milk, the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing acidity in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed. 
In order to prevent spoilage, milk can be kept refrigerated and stored between 1 and 4 °C (34 and 39 °F) in bulk tanks. Most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from factory farms to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. Milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic "cooked" taste. Condensed milk, made by removing most of the water, can be stored in cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can evaporated milk.  The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water. The moisture content is usually less than 5% in both drum- and spray-dried powdered milk. 
Freezing of milk can cause fat globule aggregation upon thawing, resulting in milky layers and butterfat lumps. These can be dispersed again by warming and stirring the milk. It can change the taste by destruction of milk-fat globule membranes, releasing oxidized flavors.  Milk is used to make yogurt, cheese, ice milk, pudding, hot chocolate and french toast, among many other products. Milk is often added to dry breakfast cereal, porridge and granola. Milk is mixed with ice cream and flavored syrups in a blender to make milkshakes. Milk is often served in coffee and tea. Frothy steamed milk is used to prepare espresso-based drinks such as cafe latte. 
The importance of milk in human culture is attested to by the numerous expressions embedded in our languages, for example, "the milk of human kindness", the expression "there's no use crying over spilt milk" (which means don't "be unhappy about what cannot be undone"), "don't milk the ram" (this means "to do or attempt something futile") and "Why buy a cow when you can get milk for free?" (which means "why pay for something that you can get for free otherwise").In Greek mythology, the Milky Way was formed after the trickster god Hermes suckled the infant Heracles at the breast of Hera, the queen of the gods, while she was asleep. When Hera awoke, she tore Heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across the heavens. In another version of the story, Athena, the patron goddess of heroes, tricked Hera into suckling Heracles voluntarily, but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away, spraying milk everywhere.In many African and Asian countries, butter is traditionally made from fermented milk rather than cream. It can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.Holy books have also mentioned milk. The Bible contains references to the "Land of Milk and Honey" as a metaphor for the bounty of the Promised Land. In the Qur'an, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: "And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers" (16-The Honeybee, 66). The Ramadan fast is traditionally broken with a glass of milk and dates.  Abhisheka is conducted by Hindu and Jain priests, by pouring libations on the idol of a deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras. Usually offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed. 
A milksop is an "effeminate spiritless man," an expression which is attested to in the late 14th century. Milk toast is a dish consisting of milk and toast. Its soft blandness served as inspiration for the name of the timid and ineffectual comic strip character Caspar Milquetoast, drawn by H. T. Webster from 1924 to 1952. Thus, the term "milquetoast" entered the language as the label for a timid, shrinking, apologetic person. Milk toast also appeared in Disney's Follow Me Boys as an undesirable breakfast for the aging main character Lem Siddons.  To "milk" someone, in the vernacular of many English-speaking countries, is to take advantage of the person, by analogy to the way a farmer "milks" a cow and takes its milk. The word "milk" has had many slang meanings over time. In the 19th century, milk was used to describe a cheap and very poisonous alcoholic drink made from methylated spirits (methanol) mixed with water. The word was also used to mean defraud, to be idle, to intercept telegrams addressed to someone else, and a weakling or "milksop." In the mid-1930s, the word was used in Australia to refer to siphoning gas from a car. 
Besides serving as a beverage or source of food, milk has been described as used by farmers and gardeners as an organic fungicide and fertilizer, however, its effectiveness is debated. Diluted milk solutions have been demonstrated to provide an effective method of preventing powdery mildew on grape vines, while showing it is unlikely to harm the plant.Milk paint is a nontoxic water-based paint. It can be made from milk and lime, generally with pigments added for color. In other recipes, borax is mixed with milk's casein protein in order to activate the casein and as a preservative.  Milk has been used for centuries as a hair and skin treatment. 
Hairstylist Richard Marin states that some women rinse their hair with milk to add a shiny appearance to their hair. Cosmetic chemist Ginger King states that milk can "help exfoliate and remove debris [from skin] and make hair softer. Hairstylist Danny Jelaca states that milk's keratin proteins may "add weight to the hair". Some commercial hair products contain milk.A milk bath is a bath taken in milk rather than just water. Often additives such as oatmeal, honey, and scents such as rose, daisies and essential oils are mixed in. Milk baths use lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, to dissolve the proteins which hold together dead skin cells.  The consumption of milk between species is not unique to humans. Although the occurrence of this utilization is not vastly documented, interspecies consumption of milk has been observed among the red-billed oxpecker —a bird that can perch on the udders of an impala and suck its milk. Seagulls, Sheathbills, Skuas and African feral cats have been reported to directly pilfer milk from the elephant seals’ teats.

The Navajo (; British English: Navaho; Navajo: Diné or Naabeehó) are a Native American people of the Southwestern United States.  At more than 399,494 enrolled tribal members as of 2021, the Navajo Nation is the largest federally recognized tribe in the U.S. (the Cherokee Nation being the second largest); the Navajo Nation has the largest reservation in the country. The reservation straddles the Four Corners region and covers more than 27,000 square miles (70,000 square km) of land in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. The Navajo language is spoken throughout the region, and most Navajos also speak English. 
The states with the largest Navajo populations are Arizona (140,263) and New Mexico (108,306). More than three-quarters of the enrolled Navajo population resides in these two states.Besides the Navajo Nation proper, a small group of ethnic Navajos are members of the federally recognized Colorado River Indian Tribes.  The Navajos are speakers of a Na-Dené Southern Athabaskan language which they call Diné bizaad (lit. 'People's language'). The term Navajo comes from Spanish missionaries and historians who referred to the Pueblo Indians through this term, although they referred to themselves as the Diné, is a compound word meaning up where there is no surface, and then down to where we are on the surface of Mother Earth. The language comprises two geographic, mutually intelligible dialects. The Apache language is closely related to the Navajo Language; the Navajos and Apaches are believed to have migrated from northwestern Canada and eastern Alaska, where the majority of Athabaskan speakers reside. Speakers of various other Athabaskan languages located in Canada may still comprehend the Navajo language despite the geographic and linguistic deviation of the languages. Additionally, some Navajos speak Navajo Sign Language, which is either a dialect or daughter of Plains Sign Talk. Some also speak Plains Sign Talk itself.Archaeological and historical evidence suggests the Athabaskan ancestors of the Navajos and Apaches entered the Southwest around 1400 AD. The Navajo oral tradition is transcribed to retain references to this migration.Initially, the Navajos were largely hunters and gatherers. Later, they adopted farming from Pueblo peoples, growing mainly the traditional "Three Sisters" of corn, beans, and squash. They adopted herding sheep and goats from the Spanish as a main source of trade and food. Meat became essential in the Navajo diet. Sheep became a form of currency and family status. Women began to spin and weave wool into blankets and clothing; they created items of highly valued artistic expression, which were also traded and sold. 
Oral history indicates a long relationship with Pueblo people and a willingness to incorporate Puebloan ideas and linguistic variance. There were long-established trading practices between the groups. Mid-16th century Spanish records recount that the Pueblo exchanged maize and woven cotton goods for bison meat, hides, and stone from Athabaskans traveling to the pueblos or living nearby. In the 18th century, the Spanish reported that the Navajos' maintained large herds of livestock and cultivated large crop areas.Western historians believe that the Spanish before 1600 referred to the Navajos as Apaches or Quechos.: 2–4 Fray Geronimo de Zarate-Salmeron, who was in Jemez in 1622, used Apachu de Nabajo in the 1620s to refer to the people in the Chama Valley region, east of the San Juan River and northwest of present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico. Navahu comes from the Tewa language, meaning a large area of cultivated lands.: 7–8 By the 1640s, the Spanish began using the term Navajo to refer to the Diné.  During the 1670s, the Spanish wrote that the Diné lived in a region known as Dinétah, about 60 miles (97 km) west of the Rio Chama valley region. In the 1770s, the Spanish sent military expeditions against the Navajos in the Mount Taylor and Chuska Mountain regions of New Mexico.: 43–50 The Spanish, Navajos and Hopis continued to trade with each other and formed a loose alliance to fight Apache and Comanche bands for the next 20 years. During this time there were relatively minor raids by Navajo bands and Spanish citizens against each other. 
In 1800 Governor Chacon led 500 men to the Tunicha Mountains against the Navajo. Twenty Navajo chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 the Navajos and Spanish mounted major expeditions against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established. Similar patterns of peace-making, raiding, and trading among the Navajo, Spanish, Apache, Comanche, and Hopi continued until the arrival of Americans in 1846.  The Navajos encountered the United States Army in 1846, when General Stephen W. Kearny invaded Santa Fe with 1,600 men during the Mexican–American War. On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, Narbona and other Navajos negotiated a treaty of peace with Colonel Alexander Doniphan at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of Fort Wingate). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo, nor by some New Mexicans. The Navajos raided New Mexican livestock, New Mexicans took women, children, and livestock from the Navajo.In 1849, the military governor of New Mexico, Colonel John MacRae Washington—accompanied by John S. Calhoun, an Indian agent—led 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating Canyon de Chelly. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. In exchange, the United States, promised "such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper." While en route to sign this treaty, the prominent Navajo peace leader Narbona, was killed, causing hostility between the treaty parties.During the next 10 years, the U.S. established forts on traditional Navajo territory. Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajos from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860–61. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajos call this period Naahondzood, "the fearing time." 
In 1861, Brigadier-General James H. Carleton, Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajos and Apaches. Colonel Kit Carson was at the new Fort Wingate with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia. Carleton ordered Carson to kill Mescalero Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called Bosque Redondo.  In 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajos and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to Fort Defiance for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continued to come in though 1864.However, not all the Navajos came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages, and others lived with Apache bands. 
Beginning in the spring of 1864, the Army forced around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children to walk over 300 miles (480 km) to Fort Sumner, New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide enough water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000–5,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajos froze in the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials they were given. This period is known among the Navajos as "The Fearing Time". In addition, a small group of Mescalero Apache, longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.  In 1868, the Treaty of Bosque Redondo was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajos to return to a reservation on a portion of their former homeland. 
The United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years after the Long Walk. From 1873 to 1895, the military employed Navajos as "Indian Scouts" at Fort Wingate to help their regular units. During this period, Chief Manuelito founded the Navajo Tribal Police. It operated from 1872 to 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.  By treaty, the Navajos were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local Indian agent. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase their livestock and crops. Also, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres (14,000 km2; 5,500 sq mi) to the 16 million acres (65,000 km2; 25,000 sq mi) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consulting the tribe. 
In 1883, Lt. Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajos and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land. In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.  In 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajos at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief. In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.In 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajos a fine of livestock. The Navajos tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajos were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.In 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajos used force to free the women and retreated to Beautiful Mountain with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of Henry Chee Dodge, a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation. 
During the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation. The first Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school opened at Fort Defiance in 1870 and led the way for eight others to be established. Many older Navajos were against this education and would hide their children to keep them from being taken.  Once the children arrived at the boarding school, their lives changed dramatically. European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo. The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the Siláo. In multiple interviews, subjects recalled being captured and disciplined by the Siláo if they tried to run away. Other conditions included inadequate food, overcrowding, required manual labor in kitchens, fields, and boiler rooms; and military-style uniforms and haircuts.Change did not occur in these boarding schools until after the Meriam Report was published in 1929 by the Secretary of Interior, Hubert Work. This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.This report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children. 
In 1937, Boston heiress Mary Cabot Wheelright and Navajo singer and medicine man Hastiin Klah founded the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe. It is a repository for sound recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and sandpainting tapestries of the Navajos. It also featured exhibits to express the beauty, dignity, and logic of Navajo religion. When Klah met Cabot in 1921, he had witnessed decades of efforts by the US government and missionaries to assimilate the Navajos into mainstream society. The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajo, which Klah was sure would otherwise soon be lost forever.  The result of these boarding schools led to much language loss within the Navajo Nation. After the Second World War, the Meriam Report funded more children to attend these schools with six times as many children attending boarding school than before the War. English as the primary language spoken at these schools as well as the local towns surrounding the Navajo reservations contributed to residents becoming bilingual; however Navajo was the still the primary language spoken at home. 
The Navajo Livestock Reduction was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933, during the Great Depression. Under various forms it continued into the 1950s. Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.  In 1933, John Collier was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of "sheep units". In 1930 the Navajos grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units. These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.Collier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the matrilineal and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.The Navajos did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change. They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it. Historian Brian Dippie notes that the Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a "near reign of terror" on the Navajo reservation. Dippie adds that, "He became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him." The long-term result was strong Navajo opposition to Collier's Indian New Deal. 
Many Navajo young people moved to cities to work in urban factories in World War II. Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajos gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.Four hundred Navajo code talkers played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language. The Japanese were unable to understand or decode it.In the 1940s, large quantities of uranium were discovered in Navajo land. From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajos have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.  The Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in USMC history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word "turtle" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted it in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in English faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their efficacy. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. 
Each Navajo went through basic bootcamp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at Camp Pendleton. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers.  These achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans. 
The name "Navajo" comes from the late 18th century via the Spanish (Apaches de) Navajó "(Apaches of) Navajó", which was derived from the Tewa navahū "farm fields adjoining a valley". The Navajos call themselves Diné.Like other Apacheans, the Navajos were semi-nomadic from the 16th through the 20th centuries. Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.  There is a system of clans which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is exogamous: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajos favor their 
children to marry into their father's clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.: xix–xxi Historically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a matrilineal system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a matrilocal residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children. Children are "born to" and belong to the mother's clan, and are "born for" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.Neither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as bride wealth). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship.  See Navajo ethnobotany. 
A hogan, the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house. Hogans are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the kinaaldá, take place inside a hogan. According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, "even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families." Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.Those who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song "The Blessingway" (hózhǫ́ǫ́jí) describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques. Some are maintained specifically for ceremonial purposes.  Navajo spiritual practice is about restoring balance and harmony to a person's life to produce health and is based on the ideas of Hózhóójí. The Diné believed in two classes of people: Earth People and Holy People. The Navajo people believe they passed through three worlds before arriving in this world, the Fourth World or the Glittering World. As Earth People, the Diné must do everything within their power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man. The Diné also had the expectation of keeping a positive relationship between them and the Diyin Diné. In the Diné Bahane' (Navajo beliefs about creation), the First, or Dark World is where the four Diyin Diné lived and where First Woman and First Man came into existence. Because the world was so dark, life could not thrive there and they had to move on. The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or Táshchózhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World. In the Glittering World, true death came into existence, as well as the creations of the seasons, the moon, stars, and the sun.The Holy People, or Diyin Diné, had instructed the Earth People to view the four sacred mountains as the boundaries of the homeland (Dinétah) they should never leave: Blanca Peak (Sisnaajiní — Dawn or White Shell Mountain) in Colorado; Mount Taylor (Tsoodził — Blue Bead or Turquoise Mountain) in New Mexico; the San Francisco Peaks (Dookʼoʼoosłííd — Abalone Shell Mountain) in Arizona; and Hesperus Mountain (Dibé Nitsaa — Big Mountain Sheep) in Colorado. Times of day, as well as colors, are used to represent the four sacred mountains. Throughout religions, the importance of a specific number is emphasized and in the Navajo religion, the number four appears to be sacred to their practices. For example, there were four original clans of Diné, four colors and times of day, four Diyin Diné, and for the most part, four songs sung for a ritual.Navajos have many different ceremonies. For the most part, their ceremonies are to prevent or cure diseases. Corn pollen is used as a blessing and as an offering during prayer. One half of major Navajo song ceremonial complex is the Blessing Way (Hózhǫ́ǫ́jí) and other half is the Enemy Way (Anaʼí Ndááʼ). The Blessing Way ceremonies are based on establishing "peace, harmony, and good things exclusively" within the Dine. The Enemy Way, or Evil Way ceremonies are concerned with counteracting influences that come from outside the Dine. Spiritual healing ceremonies are rooted in Navajo traditional stories. One of them, the Night Chant ceremony, is conducted over several days and involves up to 24 dancers. The ceremony requires the dancers to wear buckskin masks, as do many of the other Navajo ceremonies, and they all represent specific gods. The purpose of the Night Chant is to purify the patients and heal them through prayers to the spirit-beings. Each day of the ceremony entails the performance of certain rites and the creation of detailed sand paintings. One of the songs describes the home of the thunderbirds: 
The ceremonial leader proceeds by asking the Holy People to be present at the beginning of the ceremony, then identifying the patient with the power of the spirit-being, and describing the patient's transformation to renewed health with lines such as, "Happily I recover."Ceremonies are used to correct curses that cause some illnesses or misfortunes. People may complain of witches who do harm to the minds, bodies, and families of innocent people, though these matters are rarely discussed in detail with those outside of the community.  See: Diné Bahane' (Creation Story) and Black God and Coyote (notable traditional characters) 
The Navajo Tribe relied on oral tradition to maintain beliefs and stories. Examples would include the traditional creation story Diné Bahane'. There are also some Navajo Indian legends that are staples in literature, including The First Man and First Woman as well as The Sun, Moon and Stars. The First Man and Woman is a myth about the creation of the world, and The Sun, Moon and Stars is a legend about the origin of heavenly bodies.  Silversmithing is an important art form among Navajos. Atsidi Sani (c. 1830–c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called Nakai Tsosi ("Thin Mexican") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver. By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating handmade jewelry including bracelets, tobacco flasks, necklaces and bracers. Later, they added silver earrings, buckles, bolos, hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.The Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the "squash blossom" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term "squash blossom" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican pomegranate designs. The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the "naja" (najahe in Navajo) symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the "squash blossom" necklace. 
Turquoise has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.  Navajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century, the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with indigo. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by Ute and Plains Indians. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase features red diamonds and partial diamond patterns. 
The completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from Philadelphia, commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.  Some early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying Navajo rugs by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and rugs into distinct styles. These included "Two Gray Hills" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); Teec Nos Pos (colorful, with very extensive patterns); "Ganado" (founded by Don Lorenzo Hubbell), red-dominated patterns with black and white; "Crystal" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and Persian styles (almost always with natural dyes); "Wide Ruins", "Chinlee", banded geometric patterns; "Klagetoh", diamond-type patterns; "Red Mesa" and bold diamond patterns. Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or hózhǫ́. 
In 2000 the documentary The Return of Navajo Boy was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. It was written in response to an earlier film, The Navajo Boy which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. The Return of Navajo Boy allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.In the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show 30 Days, the show's producer Morgan Spurlock spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico. The July 2008 show called "Life on an Indian Reservation", depicts the dire conditions that many Native Americans experience living on reservations in the United States.Tony Hillerman wrote a series of detective novels whose detective characters were members of the Navajo Tribal Police. The novels are noted for incorporating details about Navajo culture, and in some cases expand the focus to include nearby Hopi and Zuni characters and cultures, as well. Four of the novels have been adapted for film/TV. His daughter has continued the novel series after his death.  In 1997, Welsh author Eirug Wyn published the Welsh-language novel "I Ble'r Aeth Haul y Bore?"

Herbermann, Charles, ed. (1913). "Navajo Indians" . Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.  The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations. 
Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit. The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit, or from a side shoot, and typically mature within a year.  The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 11 in) tall, although sometimes it can be taller. The plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves. When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. Once it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit. After the first fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem. These suckers may be removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant. Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated. It has 30 or more narrow, fleshy, trough-shaped leaves that are 30 to 100 cm (1 to 3+1⁄2 ft) long, surrounding a thick stem; the leaves have sharp spines along the margins. In the first year of growth, the axis lengthens and thickens, bearing numerous leaves in close spirals. After 12 to 20 months, the stem grows into a spike-like inflorescence up to 15 cm (6 in) long with over 100 spirally arranged, trimerous flowers, each subtended by a bract. 
The ovaries develop into berries, which coalesce into a large, compact, multiple fruit. The fruit of a pineapple is usually arranged in two interlocking helices, often with 8 in one direction and 13 in the other, each being a Fibonacci number.The pineapple carries out CAM photosynthesis, fixing carbon dioxide at night and storing it as the acid malate, then releasing it during the day aiding photosynthesis.  The pineapple comprises five botanical varieties, formerly regarded as separate species: 
Ananas comosus var. ananassoides  Ananas comosus var. bracteatus 
Ananas comosus var. comosus  Ananas comosus var. erectifolius 
Ananas comosus var. parguazensis  In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats. Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for breeding. In Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the 20th century, importation of hummingbirds was prohibited. 
The first reference in English to the pineapple fruit was the 1568 translation from the French of André Thevet's The New Found World, or Antarctike where he refers to a Hoyriri, a fruit cultivated and eaten by the Tupinambá people, living near modern Rio de Janeiro, and now believed to be a pineapple. Later in the same English translation, he describes the same fruit as a "Nana made in the manner of a Pine apple", where he used another Tupi word nanas, meaning 'excellent fruit'. This usage was adopted by many European languages and led to the plant's scientific binomial Ananas comosus, where comosus 'tufted', refers to the stem of the plant. Purchas, writing in English in 1613, referred to the fruit as Ananas, but the Oxford English Dictionary's first record of the word pineapple itself by an English writer by Mandeville in 1714.  The wild plant originates from the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages between southern Brazil and Paraguay. Little is known about its domestication, but it spread as a crop throughout South America. Archaeological evidence of cultivation/use is found as far back as 1200 - 800 BC (3200-2800 BP) in Peru and 200BC - AD700 (2200-1300 BP) in Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs. By the late 1400s, cropped pineapple was widely distributed and a stable component of the diet of Native Americans. The first European to encounter the pineapple was Columbus, in Guadeloupe on 4 November 1493. The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550. The 'Red Spanish' cultivar was also introduced by the Spanish from Latin America to the Philippines, and it was grown for textile use from at least the 17th century.Columbus brought the plant back to Spain and called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians". The pineapple was documented in Peter Martyr's Decades of the New World (1516) and Antonio Pigafetta's Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524-1525), and the first known illustration was in Oviedo's Historia General de Las Indias (1535). 
The pineapple fascinated Europeans as a fruit of colonialism. But it was not successfully cultivated in Europe until Pieter de la Court developed greenhouse horticulture near Leiden from about 1658. Pineapple plants were distributed from the Netherlands to English gardeners in 1719 and French ones in 1730. In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove" to heat the plants was built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723. In France, King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. In Russia, Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on her own estates before 1796.Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, in greenhouses called "pineries", pineapple became a symbol of wealth. They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot. In the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates became the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats. John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 metres tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple. In architecture, pineapple figures became decorative elements symbolizing hospitality.  Many different varieties, mostly from the Antilles, were tried for European glasshouse cultivation. The most significant was "Smooth Cayenne", imported to France in 1820, subsequently re-exported to the UK in 1835, and then from the UK via Hawaii to Australia and Africa. "Smooth Cayenne" is now the dominant cultivar in world production. Jams and sweets based on pineapple were imported to Europe from the West Indies, Brazil, and Mexico from an early date. By the early 19th century, fresh pineapples were transported direct from the West Indies in large enough quantities to reduce European prices. Later pineapple production was dominated by the Azores for Europe, and Florida and the Caribbean for North America, because of the short trade routes. 
The Spanish had introduced the pineapple into Hawaii in the 18th century where it is known as the hala kahiki ("foreign hala"), but the first commercial plantation was established in 1886. The most famous investor was James Dole, who moved to Hawaii in 1899 and started a 24-hectare (60-acre) pineapple plantation in 1900 which would grow into the Dole Food Company. Dole and Del Monte began growing pineapples on the island of Oahu in 1901 and 1917, respectively, and the Maui Pineapple Company began cultivation on Maui in 1909. James Dole began the commercial processing of pineapple, and Dole employee Henry Ginaca invented an automatic peeling and coring machine in 1911.  Hawaiian production started to decline from the 1970s because of competition and the shift to refrigerated sea transport. Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii. In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's production. Despite this decline, the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii. Further, foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.In the Philippines, "Smooth Cayenne" was introduced in the early 1900s by the US Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period. Dole and Del Monte established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the 1920s; in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon, respectively. Large scale canning had started in Southeast Asia, including in the Philippines, from 1920. This trade was severely damaged by World War II, and Hawaii dominated the international trade until the 1960s. 
The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world. The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed, after Del Monte Pacific Ltd., a Filipino company, completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in 2014.  The flesh and juice of the pineapple are used in cuisines around the world. In many tropical countries, pineapple is prepared and sold on roadsides as a snack. It is sold whole or in halves with a stick inserted. Whole, cored slices with a cherry in the middle are a common garnish on hams in the West. Chunks of pineapple are used in desserts such as fruit salad, as well as in some savory dishes, including pizza toppings, or as a grilled ring on a hamburger. Traditional dishes that use pineapple include hamonado, afritada, kaeng som pla, and Hawaiian haystack. Crushed pineapple is used in yogurt, jam, sweets, and ice cream. The juice of the pineapple is served as a beverage, and it is also the main ingredient in cocktails such as the piña colada and in the drink tepache. 
In the Philippines, a traditional jelly-like dessert called nata de piña has also been produced since the 18th century. It is made by fermenting pineapple juice with Komagataeibacter xylinus.Pineapple vinegar is an ingredient found in Honduran, and Filipino cuisine, where it is produced locally. In Mexico it is usually made with peels from the whole fruit, rather than the juice, but in Taiwanese cuisine it is often produced by blending pineapple juice with grain vinegar.The European Union consumed 50% of global total for pineapple juice in 2012–2016. The Netherlands was the largest importer of pineapple juice in Europe. Thailand, Costa Rica and the Netherlands are the major suppliers to the European Union market in 2012–2016. Countries consuming the most pineapple juice in 2017 were Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, having combined consumption of 47% of the world total. From 2007 to 2017, the largest growth in pineapple juice consumption was by Angola. The consumption of pineapple juice in China and India is low compared to their populations.  Raw pineapple pulp is 86% water, 13% carbohydrates, 0.5% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 100-gram reference amount, raw pineapple supplies 209 kilojoules (50 kilocalories) of food energy, and is a rich source of manganese (44% Daily Value, DV) and vitamin C (58% DV), but otherwise contains no micronutrients in significant amounts. 
In 2020, world production of pineapples was 28 million tonnes, led by the Philippines, Costa Rica, Brazil, Indonesia, and China as the largest producers.  In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits. Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow. Slips and suckers are planted commercially. 
Like most modern fruit production, pineapple plantations are highly industrialized operations. In Costa Rica particularly, the pineapple industry uses large amounts of insecticides to protect the crop, which have caused health problems in many workers. These workers often receive little compensation, and are mostly poor migrants, often Nicaraguan. Workers' wages also decrease every time prices are lowered overseas. In 2016, the government declared that it would be trying to improve the situation, with the help of various other groups.Historically, tropical fruit agriculture, such as for pineapples, has been concentrated in so-called "banana republics."  Export pineapples from Costa Rica to Europe are recurrently used as a cover vehicle for narcotrafficking, and its containers are impounded routinely in either location. 
In Costa Rica, pineapple cultivation has expanded into the Maquenque, Corredor Fronterizo, Barra del Colorado and Caño Negro wildlife refuges, all located in the north of the country. As those are protected areas and not national parks, limited and restricted sustainable activities are allowed, however pineapple plantations are industrial operations and many of these don't have the proper license to operate in the protected areas, or were started before either the designation of the area, recent regulations or the creation of the environmental regulatory agency (Setena) in 1996. The agency has registers for around 358.5 ha (1.384 sq mi) of pineapple plantations operating within protected areas, but satellite imagery from 2018 reports around 1,659 ha (6.41 sq mi).  Many cultivars are known. The leaves of the commonly grown "smooth cayenne" are smooth, and it is the most commonly grown worldwide. Many cultivars have become distributed from its origins in Paraguay and the southern part of Brazil, and later improved stocks were introduced into the Americas, the Azores, Africa, India, Malaysia and Australia. Varieties include: 
"Hilo" is a compact, 1.0- to 1.5-kg (2– to 3-lb) Hawaiian variant of smooth cayenne; the fruit is more cylindrical and produces many suckers, but no slips.  "Kona sugarloaf", at 2.5 to 3.0 kg (5–6 lb), has white flesh with no woodiness in the center, is cylindrical in shape, and has a high sugar content but no acid; it has an unusually sweet fruit. 
"Natal queen", at 1.0 to 1.5 kg (2 to 3 lb), has golden yellow flesh, crisp texture, and delicate mild flavor; well-adapted to fresh consumption, it keeps well after ripening. It has spiny leaves, and is grown in Australia, Malaysia, and South Africa.  "Pernambuco" ("eleuthera") weighs 1–2 kg (2–4 lb), and has pale yellow to white flesh. It is sweet, melting in texture, and excellent for eating fresh; it is poorly adapted for shipping, has spiny leaves, and is grown in Latin America. 
"Red Spanish", at 1–2 kg (2–4 lb), has pale yellow flesh with a pleasant aroma, is squarish in shape, and well-adapted for shipping as fresh fruit to distant markets; it has spiny leaves and is grown in Latin America and the Philippines. It was the original pineapple cultivar in the Philippines grown for their leaf fibers (piña) in the traditional Philippine textile industry.  "Smooth cayenne", a 2.5- to 3.0-kg (5- to 6-lb), pale yellow– to yellow-fleshed, cylindrical fruit with high sugar and acid content, is well-adapted to canning and processing; its leaves are without spines. It is an ancient cultivar developed by Amerind peoples. In some parts of Asia, this cultivar is known as Sarawak, after an area of Malaysia in which it is grown. It is one of the ancestors of cultivars "73-50" (also called "MD-1" and "CO-2") and "73–114" (also called "MD-2"). Smooth cayenne was previously the variety produced in Hawaii, and the most easily obtainable in U.S. grocery stores, but was replaced over the course of the mid-1990s and 2000s by MD-2. 
Some Ananas species are grown as ornamentals for color, novel fruit size, and other aesthetic qualities.In the US, in 1986, the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple. Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'.  The variety A. comosus 'Variegatus' is occasionally grown as a houseplant. It needs direct sunlight, and thrives at temperatures of 18 to 24 °C (64 to 75 °F) with a minimum winter temperature of 16 °C (61 °F). It should be kept humid, but the soil should be allowed to dry out between waterings. It has almost no resting period but should be repotted each spring until the container reaches 20 centimeters (8 in). 
Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals, among which are polyphenols, including gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and arbutin.  Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes. It is present in stem, fruit, crown, core, leaves of pineapple itself. Bromelain is under preliminary research for treatment of a variety of clinical disorders, but has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body. Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer. Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning. The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing. 
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups. Other diseases include citrus pink disease, bacterial heart rot, anthracnose, fungal heart rot, root rot, black rot, butt rot, fruitlet core rot, and yellow spot virus.  Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process. The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pantoea citrea and Tatumella ptyseos.Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids.Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants. The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions. Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds. 
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green. A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow. After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative. A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.  The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines. The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abacá. These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado. The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries. Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong tagalog, baro't saya, and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo). They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands. The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.

Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.  Pink Floyd were founded in 1964 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars); Klose quit in 1965. Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. 
Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both albums before entering a long period of inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions.  By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Wish You Were Here, The Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall are among the best-selling albums of all time, and the latter two have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five of their albums topped the UK Album Chart. Hit singles include "See Emily Play" (1967), "Money" (1973), "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (1979), "Not Now John" (1983), "On the Turning Away" (1987) and "High Hopes" (1994). The band also composed several film scores. They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music. 
Roger Waters and Nick Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard). The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King became their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £19,000 in 2020) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming Pink Floyd. Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday Times which stated: "At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic."In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance was not music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. The band was much better received at the UFO Club in London, where they began to build a fan base. Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, "leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none of the others could do", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner.  In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry. While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's booking agent Bryan Morrison arranged and funded a recording session at Sound Techniques in Kensington. Three days later, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (equivalent to £92,800 in 2020). EMI released the band's first single, "Arnold Layne", with the B-side "Candy and a Currant Bun", on 10 March 1967 on its Columbia label. Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967. "Arnold Layne"'s references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number 20.EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, "See Emily Play", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than "Arnold Layne", peaking at number 6 in the UK. The band performed on the BBC's Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and around this time the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and Mason described him as "completely distanced from everything going on". 
Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract. As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: "I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by giving terse answers to questions (or not responding at all) and staring into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime "See Emily Play" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued.  In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set.Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (equivalent to £500 in 2020). In January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member, intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would "cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities". When this proved unworkable, it was decided that Barrett would just write material. In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", instead introduced "Have You Got It Yet?" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photoshoot of Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was "Nah, let's not bother", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later said, "He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him." In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.Jenner and King believed Barrett was the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as "It Would Be So Nice" and "Careful with That Axe, Eugene". 
In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, "Jugband Blues". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", "Let There Be More Light" and "Corporal Clegg". Wright composed "See-Saw" and "Remember a Day". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on "Remember a Day", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, "Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking "like an architectural diagram".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to "forget it as background music to a party". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as "like a religious experience", while NME described the song as "long and boring ... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they returned to the US for a second visit. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who, it marked Pink Floyd's first significant tour. In December of that year, they released "Point Me at the Sky"; no more successful than the two singles they had released since "See Emily Play", it would be the band's last until their 1973 release (in limited territories, not including the UK), "Money".  Ummagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work. Released as a double-LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member. Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and received positive reviews. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart. 
In October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in England in mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound problems. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was "A neat way of saying that he didn't ... do anything". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour once described it as "a load of rubbish", stating: "I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period." Pink Floyd's first number- one album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden.  In January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd began working on new material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, "during which time nothing would get [accomplished]. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints". The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.Meddle was released in October 1971, and reached number three, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart. It marks a transition between the Barrett-led group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd; Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone wrote that "not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again". NME called it "an exceptionally good album", singling out "Echoes" as the "Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for". However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album "a soundtrack to a non-existent movie", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as "so much sound and fury, signifying nothing". 
Pink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the lyrics.  Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described side one as "utterly confused ... [and] difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: "The songs, the sounds ... [and] the rhythms were solid ... [the] saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled". Rolling Stone's Loyd Grossman described it as "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement."Throughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time; a US number-one, it remained on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart for more than fourteen years during the 1970s and 1980s, selling more than 45 million copies worldwide. In Britain, the album peaked at number 2, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart. The Dark Side of the Moon is the world's third best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. Disenchanted with their US record company, Capitol Records, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with Columbia Records, who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000 (US$5,247,638 in 2020 dollars). In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records. 
After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as "falling within a difficult period" and Waters found them "tortuous". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd."While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US.  In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm. The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there." Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: "This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three. NME described the album as "one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music", and Melody Maker's Karl Dallas called it "[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific".Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their "In the Flesh" tour. It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit. At the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish. 
In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former. Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.During the recording of The Wall, the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him. Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little". According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions "without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to "have a long battle" or agree to "leave quietly" after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left.The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since "Money", "Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)", which topped the charts in the US and the UK. The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK. It is tied for sixth most certified album by RIAA, with 23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis.Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the "Mother", the "Ex-wife" and the "Schoolmaster". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances. Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,707,980 in 2020 dollars).The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall. The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue. Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall's storyline as "bollocks". Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982.  In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: "I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut." Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it "a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece". Loder viewed The Final Cut as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album". 
Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984). Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Gilmour, Mason, Waters and O'Rourke met for dinner in 1984 to discuss their future. Mason and Gilmour left the restaurant thinking that Pink Floyd could continue after Waters had finished The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, noting that they had had several hiatuses before; however, Waters left believing that Mason and Gilmour had accepted that Pink Floyd were finished. Mason said that Waters later saw the meeting as "duplicity rather than diplomacy", and wrote in his memoir: "Clearly, our communication skills were still troublingly nonexistent. We left the restaurant with diametrically opposed views of what had been decided."Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively".When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987. In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members.  In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence "would make us stronger legally and musically", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000.Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore. Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been "destroyed by Roger", and their contributions were minimal. 
A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: "I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate." Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all." Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where the band worked from February to May 1993.Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, "It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album." However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson, is also credited; she helped Gilmour write several tracks, including "High Hopes", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, "pulled the whole album together", according to Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: "the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger". To avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart.Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994. Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd, in 2004. 
On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London. The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event.They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event. At the beginning of their performance of "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: "[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: "The [Live 8] rehearsals convinced me [that] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it." In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which declared: "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: "It's over ... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own." Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite.  Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. Wright said: "The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire." Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert "Madcap's Last Laugh" at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions "Bike" and "Arnold Layne", and Waters performed a solo version of his song "Flickering Flame".Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said that Wright's contributions were often overlooked, and that his "soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound". A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed "Remember a Day" from A Saucerful of Secrets, written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland. Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the "backbone" of Pink Floyd. 
On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kidlington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed "Comfortably Numb" at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos. Mason also joined, playing tambourine for "Outside the Wall" with Gilmour on mandolin.On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including "Experience" and "Immersion" multi-disc multi-format editions. The albums were remastered by James Guthrie, co-producer of The Wall. In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings, comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was."The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014. Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries. The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997. Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: "I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end." There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright. In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were "done" and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong. Mason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, they remained "at loggerheads".In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972, comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career. It was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years, compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure. The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder. In November 2020, the reissue of Delicate Sound of Thunder was given a standalone release on multiple formats. Pink Floyd's Live at Knebworth 1990 performance, previously released as part of the Later Years box set, was released on CD and vinyl on 30 April.In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets, to perform Pink Floyd's early material. The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt. They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019. Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". 
Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club). According to Rolling Stone: "By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music." Released in 1968, the song "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group. Other genres attributed to the band are space rock, experimental rock, acid rock, proto-prog, experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop, and psychedelic rock. O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance. 
During the late 1960s, the press labelled Pink Floyd's music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock; they gained a following as a psychedelic pop group. In 1968, Wright said: "It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." Waters said later: "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing 'Interstellar Overdrive' for hours and hours." Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen". Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time. In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound ... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows." Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on "Money", "Time" and "Comfortably Numb" "cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog." Brown described the "Time" solo as "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... [to get] singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade." 
Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, "See Emily Play" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as "On the Run", "Welcome to the Machine", and "In the Flesh?". He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for "One of These Days".Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.  Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee. In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More. The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later became "Us and Them", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds. They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart. 
Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground.To celebrate the launch of the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called "Moonhead".In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.During the Division Bell Tour, an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word "enigma" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band.  Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as "purveyors of a distinctively dark vision". Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: "their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference." Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. Author George Reisch described Meddle's psychedelic opus, "Echoes", as "built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others." Despite having been labelled "the gloomiest man in rock", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics. 
Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's "Have a Cigar" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes "Pink" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the "dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." Waters commented: "it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to "Comfortably Numb": "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, "Jugband Blues": "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here."  Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" of Dark Side with The Wall's portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.The album's characters include the "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the "Sheep", who represent the exploited. Croskery described the "Sheep" as being in a "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: "You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too." However, he also acknowledges that the "Pigs" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a "Dog" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them. 
O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon's "Brain Damage" with Karl Marx's theory of self-alienation; "there's someone in my head, but it's not me." The lyrics to Wish You Were Here's "Welcome to the Machine" suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals; the "Dog" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. The "Dogs" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a "necessary and defensible" position in "a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle" wrote Detmer. Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall.War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall, and a recurring theme in the band's music. Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from "Corporal Clegg" (1968), "Free Four" (1972), "Us and Them" (1973), "When the Tigers Broke Free" and "The Fletcher Memorial Home" from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream. The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women.Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it "an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative." Reisch described The Wall as "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness." The Wall's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is "crazy, over the rainbow". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: "have I been guilty all this time?" Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.  Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993. The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million.In 2003, Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included The Dark Side of the Moon at number 43, The Wall at number 87, Wish You Were Here at number 209, and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn at number 347. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Rolling Stone included "Comfortably Numb" at number 314, "Wish You Were Here" at number 316, and "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" at number 375.In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of "The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever". In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to "a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart". Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time". VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, "Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata [...] Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists." The writer Eric Olsen has called Pink Floyd "the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era".Pink Floyd have won several awards. In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for "Best Engineered Non-Classical Album" for The Wall, and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for "Best Original Song Written for a Film" in 1983 for "Another Brick in the Wall" from The Wall film. In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" for "Marooned". In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010.Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists. David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to "Dogs" from Animals. Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen, Radiohead, Steven Wilson, Marillion, Queensrÿche, Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins. Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s. The English rock band Mostly Autumn "fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd" in their sound.Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains, opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive. It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October.

Pink Floyd tour dates at Songkick  Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. 
Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.  Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica.Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold. 
Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.  Snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect (also sea-effect) storms and elevation effects, especially in mountains. 
Mid-latitude cyclones are low-pressure areas which are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild snow storms to heavy blizzards. During a hemisphere's fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall. In the Northern Hemisphere, the northern side of the low-pressure area produces the most snow. For the southern mid-latitudes, the side of a cyclone that produces the most snow is the southern side.  A cold front, the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal convective line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which the line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path, but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low-pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally, it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession separated only by 25 miles (40 kilometers), with each passing the same point roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing, the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow. 
A warm front can produce snow for a period as warm, moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to rain in the warm sector behind the front.  Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes, and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.The same effect occurring over bodies of salt water is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation which may deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts. These include areas east of the Great Lakes, the west coasts of northern Japan, the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, and parts of the northern Atlantic Ocean. 
Orographic or relief snowfall is created when moist air is forced up the windward side of mountain ranges by a large-scale wind flow. The lifting of moist air up the side of a mountain range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is gradually removed from the air by this process, leaving drier and warmer air on the descending, or leeward, side. The resulting enhanced snowfall, along with the decrease in temperature with elevation, combine to increase snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack in snow-prone areas.Mountain waves have also been found to help enhance precipitation amounts downwind of mountain ranges by enhancing the lift needed for condensation and precipitation.  A snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground. As a result, snowflakes differ from each other though they follow similar patterns.Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 μm in diameter) freeze. These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than −18 °C (0 °F), because to freeze, a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice. The droplet freezes around this "nucleus". In warmer clouds, an aerosol particle or "ice nucleus" must be present in (or in contact with) the droplet to act as a nucleus. Ice nuclei are very rare compared to cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form. Clays, desert dust, and biological particles can be nuclei. Artificial nuclei include particles of silver iodide and dry ice, and these are used to stimulate precipitation in cloud seeding.Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. 
Micrography of thousands of snowflakes from 1885 onward, starting with Wilson Alwyn Bentley, revealed the wide diversity of snowflakes within a classifiable set of patterns. Closely matching snow crystals have been observed.Ukichiro Nakaya developed a crystal morphology diagram, relating crystal shapes to the temperature and moisture conditions under which they formed, which is summarized in the following table.  Nakaya discovered that the shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact while crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate, and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form, which include side-planes, bullet-rosettes, and planar types, depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime at around −5 °C (23 °F) and then falls into the warmer plate-like regime, plate or dendritic crystals sprout at the end of the column, producing so called "capped columns".Magono and Lee devised a classification of freshly formed snow crystals that includes 80 distinct shapes. They documented each with micrographs. 
Snow accumulates from a series of snow events, punctuated by freezing and thawing, over areas that are cold enough to retain snow seasonally or perennially. Major snow-prone areas include the Arctic and Antarctic, the Northern Hemisphere, and alpine regions. The liquid equivalent of snowfall may be evaluated using a snow gauge or with a standard rain gauge, adjusted for winter by removal of a funnel and inner cylinder. Both types of gauges melt the accumulated snow and report the amount of water collected. At some automatic weather stations an ultrasonic snow depth sensor may be used to augment the precipitation gauge.  Snow flurry, snow shower, snow storm and blizzard describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity. A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in different parts of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more: a sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than 0.4 kilometers (0.25 mi). In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria are similar. While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions, falling snow is not a requirement, as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard.Snowstorm intensity may be categorized by visibility and depth of accumulation. Snowfall's intensity is determined by visibility, as follows: 
Light: visibility greater than 1 kilometer (0.6 mi)  Moderate: visibility restrictions between 0.5 and 1 kilometer (0.3 and 0.6 mi) 
Heavy: visibility is less than 0.5 kilometers (0.3 mi)The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground defines "height of new snow" as the depth of freshly fallen snow, in centimeters as measured with a ruler, that accumulated on a snowboard during an observation period of 24 hours, or other observation interval. After the measurement, the snow is cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement at the end of the next interval. Melting, compacting, blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall.  Glaciers with their permanent snowpacks cover about 10% of the earth's surface, while seasonal snow covers about nine percent, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, where seasonal snow covers about 40 million square kilometres (15×10^6 sq mi), according to a 1987 estimate. A 2007 estimate of snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere suggested that, on average, snow cover ranges from a minimum extent of 2 million square kilometres (0.77×10^6 sq mi) each August to a maximum extent of 45 million square kilometres (17×10^6 sq mi) each January or nearly half of the land surface in that hemisphere. A study of Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent for the period 1972–2006 suggests a reduction of 0.5 million square kilometres (0.19×10^6 sq mi) over the 35-year period. 
The following are world records regarding snowfall and snowflakes:  Highest seasonal total snowfall – The world record for the highest seasonal total snowfall was measured in the United States at Mt. Baker Ski Area, outside of the city of Bellingham, Washington during the 1998–1999 season. Mount Baker received 2,896 cm (95.01 ft) of snow, thus surpassing the previous record holder, Mount Rainier, Washington, which during the 1971–1972 season received 2,850 cm (93.5 ft) of snow. 
Highest seasonal average annual snowfall – The world record for the highest average annual snowfall is 1,764 cm (57.87 ft), measured in Sukayu Onsen, Japan for the period of 1981–2010.  Largest snowflake – According to Guinness World Records, the world's largest snowflake fell in January 1887 outside present-day Miles City, Montana. It measured 38 cm (15 in) in diameter. 
After deposition, snow progresses on one of two paths that determine its fate, either ablation (mostly by melting) or transitioning from firn (multi-year snow) into glacier ice. During this transition, snow "is a highly porous, sintered material made up of a continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure". Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as metamorphism, wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space. Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions.  Over the course of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is approximately 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of 500 kilograms per cubic metre (31 lb/cu ft), which is roughly half of the density of liquid water. 
Firn is snow that has persisted for multiple years and has been recrystallized into a substance denser than névé, yet less dense and hard than glacial ice. Firn resembles caked sugar and is very resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from 550 kilograms per cubic metre (34 lb/cu ft) to 830 kilograms per cubic metre (52 lb/cu ft), and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a glacier. The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the firn limit, firn line or snowline.  There are four main mechanisms for movement of deposited snow: drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes, snowmelt during thaw conditions, and the movement of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice. 
When powdery, snow drifts with the wind from the location where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.  An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. They occur in three major mechanisms: 
Slab avalanches occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.  Powder snow avalanches result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of 300 kilometers per hour (190 mph), and masses of 10,000,000 tonnes (9,800,000 long tons; 11,000,000 short tons); their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances. 
Wet snow avalanches are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10 to 40 kilometers per hour (6 to 25 mph)), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.  Many rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow for the rest of the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer. 
Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m (50 ft) of snow-ice.  Scientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the physics of chemical bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike. 
Snow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.  In the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table: 
All are formed in cloud, except for rime, which forms on objects exposed to supercooled moisture.  It also has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature. 
Remote sensing of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery. Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.  Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology—elements of the Earth's water cycle—which help describe global climate change.Global climate change models (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover. The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground defines SWE as "the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely".Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm. 
Snow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.  Snow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for clearing snow, the snowplow. However, the application is different in each case—whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks. 
In the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.The dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction. This can be improved with the use of snow tires, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction. However, the key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti-icing program that employs both chemicals and plowing. The FHWA Manual of Practice for an Effective Anti-icing Program emphasizes "anti-icing" procedures that prevent the bonding of snow and ice to the road. Key aspects of the practice include: understanding anti-icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway, the climatic conditions to be encountered, and the different roles of deicing, anti-icing, and abrasive materials and applications, and employing anti-icing "toolboxes", one for operations, one for decision-making and another for personnel. The elements to the toolboxes are:  Operations – Addresses the application of solid and liquid chemicals, using various techniques, including prewetting of chloride-salts. It also addresses plowing capability, including types of snowplows and blades used. 
Decision-making – Combines weather forecast information with road information to assess the upcoming needs for application of assets and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness with operations underway.  Personnel – Addresses training and deployment of staff to effectively execute the anti-icing program, using the appropriate materials, equipment and procedures.The manual offers matrices that address different types of snow and the rate of snowfall to tailor applications appropriately and efficiently. 
Snow fences, constructed upwind of roadways control snow drifting by causing windblown, drifting snow to accumulate in a desired place. They are also used on railways. Additionally, farmers and ranchers use snow fences to create drifts in basins for a ready supply of water in the spring.  In order to keep airports open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require 6 hectares (15 acres) or more to be cleared.Properly equipped aircraft are able to fly through snowstorms under instrument flight rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise the safety of the aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface. 
Railroads have traditionally employed two types of snow plows for clearing track, the wedge plow, which casts snow to both sides, and the rotary snowplow, which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to one side or the other. Prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca. 1865, it required multiple locomotives to drive a wedge plow through deep snow. Subsequent to clearing the track with such plows, a "flanger" is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow. Where icing may affect the steel-to-steel contact of locomotive wheels on track, abrasives (typically sand) have been used to provide traction on steeper uphills.Railroads employ snow sheds—structures that cover the track—to prevent the accumulation of heavy snow or avalanches to cover tracks in snowy mountainous areas, such as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.  Snowplows for different transportation modes 
Snow can be compacted to form a snow road and be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter. Snow can also be used to provide the supporting structure and surface for a runway, as with the Phoenix Airfield in Antarctica. The snow-compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy-lift military aircraft a year.  Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares). 
Snow is an important consideration for loads on structures. To address these, European countries employ Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-3: General actions - Snow loads. In North America, ASCE Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures gives guidance on snow loads. Both standards employ methods that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs.  Snow loads and icings are two principal issues for roofs. Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it. 
Snow loads – The Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:  Ground snow loads 
Exposure of the roof  Thermal properties of the roof 
Shape of the roof  Drifting 
Importance of the buildingIt gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The Eurocode 1 uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.Icings – Roofs must also be designed to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.  In areas with trees, utility distribution lines on poles are less susceptible to snow loads than they are subject to damage from trees falling on them, felled by heavy, wet snow. Elsewhere, snow can accrete on power lines as "sleeves" of rime ice. Engineers design for such loads, which are measured in kg/m (lb/ft) and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions. Rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions. 
Snow figures into many winter sports and forms of recreation, including skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, e.g. skis and snowboards, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow and contends with the coefficient of friction bearing on snow.  Skiing is by far the largest form of winter recreation. As of 1994, of the estimated 65–75 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in Alpine skiing, the rest engaged in cross-country skiing. Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill skiing was Europe, followed by Japan and the US.Increasingly, ski resorts are relying on snowmaking, the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet-bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.Ski wax enhances the ability of a ski (or other runner) to slide over snow by reducing its coefficient of friction, which depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow. 
Snow affects warfare conducted in winter, alpine environments or at high latitudes. The main factors are impaired visibility for acquiring targets during falling snow, enhanced visibility of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting, and mobility for both mechanized and infantry troops. Snowfall can severely inhibit the logistics of supplying troops, as well. Snow can also provide cover and fortification against small-arms fire. Noted winter warfare campaigns where snow and other factors affected the operations include:  The French invasion of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses made it difficult for supply wagons to keep up with troops. That campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year. 
The Winter War, an attempt by the Soviet Union to take territory in Finland in late 1939 demonstrated superior winter tactics of the Finnish Army, regarding over-snow mobility, camouflage, and use of the terrain.  The Battle of the Bulge, a German counteroffensive during World War II, starting December 16, 1944, was marked by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops, but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis. 
The Korean War which lasted from June 25, 1950, until an armistice on July 27, 1953, began when North Korea invaded South Korea. Much of the fighting occurred during winter conditions, involving snow, notably during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which was a stark example of cold affecting military operations, especially vehicles and weapons.  Military operations in snow 
Both plant and animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.  Snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation. 
Snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many invertebrates thrive in snow, including spiders, wasps, beetles, snow scorpionflys and springtails. Such arthropods are typically active at temperatures down to −5 °C (23 °F). Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce antifreeze agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms fast during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.Small vertebrates are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, alpine salamanders are active in snow at temperatures as low as −8 °C (18 °F); they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than 250 grams (8.8 oz). Omnivores are more likely to enter a torpor or be hibernators, whereas herbivores are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. Voles store up to 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) of food and pikas up to 20 kilograms (44 lb). Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth. On the surface, wolves, coyotes, foxes, lynx, and weasels rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them.  Extraterrestrial "snow" includes water-based precipitation, but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Examples are: 
On Mars, observations of the Phoenix Mars lander reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes. Additionally, carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that planet's ice caps.  On Venus, observations from the Magellan spacecraft reveal the presence a metallic substance, which precipitates as "Venus snow" and leaves a highly reflective substance at the tops of Venus's highest mountain peaks resembling terrestrial snow. Given the high temperatures on Venus, the leading candidates for the precipitate are lead sulfide and bismuth(III) sulfide. 
On Saturn's moon, Titan, Cassini–Huygens spacecraft observations suggest the presence of methane or some other form of hydrocarbon-based crystalline deposits.  United Nations Environment Programme: Global Outlook for Ice and Snow

Alan Mathison Turing (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, so-called chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.  Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England £50 note, which was released to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century. 
Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India. Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney; 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale, London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel. Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years, his parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque. The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.  Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius."Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex). In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school". Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. 
At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.  The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote:I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do. 
Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday. A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.  Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism. Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately. 
After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem. Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December. In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history".  Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus, Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's. It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper. To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. 
From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University, in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to the United Kingdom.  When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes. Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them. 
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker. Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement on the Polish Bomba).  On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS. Like all others who came to Bletchley, he was required to sign the Official Secrets Act, in which he agreed not to disclose anything about his work at Bletchley, with severe legal penalties for violating the Act.Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure dubbed Banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes; developing a procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) cipher machine and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. 
By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions, which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, "who identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted under the Official Secrets Act for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis: [He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted "shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject". ... The papers detailed using "mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible." ... Richard said that GCHQ had now "squeezed the juice" out of the two papers and was "happy for them to be released into the public domain".  Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as "Prof" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the "Prof's Book". According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague: 
In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.  Peter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his "Reminiscences of Bletchley Park" from A Century of Mathematics in America: 
It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement.  Alan Turing was such a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us. 
Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets.While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for meetings, and he was capable of world-class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, but he was hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. When asked why he ran so hard in training he replied:  I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it’s the only way I can get some release. 
Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war. However, official war historian Harry Hinsley estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.At the end of the war, a memo was sent to all those who had worked at Bletchley Park, reminding them that the code of silence dictated by the Official Secrets Act did not end with the war but would continue indefinitely. Thus, even though Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946 by King George VI for his wartime services, his work remained secret for many years.  Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages. 
The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant), the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect." Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth." More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.  Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself". In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.That same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken." For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. 
Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:  The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. 
Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.  During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution: 
There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.  In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. 
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US, Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park. At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.  Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".Although ACE was a feasible design, the effect of the Official Secrets Act surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park made it impossible for Turing to explain the basis of his analysis of how a computer installation involving human operators would work. This led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime. While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz). 
In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death. During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics, and in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.  In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess." The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife, 
Isabel.His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.  When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction–diffusion system, could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis". He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small. Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest." In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism. Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992. 
In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.  In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. 
Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty. The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form, fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out". Murray was given a conditional discharge.Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.  On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew". Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.Philosopher Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons. The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten. Furthermore, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death. He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend. Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability with regard to any suicide claims. 
It has been suggested that Turing's belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood. As a youth, Turing had been told by a fortune-teller that he would be a genius. In mid-May 1954, shortly before his death, Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller during a day-trip to St Annes-on-Sea with the Greenbaum family. According to the Greenbaums' daughter, Barbara:  But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a fortune-teller's tent[,] and Alan said he'd like to go in[,] so we waited around for him to come back... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had happened. We don't know what the fortune-teller said[,] but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide. 
In August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual. The petition received more than 30,000 signatures. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling":  Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better. 
In December 2011, William Jones and his Member of Parliament, John Leech, created an e-petition requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of "gross indecency":  We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of "gross indecency". In 1952, he was convicted of "gross indecency" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called "organo-therapy"—chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save. This remains a shame on the British government and British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws. 
The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures, and was submitted to Parliament by the Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who said:  A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times. 
John Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament and led a high-profile campaign to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was "ultimately just embarrassing" that the conviction still stood. Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years, gaining the public support of numerous leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking. At the British premiere of a film based on Turing's life, The Imitation Game, the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing's pardon. Leech is now regularly described as the "architect" of Turing's pardon and subsequently the Alan Turing Law which went on to secure pardons for 75,000 other men and women convicted of similar crimes.On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952. Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request. The government indicated it would support the bill, and it passed its third reading in the House of Lords in October.At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014, but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons, the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction. The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014. The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War. Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an "Alan Turing law". The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales.  Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.Turing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the A6010 road (the Manchester city intermediate ring road) was named "Alan Turing Way". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the "father of computer science" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the 'u' in 'computer' matches up with the 'u' in 'ADXUO'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine cannot appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain. 
A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture." The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to "the godfather of all modern computers".In 1999, Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and stated, "The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine."A blue plaque was unveiled at King's College on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college's Keynes Building on King's Parade.On 25 March 2021, the Bank of England publicly unveiled the design for a new £50 note, featuring Turing's portrait, before its official issue on 23 June, Turing's birthday. Turing was selected as the new face of the note in 2019 following a public nomination process.  To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the Alan Turing Year in 2012, a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President, worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and Bletchley Park. 
In May 2020 it was reported by Gay Star News that a 12-foot (3.7 m) high steel sculpture, to honour Turing, designed by Sir Antony Gormley, was planned to be installed at King's College, Cambridge. Historic England, however, was quoted as saying that the abstract work of 19 steel slabs "... would be at odds with the existing character of the College. This would result in harm, of a less than substantial nature, to the significance of the listed buildings and landscape, and by extension the conservation area."  Turing, Alan (1950).

Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraïna, pronounced [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest country by area in Europe after Russia, which it borders to the east and north-east. Ukraine also shares borders with Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; Romania and Moldova to the south; and has a coastline along the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. It spans an area of 603,628 km2 (233,062 sq mi). With a population of 43 million, Ukraine is the eighth-most populous country in Europe. The nation's capital and largest city is Kyiv.  The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. During the Middle Ages, the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture, with the loose tribal federation Kievan Rus' forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Reaching its height in the mid-11th century, the Kievan Rus' gradually declined until its collapse from the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Over the next 600 years, the area was contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of powers, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Tsardom of Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries but was ultimately partitioned between Poland and the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, a Ukrainian national movement for self-determination emerged, forming the internationally recognized Ukrainian People's Republic on 23 June 1917. The short-lived state was forcibly reconstituted by the Bolsheviks into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922. Ukraine was the most populous and industrialised republic after the Russian Soviet Republic, until regaining its independence in 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
Following its independence, Ukraine formed a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system, with separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It declared itself a neutral state, forming a limited military partnership with Russia and other CIS countries while also establishing a partnership with NATO in 1994. In 2013, after President Viktor Yanukovych suspended the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement in favor of closer economic ties with Russia, mass protests and demonstrations known as the Euromaidan erupted, escalating into the Revolution of Dignity that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events formed the background for Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the War in Donbas the following month, a protracted conflict with Russian-backed separatists that culminated in a Russian invasion in February 2022. Ukraine has continued seeking closer economic, political, and military ties with the West amid continuing war with Russia.Ukraine is a developing country with a lower-middle income economy, ranking 74th in the Human Development Index. Ukraine is among the poorest countries in Europe. It suffers from low life expectancy and widespread corruption. However, due to its extensive fertile land, Ukraine is one of the largest grain exporters in the world. It is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the GUAM organization, the Association Trio, and the Lublin Triangle.  There are different hypotheses as to the etymological origins of the name of Ukraine. The most widespread hypothesis theorizes that it comes from the old Slavic term for "borderland", as does the word Krajina. 
During most of the 20th century, Ukraine was referred to in the English-speaking world with the definite article as "the Ukraine". This is because the word "ukraina" means "borderland" and translates literally as "the borderlands"; this is similar to "Nederlanden", which means "low lands" and is translated as "the Netherlands". Since Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991, the use of the definite article in the name has become rarer and style guides advise against its use. According to US ambassador William Taylor, "the Ukraine" now implies disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. The official Ukrainian position is that "the Ukraine" is incorrect, both grammatically and politically.  Neanderthal settlement in Ukraine was excavated at the Molodova archaeological sites (43,000–45,000 BC), notable for a dwelling constructed from mammoth bones.Modern human settlement in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the Gravettian culture in the Crimean Mountains. By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic Cucuteni–Trypillia culture was flourishing in wide areas of modern Ukraine, including Trypillia and the entire Dnieper-Dniester region. Ukraine is also considered to be the likely location for the domestication of the horse. During the Iron Age, the land was inhabited by Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. Between 700 BC and 200 BC it was part of the Scythian kingdom.From the 6th century BC, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the Black Sea, such as at Tyras, Olbia, and Chersonesus. These thrived into the 6th century AD. The Goths stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the Huns from the 370s. In the 7th century, the territory that is now eastern Ukraine was the centre of Old Great Bulgaria. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the Khazars took over much of the land.In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Antes people lived in Ukraine. The Antes were the ancestors of Ukrainians: White Croats, Severians, Eastern Polans, Drevlyans, Dulebes, Ulichians, and Tiverians. Migrations from the territories of present-day Ukraine throughout the Balkans established many South Slavic nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to Lake Ilmen, led to the emergence of the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs, the groups ancestral to the Russians. Following an Avar raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium BC. 
The establishment of the Kievan Rus' remains obscure and uncertain; there are at least three versions depending on interpretations of the chronicles. In general, the state included much of present-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. According to the Primary Chronicle the Rus' elite and rulers initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia. In 882, the pagan Prince Oleg (Oleh) conquered Kyiv from Askold and Dir and proclaimed it as the capital of the Rus'. However, it also believed that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper River were already in the process of forming a state independently.During the 10th and 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in Europe. The Varangians later assimilated into the Slavic population and became part of the first Rus' dynasty, the Rurik dynasty. Kievan Rus' was composed of several principalities ruled by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes ("princes"), who often fought each other for possession of Kyiv.The Golden Age of Kievan Rus' began with the reign of Vladimir the Great (980–1015), who turned Rus' toward Byzantine Christianity. During the reign of his son, Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power. The state soon fragmented as the relative importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of Vladimir II Monomakh (1113–1125) and his son Mstislav (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death.  The 13th-century Mongol invasion devastated Kievan Rus' and Kyiv was completely destroyed in 1240. On today's Ukrainian territory, the principalities of Halych and Volodymyr-Volynskyi arose, and were merged into the state of Galicia–Volhynia. Daniel of Galicia, son of Roman the Great, re-united much of south-western Rus', including Volhynia, Galicia and the ancient capital of Kyiv. He was subsequently crowned by the papal archbishop as the first king of the newly-created Kingdom of Ruthenia in 1253. 
Upon the death of Leo II and his brother Andrew the crown of Ruthenia was handed over to their closest living relative, a foreign Polish prince named Bolesław Jerzy, who was crowned Yuri II Boleslav in circa 1323. After his murder in 1340, king Casimir III of Poland laid claim to the kingdom and invaded. Meanwhile, the Principality of Kyiv became the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania following the Battle of Blue Waters (1362–1363). By 1392 the Galicia–Volhynia Wars had ended and Ruthenia ceased to exist as an independent entity, with its lands partitioned between Poland and Lithuania.From the mid-13th century to the late 1400s the Republic of Genoa founded numerous colonies in the Black Sea region of Ukraine, including Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi ("Moncastro") and Kiliya ("Licostomo"); the colonies transformed into large commercial centers headed by the consul, a representative of the Republic. In 1430, Podolia was incorporated into Poland and Ukraine became increasingly settled by Polish colonisers. In 1441, Genghisid prince Haci I Giray founded the Crimean Khanate on the Crimean Peninsula and the surrounding steppes.In 1569 the Union of Lublin established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and most of Ukrainian lands were transferred from Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, thus becoming Polish territory de jure. Under the demographic, cultural and political pressure of Polonisation, many landed gentry of Ruthenia converted to Catholicism and joined the circles of the Polish nobility. Deprived of native protectors among Rus nobility, the peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging Zaporozhian Cossacks, who by the 17th century fiercely defended their traditional Orthodox faith. The Cossacks did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies and occupiers, including the Polish Catholic state with its local representatives.  Formed from Golden Horde territory conquered after the Mongol invasion, the Crimean Khanate was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the 18th century; in 1571 it even captured and devastated Moscow. The borderlands suffered annual Tatar invasions. From the beginning of the 16th century until the end of the 17th century, Crimean Tatar slave raiding bands took about two million slaves from Russia and Ukraine. According to Orest Subtelny, "from 1450 to 1586, eighty-six Tatar raids were recorded, and from 1600 to 1647, seventy." In 1688, Tatars captured a record number of 60,000 Ukrainians. The Tatar raids took a heavy toll, discouraging settlement in more southerly regions where the soil was better and the growing season was longer. The last remnant of the Crimean Khanate was finally conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783.In the mid-17th century, a Cossack military quasi-state, the Zaporozhian Host, was formed by Dnieper Cossacks and by Ruthenian peasants who had fled Polish serfdom. Poland exercised little real control over this population, but found the Cossacks to be a useful opposing force to the Turks and Tatars, and at times the two were allies in military campaigns. However, the continued harsh enserfment of peasantry by Polish nobility and the suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated the Cossacks. The Cossacks sought representation in the Polish Sejm, recognition of Orthodox traditions, and the gradual expansion of the Cossack Registry. These were rejected by the Polish nobility, who dominated the Sejm. 
In 1648, Bohdan Khmelnytsky led the largest of the Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth and the Polish king. After Khmelnytsky made an entry into Kyiv in 1648, where he was hailed liberator of the people from Polish captivity, he founded the Cossack Hetmanate, which existed until 1764 (some sources claim until 1782).Khmelnytsky, deserted by his Tatar allies, suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Berestechko in 1651, and turned to the Russian tsar for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the Pereyaslav Council, forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Russian tsar.  In the period 1657–1686 came "The Ruin", a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, and Cossacks for control of Ukraine, which occurred at about the same time as the Deluge of Poland. The wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths. The "Treaty of Perpetual Peace" between Russia and Poland in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which Poland had claimed sovereignty. 
In 1686, the Metropolitanate of Kyiv was annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate through the Synodal Letter of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Dionysius IV (later anathematized), who made a simony.  In 1709, Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa (1639–1709) defected to Sweden against Russia in the Great Northern War (1700–1721). Eventually Tsar Peter recognized that to consolidate and modernize Russia's political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the Cossack Hetmanate as well as Ukrainian and Cossack aspirations to autonomy. Mazepa died in exile after fleeing from the Battle of Poltava (1709), in which the Swedes and their Cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat. 
The Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, a 1710 constitutional document written by Hetman Pylyp Orlyk, established a standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws. The Constitution limited the executive authority of the hetman, and established a democratically elected Cossack parliament called the General Council.  In 1768, the Cossacks led yet another anti-Polish uprising, called Koliivshchyna, in the Ukrainian borderlands of Poland–Lithuania. Ethnicity was one root cause of this revolt, which included the Massacre of Uman that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews who settled Ukraine in the previous centuries. Religious warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between the Ruthenian Uniate Church and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the Dnieper, in the time of Catherine the Great, set the stage for the uprising. As Uniate religious practices had become more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region became even more dependent on the Russian Orthodox Church. Faith also reflected the opposing Polish (Western Catholic) and Russian (Eastern Orthodox) political allegiances.After the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire in 1783, Novorossiya was settled by Ukrainians and Russians. Despite promises in the Treaty of Pereyaslav, the Ukrainian elite and the Cossacks never received the freedoms and the autonomy they had expected. However, within the Empire, Ukrainians rose to the highest Russian state and church offices. In a later period, tsarists established a policy of Russification, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print and in public. 
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the territory of today's Ukraine was included in the governorates of Chernihiv (Chernigov in Russian), Kharkiv (Kharkov), Kyiv 1708–1764, and Little Russia 1764–1781, Podillia (Podolia), and Volyn (Volhynia)—with all but the first two informally grouped into the Southwestern Krai.  After the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), Catherine the Great and her immediate successors encouraged German immigration into Ukraine and especially into Crimea, to thin the previously dominant Turk population and encourage agriculture. Numerous Ukrainians, Russians, Germans, Bulgarians, Serbs and Greeks moved into the northern Black Sea steppe formerly known as the "Wild Fields".With growing urbanization and modernization, and a cultural trend toward romantic nationalism, a Ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861) and the political theorist Mykhailo Drahomanov (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement.Beginning in the 19th century, there was migration from Ukraine to distant areas of the Russian Empire. According to the 1897 census, there were 223,000 ethnic Ukrainians in Siberia and 102,000 in Central Asia. An additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten years after the opening of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1906. Far Eastern areas with an ethnic Ukrainian population became known as Green Ukraine.Nationalist and socialist parties developed in the late 19th century. Austrian Galicia, under the relatively lenient rule of the Habsburgs, became the centre of the nationalist movement.Ukrainians entered World War I on the side of both the Central Powers, under Austria, and the Triple Entente, under Russia. Three-and-a-half million Ukrainians fought with the Imperial Russian Army, while 250,000 fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Austro-Hungarian authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire. This became the Ukrainian Galician Army that fought against the Bolsheviks and Poles in the post-World War I period (1919–1923). Those suspected of Russophile sentiments in Austria were treated harshly. 
World War I destroyed both empires. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the founding of the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks, and subsequent civil war in Russia. A Ukrainian national movement for self-determination emerged, with Socialist influence. Several Ukrainian states briefly emerged. The internationally recognized Ukrainian People's Republic, the predecessor of modern Ukraine, was declared on 23 June 1917 by the First Universal of the Ukrainian Central Council, proclaimed at first as a part of the Russian Republic. After the October Revolution, the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed on 22 January 1918 by the Fourth Universal of the Ukrainian Central Council. The Hetmanate, the Directorate and the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the West Ukrainian People's Republic and the Hutsul Republic emerged briefly in the Ukrainian lands of former Austro-Hungarian territory.The short-lived Unification Act was an agreement signed on 22 January 1919 by the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic on the St. Sophia Square in Kyiv. This led to civil war, and an anarchist movement called the Black Army (later renamed to the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine) developed in Southern Ukraine under the command of the anarchist Nestor Makhno during the Russian Civil War. They protected the operation of "free soviets" and libertarian communes in the Free Territory, an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society from 1918 to 1921 during the Ukrainian Revolution, fighting both the tsarist White Army under Denikin and later the Red Army under Trotsky, before being defeated by the latter in August 1921.  Poland defeated Western Ukraine in the Polish–Ukrainian War, but failed against the Bolsheviks in an offensive against Kyiv. According to the Peace of Riga, western Ukraine was incorporated into Poland, which in turn recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919. With establishment of the Soviet power, Ukraine lost half of its territory, while Moldavian autonomy was established on the left bank of the Dniester River. Ukraine became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1922. 
The war in Ukraine continued for another two years; by 1921, however, most of Ukraine had been taken over by the Soviet Union, while Galicia and Volhynia (mostly today's West Ukraine) were incorporated into the Second Polish Republic. Modern-day Bukovina was annexed by Romania and Carpathian Ruthenia was admitted to the Czechoslovak Republic as an autonomy.A powerful underground Ukrainian nationalist movement arose in eastern Poland in the 1920s and 1930s, formed by Ukrainian veterans of the Ukrainian-Soviet war (including Yevhen Konovalets, Andriy Melnyk, and Yuriy Tyutyunyk) and was transformed into the Ukrainian Military Organization and later the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). The movement attracted a militant following among students. Hostilities between Polish state authorities and the popular movement led to a substantial number of fatalities, and the autonomy which had been promised was never implemented.The pre-war Polish government also exercised anti-Ukrainian sentiment; it restricted rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality, belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church and inhabited the Eastern Borderlands. The Ukrainian language was restricted in every field possible, especially in governmental institutions, and the term "Ruthenian" was enforced in an attempt to ban the use of the term "Ukrainian". Despite this, a number of Ukrainian parties, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, an active press, and a business sector existed in Poland. Economic conditions improved in the 1920s, but the region suffered from the Great Depression in the early 1930s.  The Russian Civil War devastated the whole Russian Empire including Ukraine. It left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire territory. Soviet Ukraine also faced the Russian famine of 1921 (primarily affecting the Russian Volga-Ural region). During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of Korenisation (literally indigenisation).The Bolsheviks were also committed to universal health care, education and social-security benefits, as well as the right to work and housing. Women's rights were greatly increased through new laws. Most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after Joseph Stalin became the de facto communist party leader.Starting from the late 1920s with a centrally planned economy, Ukraine took part in Soviet industrialisation and the republic's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s. The peasantry suffered from the programme of collectivisation of agriculture, which was part of the first five-year plan and was enforced by regular troops and secret police. Those who resisted were arrested and deported and agricultural productivity greatly declined. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a famine known as the Holodomor or the "Great Famine". 
Scholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of genocide, but the Ukrainian parliament and the governments of other countries have acknowledged it as such. The Communist leadership perceived famine as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms.Largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the Great Terror. These groups were associated with Yefim Yevdokimov (1891–1939) and operated in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration (OGPU) in 1929–1931. Yevdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai. He appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov on security matters; and the latter relied on Yevdokimov's former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations in 1937–1938, known as the Great Terror.In 2010, Kyiv Appellate Court posthumously found Stalin, Kaganovich and other Soviet Communist Party functionaries guilty of genocide against Ukrainians during the Holodomor famine.  Following the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, German and Soviet troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their Ukrainian population became part of Ukraine. For the first time in history, the nation was united.In 1940, the Soviets annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated the northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. But it ceded the western part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. These territorial gains of the USSR were internationally recognized by the Paris peace treaties of 1947. 
German armies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, initiating nearly four years of total war. The Axis initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the Red Army. In the encirclement battle of Kyiv, the city was acclaimed as a "Hero City", because of its fierce resistance. More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the Soviet Western Front) were killed or taken captive there, with many suffering severe mistreatment.Although the majority of Ukrainians fought in or alongside the Red Army and Soviet resistance, in Western Ukraine an independent Ukrainian Insurgent Army movement arose (UPA, 1942). It was created as the armed forces of the underground Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which had developed in interwar Poland as a reactionary nationalist organization. During the interwar period, the Polish government's policies towards the Ukrainian minority were initially very accommodating; however, in the late 1930s they became increasingly harsh due to civil unrest.Both organizations, the OUN and the UPA, supported the goal of an independent Ukrainian state on the territory with a Ukrainian ethnic majority. Although this brought conflict with Nazi Germany, at times the Melnyk wing of the OUN allied with the Nazi forces. From mid-1943 until the end of the war the UPA carried out massacres of ethnic Poles in the Volhynia and Eastern Galicia regions, killing around 100,000 Polish civilians, which brought reprisals.These organized massacres were an attempt by the OUN to create a homogeneous Ukrainian state without a Polish minority living within its borders, and to prevent the post-war Polish state from asserting its sovereignty over areas that had been part of prewar Poland. After the war, the UPA continued to fight the USSR until the 1950s. At the same time, the Ukrainian Liberation Army, another nationalist movement, fought alongside the Nazis.  In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million. The pro-Soviet partisan guerrilla resistance in Ukraine is estimated at 47,800 from the start of occupation to 500,000 at its peak in 1944, with about 50% being ethnic Ukrainians. Generally, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's figures are unreliable, with figures ranging anywhere from 15,000 to as many as 100,000 fighters.Most of the Ukrainian SSR was organised within the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual German settlement. Some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939, hailed the Germans as liberators. Brutal German rule eventually turned their supporters against the Nazi administrators, who made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, carried out genocidal policies against Jews, deported millions of people to work in Germany, and began a depopulation program to prepare for German colonisation. They blockaded the transport of food on the Kyiv River.The vast majority of the fighting in World War II took place on the Eastern Front. By some estimates, 93% of all German casualties took place there. The total losses inflicted upon the Ukrainian population during the war are estimated at 6 million, including an estimated one and a half million Jews killed by the Einsatzgruppen, sometimes with the help of local collaborators. Of the estimated 8.6 million Soviet troop losses, 1.4 million were ethnic Ukrainians. Victory Day is celebrated as one of ten Ukrainian national holidays. The losses of the Ukrainian people in the war amounted to 40–44% of the total losses of the USSR. 
The republic was heavily damaged by the war, and it required significant efforts to recover. More than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages were destroyed. The situation was worsened by a famine in 1946–1947, which was caused by a drought and the wartime destruction of infrastructure. The death toll of this famine varies, with even the lowest estimate in the tens of thousands. In 1945, the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the United Nations organization, part of a special agreement at the Yalta Conference.Post-war ethnic cleansing occurred in the newly expanded Soviet Union. As of 1 January 1953, Ukrainians were second only to Russians among adult "special deportees", comprising 20% of the total. In addition, over 450,000 ethnic Germans from Ukraine and more than 200,000 Crimean Tatars were victims of forced deportations.  Following the death of Stalin in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the new leader of the USSR. Having served as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukrainian SSR in 1938–1949, Khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic; after taking power union-wide, he began to emphasize "the friendship" between the Ukrainian and Russian nations. In 1954, the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav was widely celebrated. Crimea was transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR.By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production. Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production, and an important centre of the Soviet arms industry and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably Leonid Brezhnev. He later ousted Khrushchev and became the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982. 
On 26 April 1986, a reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, resulting in the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history. At the time of the accident, 7 million people lived in the contaminated territories, including 2.2 million in Ukraine.After the accident, the new city of Slavutych was built outside the exclusion zone to house and support the employees of the plant, which was decommissioned in 2000. A report prepared by the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Health Organization attributed 56 direct deaths to the accident and estimated that there may have been 4,000 extra cancer deaths.  On 21 January 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians organised a human chain for Ukrainian independence between Kyiv and Lviv, in memory of the 1919 unification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian National Republic. Citizens came out to the streets and highways, forming live chains by holding hands in support of unity. 
On 16 July 1990, the new parliament adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. This established the principles of the self-determination, democracy, independence, and the priority of Ukrainian law over Soviet law. A month earlier, a similar declaration was adopted by the parliament of the Russian SFSR. This started a period of confrontation with the central Soviet authorities. On 2–17 October 1990, the Revolution on Granite took place in Ukraine, the main purpose of the action was to prevent the signing of a new union treaty of the USSR. The demands of the students were satisfied by signing a resolution of the Verkhovna Rada, which guaranteed their implementation.  In August 1991, a faction among the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union attempted a coup to remove Mikhail Gorbachev and to restore the Communist party's power. After it failed, on 24 August 1991 the Ukrainian parliament adopted the Act of Independence. 
A referendum and the first presidential elections took place on 1 December 1991. More than 92% of the electorate expressed their support for the Act of Independence, and they elected the chairman of the parliament, Leonid Kravchuk, as the first president of Ukraine. At the meeting in Brest, Belarus on 8 December, followed by the Alma Ata meeting on 21 December, the leaders of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine formally dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On 26 December 1991 the Council of Republics of the USSR Supreme Council adopted the declaration "In regards to creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States" which de jure dissolved the Soviet Union and the Soviet flag was lowered over the Kremlin. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine did not ratify the accession, so Ukraine has never been a member of the CIS.Ukraine was initially viewed as having favourable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union. However, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than some of the other former Soviet Republics. During the recession, Ukraine lost 60% of its GDP from 1991 to 1999, and suffered five-digit inflation rates. Dissatisfied with the economic conditions, as well as the amounts of crime and corruption in Ukraine, Ukrainians protested and organized strikes.The Ukrainian economy stabilized by the end of the 1990s. A new currency, the hryvnia, was introduced in 1996. After 2000, the country enjoyed steady real economic growth averaging about seven percent annually. A new Constitution of Ukraine, under the second President Leonid Kuchma in 1996, turned Ukraine into a semi-presidential republic and established a stable political system. Kuchma was, however, criticised by opponents for corruption, electoral fraud, discouraging free speech and concentrating too much power in his office. Ukraine also pursued full nuclear disarmament, giving up the third largest nuclear weapons stockpile in the world and dismantling or removing all strategic bombers on its territory in exchange for various assurances (main article: Nuclear weapons and Ukraine).  In 2004, Viktor Yanukovych, then prime minister, was declared the winner of the presidential elections, which the Supreme Court of Ukraine later ruled had been largely rigged . The results caused a public outcry in support of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, who challenged the outcome. During the tumultuous months of the revolution, candidate Yushchenko suddenly became gravely ill, and was soon found by multiple independent physician groups to have been poisoned by TCDD dioxin. Yushchenko strongly suspected Russian involvement in his poisoning. All of this eventually resulted in the peaceful Orange Revolution, which brought Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko to power, while casting Yanukovych in opposition.Yanukovych returned to power in 2006 as prime minister in the Alliance of National Unity, until snap elections in September 2007 made Tymoshenko prime minister again. Amid the 2008–09 Ukrainian financial crisis the Ukrainian economy shrank by 15%. Disputes with Russia briefly stopped all gas supplies to Ukraine in 2006 and again in 2009, leading to gas shortages in other countries. Yanukovych was elected President in 2010 with 48% of the vote. 
The Euromaidan (Ukrainian: Євромайдан, literally "Eurosquare") protests started in November 2013 after the president, Viktor Yanukovych, began moving away from an association agreement that had been in the works with the European Union and instead chose to establish closer ties with the Russian Federation. Some Ukrainians took to the streets to show their support for closer ties with Europe.Meanwhile, in the predominantly Russian-speaking east, a large portion of the population opposed the Euromaidan protests, instead supporting the Yanukovych government. Over time, Euromaidan came to describe a wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine, the scope of which evolved to include calls for the resignation of President Yanukovych and his government.Violence escalated after 16 January 2014 when the government accepted new Anti-Protest Laws. Violent anti-government demonstrators occupied buildings in the centre of Kyiv, including the Justice Ministry building, and riots from 18 to 20 February left 98 dead, with approximately fifteen thousand injured and 100 missing. On 21 February, President Yanukovych signed a compromise deal with opposition leaders that promised constitutional changes to restore certain powers to Parliament and called for early elections to be held by December.However, Members of Parliament voted on 22 February to remove the president and set an election for 25 May to select his replacement, a move described by Russia and US academic John Mearsheimer as a coup. The ousting of Yanukovych prompted Vladimir Putin to begin preparations to annex Crimea on 23 February 2014. Petro Poroshenko, running on a pro-European Union platform, won with over fifty percent of the vote, therefore not requiring a run-off election. Upon his election, Poroshenko announced that his immediate priorities would be to take action on the civil unrest in Eastern Ukraine and mend ties with the Russian Federation. In October 2014 Parliament elections, Petro Poroshenko Bloc "Solidarity" won 132 of the 423 contested seats.  Using the Russian naval base at Sevastopol as cover, Putin directed Russian troops and intelligence agents to disarm Ukrainian forces and take control of Crimea. After the troops entered Crimea, a controversial referendum was held on 16 March 2014 and the official result was that 97 percent wished to join with Russia.On 18 March 2014, Russia and the self-proclaimed Republic of Crimea signed a treaty of accession of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in the Russian Federation. The UN General Assembly immediately responded by passing resolution 68/262 declaring that the referendum was invalid and supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine; only Russia voted against the resolution. However, it was not enforceable. Attempts to pass enforceable resolutions in the U.N. Security Council were blocked by Russian vetoes.Separately, in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, armed men declaring themselves as local militia and supported by pro-Russian protesters seized government buildings, police and special police stations in several cities and held unrecognised status referendums. The insurgency was led by Russian emissaries Igor Girkin and Alexander Borodai as well as militants from Russia, such as Arseny Pavlov. They proclaimed the self styled Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic which have controlled about 1/3 of the oblasts since then.Talks in Geneva between the EU, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States yielded a Joint Diplomatic Statement referred to as the 2014 Geneva Pact in which the parties requested that all unlawful militias lay down their arms and vacate seized government buildings, and also establish a political dialogue that could lead to more autonomy for Ukraine's regions. When Petro Poroshenko won the presidential election held on 25 May 2014, he vowed to continue the military operations by the Ukrainian government forces to end the armed insurgency.In August 2014, a bilateral commission of leading scholars from the United States and Russia issued the Boisto Agenda outlining a 24-step plan to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. The Boisto Agenda was organized into five imperative categories for addressing the crisis requiring stabilization identified as: (1) Elements of an Enduring, Verifiable Ceasefire; (2) Economic Relations; (3) Social and Cultural Issues; (4) Crimea; and, (5) International Status of Ukraine. In late 2014, Ukraine ratified the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement, which Poroshenko described as Ukraine's "first but most decisive step" towards EU membership. Poroshenko also set 2020 as the target for EU membership application. 
In February 2015, after a summit hosted in Minsk, Belarus, Poroshenko negotiated a ceasefire with the separatist troops. The resulting agreements, known as the Minsk Protocol, included conditions such as the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the front line and decentralisation of rebel regions by the end of 2015. They also included conditions such as Ukrainian control of the border with Russia in 2015 and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Ukrainian territory. The ceasefire began on 15 February 2015. Participants in this ceasefire also agreed to attend regular meetings to ensure that the agreement was respected.On 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European Union, which aims to modernize and develop Ukraine's economy, governance and rule of law to EU standards and gradually increase integration with the EU Internal market. In 2017 the European Union approved visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens: entitling Ukrainians to travel to the Schengen area for tourism, family visits and business reasons, with the only document required being a valid biometric passport.  In spring 2021, Russia began building up troop strengths along its border with Ukraine. On 22 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military forces to enter the breakaway Ukrainian republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, calling the act a "peacekeeping mission". Putin also officially recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as sovereign states, fully independent from the Ukrainian government.In the early hours of 24 February 2022, Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarize and de-Nazify" Ukraine, and launched a large-scale invasion of the country. Later in the day, the Ukrainian government announced that Russia had taken control of Chernobyl.Ukraine asked for immediate admission to the European Union on 28 February 2022 in response to the invasion. 
Ukraine is the second-largest European country, after Russia. Lying between latitudes 44° and 53° N, and longitudes 22° and 41° E., it is mostly in the East European Plain. Ukraine covers an area of 603,628 square kilometres (233,062 sq mi), with a coastline of 2,782 kilometres (1,729 mi).The landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or steppes) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the Dnieper (Dnipro), Seversky Donets, Dniester and the Southern Bug as they flow south into the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov. To the southwest, the delta of the Danube forms the border with Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the Carpathian Mountains in the west, of which the highest is Hoverla at 2,061 metres (6,762 ft), and the Crimean Mountains, in the extreme south along the coast.Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper). To the east there are the south-western spurs of the Central Russian Upland over which runs the border with the Russian Federation. Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The snow melt from the mountains feeds the rivers and their waterfalls.  Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air and water pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. 
Ukraine has a mostly continental climate, with the exception of the southern coast of Crimea which has a subtropical climate.  The climate is influenced by moderately warm, humid air coming from the Atlantic Ocean. Average annual temperatures range from 5.5–7 °C (42–45 °F) in the north, to 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) in the south.Precipitation is highest in the west and north and lowest in the east and southeast. Western Ukraine, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains, receives around 1,200 millimetres (47.2 in) of precipitation annually, while Crimea and the coastal areas of the Black Sea receive around 400 millimetres (15.7 in). 
Ukraine contains six terrestrial ecoregions: Central European mixed forests, Crimean Submediterranean forest complex, East European forest steppe, Pannonian mixed forests, Carpathian montane conifer forests, and Pontic steppe. Ukraine is home to a diverse assemblage of animals, fungi, microorganisms and plants.  Ukraine falls into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested areas of the country, it is not uncommon to find lynxes, wolves, wild boars and martens. 
This is especially true of the Carpathian Mountains, where many predatory mammals make their home, such as brown bears. Around Ukraine's lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst in the waters carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.  More than 6,600 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) have been recorded from Ukraine, but this number is far from complete. The true total of fungal species occurring in Ukraine, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered. Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Ukraine, and 2,217 such species have been tentatively identified. 
Ukraine is a republic under a mixed semi-parliamentary semi-presidential system with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches.  The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is the formal head of state. 
Ukraine's legislative branch includes the 450-seat unicameral parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. The parliament is primarily responsible for the formation of the executive branch and the Cabinet of Ministers, headed by the prime minister. The president retains the authority to nominate the ministers of foreign affairs and of defence for parliamentary approval, as well as the power to appoint the prosecutor general and the head of the Security Service.Laws, acts of the parliament and the cabinet, presidential decrees, and acts of the Crimean parliament may be abrogated by the Constitutional Court, should they be found to violate the constitution. Other normative acts are subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction.  Local self-government is officially guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the president in accordance with the proposals of the prime minister. 
The courts enjoy legal, financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by Ukrainian law since 2002. Judges are largely well protected from dismissal (except in the instance of gross misconduct). Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years, after which Ukraine's Supreme Council confirms their positions for life. Although there are still problems, the system is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine's independence in 1991. The Supreme Court is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government. The World Justice Project ranks Ukraine 66 out of 99 countries surveyed in its annual Rule of Law Index.Prosecutors in Ukraine have greater powers than in most European countries, and according to the European Commission for Democracy through Law 'the role and functions of the Prosecutor's Office is not in accordance with Council of Europe standards". The criminal judicial system maintains an average conviction rate of over 99%, equal to the conviction rate of the Soviet Union, with suspects often being incarcerated for long periods before trial.On 24 March 2010, President Yanukovych formed an expert group to make recommendations how to "clean up the current mess and adopt a law on court organization". One day later, he stated "We can no longer disgrace our country with such a court system." The criminal judicial system and the prison system of Ukraine remain quite punitive.  Since 1 January 2010 it has been permissible to hold court proceedings in Russian by mutual consent of the parties. Citizens unable to speak Ukrainian or Russian may use their native language or the services of a translator. Previously all court proceedings had to be held in Ukrainian. 
Law enforcement agencies in Ukraine are organised under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They consist primarily of the national police force and various specialised units and agencies such as the State Border Guard and the Coast Guard services. Law enforcement agencies, particularly the police, faced criticism for their heavy handling of the 2004 Orange Revolution. Many thousands of police officers were stationed throughout the capital, primarily to dissuade protesters from challenging the state's authority but also to provide a quick reaction force in case of need; most officers were armed. Bloodshed was only avoided when Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov heeded his colleagues' calls to withdraw.The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also responsible for the maintenance of the State Security Service; Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, which has on occasion been accused of acting like a secret police force serving to protect the country's political elite from media criticism. On the other hand, however, it is widely accepted that members of the service provided vital information about government plans to the leaders of the Orange Revolution to prevent the collapse of the movement.  From 1999 to 2001, Ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. Historically, Soviet Ukraine joined the United Nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a Western compromise with the Soviet Union, which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics. Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia. Ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to UN peacekeeping operations since 1992. 
Ukraine considers Euro-Atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective, but in practice it has always balanced its relationship with the European Union and the United States with strong ties to Russia. The European Union's Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine went into force in 1998. The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in Helsinki, recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association.In 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)), and also became a member of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Ukraine–NATO relations are close and the country has declared interest in eventual membership.Ukraine is the most active member of the Partnership for Peace (PfP). All major political parties in Ukraine support full eventual integration into the European Union. The Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union was signed in 2014.  Ukraine long had close ties with all its neighbours, but Russia–Ukraine relations rapidly deteriorated in 2014 by the annexation of Crimea, energy dependence and payment disputes. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which entered into force in January 2016 following the ratification of the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement, formally integrates Ukraine into the European Single Market and the European Economic Area. Ukraine receives further support and assistance for its EU-accession aspirations from the International Visegrád Fund of the Visegrád Group that consists of Central European EU members the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.In 2020, in Lublin, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine created the Lublin Triangle initiative, which aims to create further cooperation between the three historical countries of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and further Ukraine's integration and accession to the EU and NATO.In 2021, the Association Trio was formed by signing a joint memorandum between the Foreign Ministers of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Association Trio is tripartite format for the enhanced cooperation, coordination, and dialogue between the three countries (that have signed the Association Agreement with the EU) with the European Union on issues of common interest related to European integration, enhancing cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership, and committing to the prospect of joining the European Union. As of 2021, Ukraine was preparing to formally apply for EU membership in 2024, in order to join the European Union in the 2030s, however, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy requested that the country be admitted to the EU immediately. 
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited a 780,000-man military force on its territory, equipped with the third-largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world. In May 1992, Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons to Russia for disposal and to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state. Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons. It signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000). The country plans to convert the current conscript-based military into a professional volunteer military.  Ukraine has been playing an increasingly larger role in peacekeeping operations. On Friday 3 January 2014, the Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sagaidachniy joined the European Union's counter piracy Operation Atalanta and will be part of the EU Naval Force off the coast of Somalia for two months. Ukrainian troops are deployed in Kosovo as part of the Ukrainian-Polish Battalion.A Ukrainian unit was deployed in Lebanon, as part of UN Interim Force enforcing the mandated ceasefire agreement. There was also a maintenance and training battalion deployed in Sierra Leone. In 2003–05, a Ukrainian unit was deployed as part of the Multinational force in Iraq under Polish command. The total Ukrainian armed forces deployment around the world is 562 servicemen.Military units of other states participate in multinational military exercises with Ukrainian forces in Ukraine regularly, including U.S. military forces.Following independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state. The country has had a limited military partnership with Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994. In the 2000s, the government was leaning towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002. It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum at some point in the future. Recently deposed President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient, and was against Ukraine joining NATO. During the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO declared that Ukraine would eventually become a member of NATO when it meets the criteria for the accession. 
The system of Ukrainian subdivisions reflects the country's status as a unitary state (as stated in the country's constitution) with unified legal and administrative regimes for each unit.  Including Sevastopol and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea that were annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014, Ukraine consists of 27 regions: twenty-four oblasts (provinces), one autonomous republic (Autonomous Republic of Crimea), and two cities of special status—Kyiv, the capital, and Sevastopol. The 24 oblasts and Crimea are subdivided into 136 raions (districts) and city municipalities of regional significance, or second-level administrative units. 
Populated places in Ukraine are split into two categories: urban and rural. Urban populated places are split further into cities and urban-type settlements (a Soviet administrative invention), while rural populated places consist of villages and settlements (a generally used term). All cities have certain degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance (as in the case of Kyiv and Sevastopol), regional significance (within each oblast or autonomous republic) or district significance (all the rest of cities). A city's significance depends on several factors such as its population, socio-economic and historical importance, infrastructure and others.  Ukraine has a lower-middle income economy, which is the 55th largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the 40th largest by PPP. It is one of the world's largest grain exporters. However, Ukraine remains among the poorest in Europe and most severely corrupt countries in the continent. According to the IMF, Ukraine's GDP per capita by PPP is $14,146.In 2021, the average nominal salary in Ukraine reached its highest level at ₴14,282 (or $525) per month. In 2018, Ukraine's median wealth per adult was $40, one of the lowest in the world. Approximately 1.1% of Ukrainians lived below the national poverty line in 2019. Unemployment in Ukraine was 4.5% in 2019. In 2019 5–15% of the Ukrainian population were categorized as middle class. As of September 2020, Ukraine's government debt is roughly 52% of its nominal GDP.Ukraine produces nearly all types of transportation vehicles and spacecraft. Antonov airplanes and KrAZ trucks are exported to many countries. The majority of Ukrainian exports are marketed to the European Union and CIS. Since independence, Ukraine has maintained its own space agency, the State Space Agency of Ukraine (SSAU). Ukraine became an active participant in scientific space exploration and remote sensing missions. Between 1991 and 2007, Ukraine has launched six self made satellites and 101 launch vehicles, and continues to design spacecraft.Ukraine produces and processes its own natural gas and petroleum. However, the country imports most of its energy supplies, and 80% of Ukraine's natural gas supplies are imported, mainly from Russia. 
Ukraine has a very large heavy-industry base and is one of the largest refiners of metallurgical products in Eastern Europe. The country's largest and most competitive firms are components of the PFTS index, traded on the PFTS Ukraine Stock Exchange.  Well-known Ukrainian brands include Naftogaz Ukrainy, AvtoZAZ, PrivatBank, Roshen, Yuzhmash, Nemiroff, Motor Sich, Khortytsia, Kyivstar and Aerosvit. 
Before the Russo-Ukrainian War Ukraine occupied 8th place in Europe by the number of tourists visiting, according to the World Tourism Organization rankings. Ukraine has numerous tourist attractions: mountain ranges suitable for skiing, hiking and fishing: the Black Sea coastline as a popular summer destination; nature reserves of different ecosystems; churches, castle ruins and other architectural and park landmarks; various outdoor activity points. Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa and Kamyanets-Podilskyi were Ukraine's principal tourist centres each offering many historical landmarks as well as formidable hospitality infrastructure. Tourism used to be the mainstay of Crimea's economy, but there was a major fall in visitor numbers following the Russian annexation in 2014.The Seven Wonders of Ukraine and Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine are the selection of the most important landmarks of Ukraine, chosen by the general public through an Internet-based vote.  Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the country had over 41 million people, and was the eighth-most populous country in Europe. It is a heavily urbanized country, and its industrial regions in the east and southeast are the most densely populated—about 67% of its total population lives in urban areas. At that time Ukraine had a population density of 69.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (180 per square mile), and the overall life expectancy in the country at birth was 73 years (68 years for males and 77.8 years for females).Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's population hit a peak of roughly 52 million in 1993. However, due to its death rate exceeding its birth rate, mass emigration, poor living conditions, and low-quality health care, the total population decreased by 6.6 million, or 12.8% from the same year to 2014. 
According to the 2001 census, ethnic Ukrainians made up roughly 78% of the population, while Russians were the largest minority, at some 17.3% of the population. Small minority populations included: Belarusians (0.6%), Moldovans (0.5%), Crimean Tatars (0.5%), Bulgarians (0.4%), Hungarians (0.3%), Romanians (0.3%), Poles (0.3%), Jews (0.3%), Armenians (0.2%), Greeks (0.2%) and Tatars (0.2%). It was also estimated that there were about 10–40,000 Koreans in Ukraine, who lived mostly in the south of the country, belonging to the historical Koryo-saram group.In the late 2010s 1.4 million Ukrainians were internally displaced due to the war in Donbas, and in early 2022 over a million fled the country because of the Russo-Ukrainian war.  According to the constitution, the state language of Ukraine is Ukrainian. Russian is widely spoken, especially in eastern and southern Ukraine. According to the 2001 census, 67.5 percent of the population declared Ukrainian as their native language and 29.6 percent declared Russian. Most native Ukrainian speakers know Russian as a second language. Russian was the de facto dominant language of the Soviet Union but Ukrainian also held official status and in the schools of the Ukrainian SSR learning Ukrainian was mandatory.Effective in August 2012, a new law on regional languages entitles any local language spoken by at least a 10 percent minority be declared official within that area. Russian was within weeks declared as a regional language in several southern and eastern oblasts (provinces) and cities. Russian can now be used in these cities'/oblasts' administrative office work and documents.On 23 February 2014, following the Revolution of Dignity, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to repeal the law on regional languages, making Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels; however, the repeal was not signed by acting President Turchynov or by President Poroshenko. In February 2019, the law allowing for official use of regional languages was found unconstitutional.Ukrainian is mainly spoken in western and central Ukraine. In western Ukraine, Ukrainian is also the dominant language in cities (such as Lviv). In central Ukraine, Ukrainian and Russian are both equally used in cities, with Russian being more common in Kyiv, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russian is primarily used in cities, and Ukrainian is used in rural areas. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people. Hungarian is spoken in the Zakarpattia Oblast.For a large part of the Soviet era, the number of Ukrainian speakers declined from generation to generation, and by the mid-1980s, the usage of the Ukrainian language in public life had decreased significantly. Following independence, the government of Ukraine began restoring the image and usage of Ukrainian language through a policy of Ukrainisation. Today, most foreign films and TV programs, including Russian ones, are subtitled or dubbed in Ukrainian. Ukraine's 2017 education law bars primary education in public schools in grade five and up in any language but Ukrainian. The Unian reported that "A ban on the use of cultural products, namely movies, books, songs, etc., in the Russian language in the public has been introduced" in the Lviv Oblast in September 2018.According to the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Ukrainian is the only state language of the republic. However, the republic's constitution specifically recognises Russian as the language of the majority of its population and guarantees its usage 'in all spheres of public life'. Similarly, the Crimean Tatar language (the language of 12 percent of population of Crimea) is guaranteed a special state protection as well as the 'languages of other ethnicities'. Russian speakers constitute an overwhelming majority of the Crimean population (77 percent), with Crimean Tatar speakers 11.4 percent and Ukrainian speakers comprising just 10.1 percent. But in everyday life the majority of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea use Russian. 
Ukraine has the world's second-largest Eastern Orthodox population, after Russia. A 2021 survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found that 82% of Ukrainians declared themselves to be religious, while 7% were atheists, and a further 11% found it difficult to answer the question. The level of religiosity in Ukraine was reported to be the highest in Western Ukraine (91%), and the lowest in the Donbas (57%) and Eastern Ukraine (56%).In 2019, 82% of Ukrainians were Christians; out of which 72.7% declared themselves to be Orthodox, 8.8% Greek Rite Catholics, 2.3% Protestants and 0.9% Latin Rite Catholics. 2.3% other Christians. Judaism, Islam and Hinduism were the religions of 0.2% of the population each. According to the KIIS study, roughly 58.3% of the Ukrainian Orthodox population were members of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, and 25.4% were members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.According to a 2018 survey by the Razumkov Centre, 9.4% of Ukrainians were Byzantine Rite Catholics and 0.8% were Latin Rite Catholics. Protestants are a growing community in Ukraine, who made up 1.9% of the population in 2016, but rose to 2.2% of the population in 2018.  Ukraine's healthcare system is state subsidised and freely available to all Ukrainian citizens and registered residents. However, it is not compulsory to be treated in a state-run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide. The public sector employs most healthcare professionals, with those working for private medical centres typically also retaining their state employment as they are mandated to provide care at public health facilities on a regular basis. 
All of Ukraine's medical service providers and hospitals are subordinate to the Ministry of Healthcare, which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day-to-day administration of the healthcare system. Despite this, standards of hygiene and patient-care have fallen.Hospitals in Ukraine are organised along the same lines as most European nations, according to the regional administrative structure; as a result most towns have their own hospital (Міська Лікарня) and many also have district hospitals (Районна Лікарня). Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, Kyiv. However, all oblasts have their own network of general hospitals which are able to deal with almost all medical problems and are typically equipped with major trauma centres; such hospitals are called 'regional hospitals' (Обласна Лікарня).  Ukraine faces a number of major public health issues and is considered to be in a demographic crisis because of its high death rate and low birth rate (the Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population). A factor contributing to the high death rate is a high mortality rate among working-age males from preventable causes such as alcohol poisoning and smoking. In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at −5% growth. The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve. In addition, obesity, systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the Ukrainian healthcare system. 
As of March 2009 the Ukrainian government is reforming the health care system, by the creation of a national network of family doctors and improvements in the medical emergency services. In November 2009, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko proposed introducing a public healthcare system based on health insurance in the spring of 2010.Active reformation of Ukraine's healthcare system was initiated right after the appointment of Ulana Suprun as a head of the Ministry of Healthcare. Assisted by deputy Pavlo Kovtoniuk, Suprun first changed the distribution of finances in healthcare. Funds must follow the patient. General practitioners will provide basic care for patients. The patient will have the right to choose one. Emergency medical service is considered to be fully funded by the state. Emergency Medicine Reform is also an important part of the healthcare reform. In addition, patients who suffer from chronic diseases, which cause a high toll of disability and mortality, are provided with free or low-price medicine.The Ukrainian Red Cross Society was established in April 1918 in Kyiv as an independent humanitarian society of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Its immediate tasks were to help refugees and prisoners of war, care for handicapped people and orphaned children, fight famine and epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, hospitals and public canteens. At present, society involves more than 6.3 million supporters and activists. Its Visiting Nurses Service has 3,200 qualified nurses.  The organization takes part in more than 40 humanitarian programmes all over Ukraine, which are mostly funded by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimates, the Society annually provides services to more than 105,000 lonely, elderly people, about 23,000 people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped workers, more than 25,000 war veterans, and more than 8,000 adults handicapped since childhood. Assistance for orphaned and disabled children is also rendered. 
According to the Ukrainian constitution, access to free education is granted to all citizens. Complete general secondary education is compulsory in the state schools which constitute the overwhelming majority. Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis. There is also a small number of accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.  Because of the Soviet Union's emphasis on total access of education for all citizens, which continues today, the literacy rate is an estimated 99.4%. Since 2005, an eleven-year school programme has been replaced with a twelve-year one: primary education takes four years to complete (starting at age six), middle education (secondary) takes five years to complete; upper secondary then takes three years. Students in the 12th grade take Government tests, which are also referred to as school-leaving exams. These tests are later used for university admissions. 
The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the Ostrozka School, or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of Ostrog, the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the Eastern Slavic territories. The oldest university was the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of Imperial Russia as a higher education institution.  Among the oldest is also the Lviv University, founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in Kharkiv (1805), Kyiv (1834), Odessa (1865) and Chernivtsi (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a Technological Institute (1885) in Kharkiv, a Polytechnic Institute in Kyiv (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in Katerynoslav. Rapid growth followed in the Soviet period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students. Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations. 
The Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments, scientific and methodological facilities under national, municipal and self-governing bodies in charge of education. The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world's higher developed countries, as is defined by UNESCO and the UN.  Ukraine has more than 800 higher-education institutions and in 2010 the number of graduates reached 654,700 people.Ukraine produces the fourth largest number of post-secondary graduates in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. Higher education is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. 
Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. It is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4 years) and the master's degree (5–6th year), in accordance with the Bologna process. Historically, Specialist degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.  The Law of Ukraine On Higher Education came into force on 6 September 2014. It was approved in Ukrainian Parliament on 1 July 2014. The main changes in the system of higher education: a separate collegiate body to monitor the quality of education was established (Ukrainian: Національне агентство із забезпечення якості вищої освіти); each higher education institution has the right to implement its own educational and research programs; role of the student government was increased; higher education institution has the right to freely administer own revenues; five following types of higher education qualifications were established: Junior Bachelor, Bachelor, Master, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Doctor of Science; load on lecturers and students was reduced; academic mobility for faculty and students etc. 
Ukrainian is the dominant language in Western Ukraine and in Central Ukraine, while Russian is the dominant language in the cities of Eastern Ukraine and Southern Ukraine. In the Ukrainian SSR schools, learning Russian was mandatory; in modern Ukraine, schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction offer classes in Russian and in the other minority languages.On the Russian language, on Soviet Union and Ukrainian nationalism, opinion in Eastern Ukraine and Southern Ukraine tends to be the exact opposite of those in Western Ukraine; while opinions in Central Ukraine on these topics tend be less extreme.Similar historical cleavages also remain evident at the level of individual social identification. Attitudes toward the most important political issue, relations with Russia, differed strongly between Lviv, identifying more with Ukrainian nationalism and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and Donetsk, predominantly Russian orientated and favourable to the Soviet era, while in central and southern Ukraine, as well as Kyiv, such divisions were less important and there was less antipathy toward people from other regions (a poll by the Research & Branding Group held March 2010 showed that the attitude of the citizens of Donetsk to the citizens of Lviv was 79% positive and that the attitude of the citizens of Lviv to the citizens of Donetsk was 88% positive).However, all were united by an overarching Ukrainian identity based on shared economic difficulties, showing that other attitudes are determined more by culture and politics than by demographic differences. Surveys of regional identities in Ukraine have shown that the feeling of belonging to a "Soviet identity" is strongest in the Donbas (about 40%) and the Crimea (about 30%).During elections voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts (provinces) vote mostly for parties (Our Ukraine, Batkivshchyna) and presidential candidates (Viktor Yuschenko, Yulia Tymoshenko) with a pro-Western and state reform platform, while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts vote for parties (CPU, Party of Regions) and presidential candidates (Viktor Yanukovych) with a pro-Russian and status quo platform. However, this geographical division is decreasing.  In total, Ukraine has 457 cities, 176 of them are labelled oblast-class, 279 smaller raion-class cities, and two special legal status cities. These are followed by 886 urban-type settlements and 28,552 villages. 
Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by Orthodox Christianity, the dominant religion in the country. Gender roles also tend to be more traditional, and grandparents play a greater role in bringing up children, than in the West. The culture of Ukraine has also been influenced by its eastern and western neighbours, reflected in its architecture, music and art.The Communist era had quite a strong effect on the art and writing of Ukraine. In 1932, Stalin made socialist realism state policy in the Soviet Union when he promulgated the decree "On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organisations". This greatly stifled creativity. During the 1980s glasnost (openness) was introduced and Soviet artists and writers again became free to express themselves as they wanted.The tradition of the Easter egg, known as pysanky, has long roots in Ukraine. These eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern; then, the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours, the dye did not affect the previously wax-coated parts of the egg. After the entire egg was dyed, the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern. This tradition is thousands of years old, and precedes the arrival of Christianity to Ukraine. In the city of Kolomyia near the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, the museum of Pysanka was built in 2000 and won a nomination as the monument of modern Ukraine in 2007, part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine action.  Artisan textile arts play an important role in Ukrainian culture, especially in Ukrainian wedding traditions. Ukrainian embroidery, weaving and lace-making are used in traditional folk dress and in traditional celebrations. Ukrainian embroidery varies depending on the region of origin and the designs have a long history of motifs, compositions, choice of colours and types of stitches. Use of colour is very important and has roots in Ukrainian folklore. Embroidery motifs found in different parts of Ukraine are preserved in the Rushnyk Museum in Pereiaslav. 
National dress is woven and highly decorated. Weaving with handmade looms is still practised in the village of Krupove, situated in Rivne Oblast. The village is the birthplace of two famous personalities in the scene of national crafts fabrication. Nina Myhailivna and Uliana Petrivna with international recognition.  The history of Ukrainian literature dates back to the 11th century, following the Christianisation of Kievan Rus'. The writings of the time were mainly liturgical and were written in Old Church Slavonic. Historical accounts of the time were referred to as chronicles, the most significant of which was the Primary Chronicle. Literary activity faced a sudden decline during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. 
Ukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th century, and was advanced significantly in the 16th century with the introduction of print and with the beginning of the Cossack era, under both Russian and Polish dominance. The Cossacks established an independent society and popularized a new kind of epic poems, which marked a high point of Ukrainian oral literature. These advances were then set back in the 17th and early 18th centuries, when publishing in the Ukrainian language was outlawed. Nonetheless, by the late 18th century modern literary Ukrainian finally emerged.The 19th century initiated a vernacular period in Ukraine, led by Ivan Kotliarevsky's work Eneyida, the first publication written in modern Ukrainian. By the 1830s, Ukrainian romanticism began to develop, and the nation's most renowned cultural figure, romanticist poet-painter Taras Shevchenko emerged. Whereas Ivan Kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the Ukrainian vernacular; Shevchenko is the father of a national revival.Then, in 1863, use of the Ukrainian language in print was effectively prohibited by the Russian Empire. This severely curtailed literary activity in the area, and Ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in Russian or release them in Austrian controlled Galicia. The ban was never officially lifted, but it became obsolete after the revolution and the Bolsheviks' coming to power.Ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early Soviet years, when nearly all literary trends were approved (the most important literary figures of that time were Mykola Khvylovy, Valerian Pidmohylny, Mykola Kulish, Mykhayl Semenko and some others). These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by the NKVDduring the Great Purge. In general around 223 writers were repressed by what was known as the Executed Renaissance. These repressions were part of Stalin's implemented policy of socialist realism. The doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the Ukrainian language, but it required that writers follow a certain style in their works.  In post-Stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the Communist Party. The most famous figures of Ukrainian post-war Soviet literature were Lina Kostenko, Dmytro Pavlychko, Borys Oliynyk (poet), Ivan Drach, Oles Honchar, Vasyl Stus, Vasyl Symonenko. 
Literary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the USSR and the reestablishment of Ukrainian independence in 1991.  Ukrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by Ukrainians worldwide. 
These include initial roots which were established in the Eastern Slavic state of Kievan Rus'. Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus' for several ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by the Byzantine architecture. After the 12th century, the distinct architectural history continued in the principalities of Galicia-Volhynia.  During the epoch of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the union with the Tsardom of Russia, many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area were built in the styles of Russian architecture of that period, whilst the western Galicia was developed under Austro-Hungarian architectural influences. Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the Soviet Union and in modern independent Ukraine. 
The great churches of the Rus', built after the adoption of Christianity in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kyivan state was strongly influenced by the Byzantine. Early Eastern Orthodox churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a cell church. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.  Several examples of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the Ukrainian Baroque style (see below). Examples include the grand St. Sophia of Kyiv—the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, Church of the Saviour at Berestove—built from 1113 to 1125 and St. Cyril's Church, circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. 
Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the Assumption Cathedral in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896–1900, the Paraskevi church in Chernihiv, built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the Golden gates in Kyiv, built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or vernacular architecture of Kievan Rus' has survived.  As Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the Russian Empire, Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. St. Andrew's Church of Kyiv (1747–1754), built by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, is a notable example of Baroque architecture, and its location on top of the Kyivan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rastrelli was the Mariinskyi Palace, which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress Elizabeth. 
During the reign of the last Hetman of Ukraine, Kirill Razumovsky, many of the Cossack Hetmanate's towns such as Hlukhiv, Baturyn and Koselets had grandiose projects built by Andrey Kvasov. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as New Russia. New cities such as Nikolayev, Odessa, Kherson and Sevastopol were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.  In 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv. Previously, the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of Stalinist architecture were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, Brotherhood Monastery, and St. Nicholas Military Cathedral were destroyed. 
Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kyiv transformed Khreshchatyk avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.  The task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the Maidan Nezalezhnosti in central Kyiv. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre. 
A major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kyiv City-Centre on the Rybalskyi Peninsula, which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the Dnieper.  Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional folk music, to classical and modern rock, Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including Kirill Karabits, Okean Elzy and Ruslana. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern jazz. 
Ukrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.  During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the kobza, bandura or torban. 
The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv in 1738 and students were taught to sing and play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv or having been closely associated with this music school.  See: Dmytro Bortniansky, Maksym Berezovsky and Artemiy Vedel. 
Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the Ukrainian diaspora. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.  Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player Mariana Sadovska is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like Vopli Vidoplyasova, Dakh Daughters, Dakha Brakha, Ivan Dorn and Okean Elzy. 
Modern musical culture of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony in all regional centers.  Ukraine hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 and the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. 
Ukraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors Alexander Dovzhenko, often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of Soviet montage theory, Dovzhenko Film Studios, and Sergei Parajanov, Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.  Other important directors including Kira Muratova, Sergei Loznitsa, Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi, Larisa Shepitko, Sergei Bondarchuk, Leonid Bykov, Yuri Ilyenko, Leonid Osyka, Ihor Podolchak with his Delirium and Maryna Vroda. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: Vera Kholodnaya, Bohdan Stupka, Eugene Hütz, Milla Jovovich, Olga Kurylenko, Mila Kunis, Mark Ivanir. 
Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of European and Russian influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including Battleship Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Enthusiasm, Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom, Everything Is Illuminated, Mr Jones.  Ukrainian State Film Agency owns National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre, film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the Odessa International Film Festival, and Molodist is the only one FIAPF accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world. Held annually in October. 
Ukrayinska Pravda was founded by Georgiy Gongadze in April 2000 (the day of the Ukrainian constitutional referendum). Published mainly in Ukrainian with selected articles published in or translated to Russian and English, the newspaper has particular emphasis on the politics of Ukraine. Freedom of the press in Ukraine is considered to be among the freest of the post-Soviet states other than the Baltic states.  Freedom House classifies the Internet in Ukraine as "free" and the press as "partly free". Press freedom has significantly improved since the Orange Revolution of 2004. However, in 2010 Freedom House perceived "negative trends in Ukraine". 
Kyiv dominates the media sector in Ukraine: the Kyiv Post is Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper. National newspapers Den, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, tabloids, such as The Ukrainian Week or Focus, and television and radio are largely based there, although Lviv is also a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine, Ukrinform was founded here in 1918. The Ukrainian publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. Sanoma publishes Ukrainian editions of such magazines as Esquire, Harpers Bazaar and National Geographic Magazine. BBC Ukrainian started its broadcasts in 1992.  Ukrainians listen to radio programming, such as Radio Ukraine or Radio Liberty, largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many websites are popular. 
Ukraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on physical education. These policies left Ukraine with hundreds of stadia, swimming pools, gymnasia and many other athletic facilities. The most popular sport is football. The top professional league is the Vyscha Liha ("premier league").  Many Ukrainians also played for the Soviet national football team, most notably Ballon d'Or winners Ihor Belanov and Oleh Blokhin. This award was only presented to one Ukrainian after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Andriy Shevchenko. The national team made its debut in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions, Italy. 
Ukrainian boxers are amongst the best in the world. Since becoming the undisputed cruiserweight champion in 2018, Oleksandr Usyk has also gone on to win the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles. This feat made him one of only three boxers to have unified the cruiserweight world titles and become a world heavyweight champion. The brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are former heavyweight world champions who held multiple world titles throughout their careers. Also hailing from Ukraine is Vasyl Lomachenko, a 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold medalist. He is the unified lightweight world champion who ties the record for winning a world title in the fewest professional fights; three. As of September 2018, he is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by ESPN.Sergey Bubka held the record in the Pole vault from 1993 to 2014; with great strength, speed and gymnastic abilities, he was voted the world's best athlete on several occasions.Basketball is becoming popular in Ukraine. In 2011, Ukraine was granted a right to organize EuroBasket 2015. Two years later the Ukraine national basketball team finished 6th in EuroBasket 2013 and qualified to FIBA World Cup for the first time in its history. Euroleague participant Budivelnyk Kyiv is the strongest professional basketball club in Ukraine.  Chess is a popular sport in Ukraine. Ruslan Ponomariov is the former world champion. There are about 85 Grandmasters and 198 International Masters in Ukraine. 
Rugby league is played throughout Ukraine.Ukraine made its Olympic debut at the 1994 Winter Olympics.  The traditional Ukrainian diet includes chicken, pork, beef, fish and mushrooms. Ukrainians also tend to eat a lot of potatoes, grains, fresh, boiled or pickled vegetables. Popular traditional dishes include varenyky (boiled dumplings with mushrooms, potatoes, sauerkraut, cottage cheese, cherries or berries), nalysnyky (pancakes with cottage cheese, poppy seeds, mushrooms, caviar or meat), kapuśniak (soup made with meat, potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage, millet, tomato paste, spices and fresh herbs), borscht (soup made of beets, cabbage and mushrooms or meat), holubtsy (stuffed cabbage rolls filled with rice, carrots, onion and minced meat) and pierogi (dumplings filled with boiled potatoes and cheese or meat). Ukrainian specialties also include Chicken Kiev and Kyiv cake. Ukrainians drink stewed fruit, juices, milk, buttermilk (they make cottage cheese from this), mineral water, tea and coffee, beer, wine and horilka. The first coffeehouse in Austria was opened by Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, while modern Lviv is famous for its chocolate and coffee traditions.
