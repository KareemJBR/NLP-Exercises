Sending everyone lots of love right now. We hope you’re all doing your best to practice social distancing! Thank you so much to the Doctors, nurses, scientists, & everyone else working around the clock to help in the fight against #coronavirus. Be safe and we love you guys!
Them: we have to wear masks again 😔 Me: we stopped wearing masks? 🤔
The millennial urge to care more about not giving your family Covid than they care about getting it.
Nicki, if you wanna chat with a scientist and fan about the vaccine, I'm happy to talk! Much love... be safe
*me doing an at-home covid test* “lol, what am I even, an adorable little scientist?”
I was 23 before lockdown and in 2022 I will be turning 23 again. I don't want any questions
The coolest part of Covid is that it used to take seven years of school to become an epidemiologist but it only took all of us 18 months of Twitter.


== Olympics ==
the outpouring love & support I’ve received has made me realize I’m more than my accomplishments and gymnastics which I never truly believed before. 🤍
the only part of the olympics i can truly relate to is the canadian swimmer maggie macneil who didn't realise she won gold because she wasn't wearing her glasses in the pool
"Race-walking" seems very similar to "hurrying to the toilet in a crowded Marks and Spencers."
“I Do The Dancing And He Gets The Medal?” Dressage Horse Lashes Out At Olympics Inequality
The skateboarding in the Olympics is my favourite.
The replay of Maggie Mac Neil squinting before realizing she won gold — because she doesn't wear contacts when she swims — makes me laugh every time I see it
All the other athletes are ripped like fuck but these dudes turn up wearing baggy shorts & looking like they've been playing Fortnite for 10 hours.

== Pets ==
love when people try to hate on cats by saying. He would literally eat you if you died…. like im dead why would i care. hes a hungry boy. and he has a cute nose. dig in mr mittens
the only difficult part about wearing a mask when im out is that dogs on the street don’t know im smiling at them
my cat has a drinking water fountain and wont drink otherwise... when you eat the rich please spare her
my cat’s buddies with a possum and now i know what its like to be the parent of a teenager who falls in with the wrong crowd
Is there anything funnier than when a cozy cat or dog suddenly heaves a big SIGH like dude what could possibly be the matter
Normalize arguing with pets
A fun part of having a black cat is occasionally accidentally talking to a crumpled up black T-shirt on the floor
